The ALMM is a superior method for solving the constrained nonlinear programming problem. The details of the algorithm and several examples of its application are shown. The technique described allows the designer to arrive quickly at acceptable designs, without tedious trial-and-error in parameter changes. It is useful for designing magnets, because the cost is fairly reasonable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.120028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.120028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3427","startPage":"919","endPage":"922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3427/00120028.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Superconducting magnets","Superconducting coils","Constraint optimization","Superconducting filaments and wires","Magnetic fields","Magnetic flux","Lagrangian functions","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","nonlinear programming","superconducting magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal design method","minimum volume design","multi-section superconducting magnets","augmented Lagrangian multiplier method","ALMM","constrained nonlinear programming","algorithm","Nb/sub 3/Sn","NbTi"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An optimal design method for multi-section superconducting magnets","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4161890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120028/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal design method for multi-section superconducting magnets","sourcePdf":"00120028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024215S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","articleId":"120028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":120050,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The problem becomes more pronounced when the slave arm has to operate in a complex environment where every point of the arm body is subject to potential collision. Results are presented of experimental tests with human operators that trace the source of the difficulty to the limitations in human abilities for space orientation and interpretation of geometrical data, and a solution that capitalizes on recent developments in sensor-based motion planning for whole-sensitive robot arms is proposed. The result would be a hybrid system in which global planning is done by a human operator, whereas local collision-free motion is controlled by an assisting autopilot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4139250","volume":"21","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On human performance in telerobotics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On human performance in telerobotics","sourcePdf":"00120050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039215S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","isNumber":"3428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"31","articleId":"120050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120057,"authors":[{"name":"Z.B.

The necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality using Bayes' risk as the optimization criterion are then derived, and a physical interpretation of how the costates relate to the decision threshold at each node is provided. Using the min-H method of optimal control theory, a computationally efficient algorithm with linear complexity in the number of nodes per iteration is proposed to solve for the optimal decision strategy. The algorithm is then extended to solve a Neyman-Pearson version of the problem to obtain the optimal team (network) receiver operating characteristic curve.

Each sensor detects the presence of only a certain subset of a given set of objects O. Given that an object has been detected by a subset of sensors, the detection problem deals with identifying whether the object in the workspace is a member of O and, if so, computing the maximal set of such numbers. A conceptual graph structure called the detection network that yields efficient algorithms for the detection problem for combinational, message-based, sequential and parallel computing systems is proposed. The problem of computing a detection network with the minimum number of edges is shown to be computationally intractable, and polynomial-time approximation algorithms are presented. Sequential algorithms to solve the detection problem with and without preprocessing are presented. Parallel algorithms on shared memory systems and hypercube-based message passing systems are discussed. It is shown that the problem of detecting multiple objects is computationally intractable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4139258","displayDocTitle":"Computational complexity issues in synthesis of simple distributed detection networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational complexity issues in synthesis of simple distributed detection networks","sourcePdf":"00120059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043553S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","isNumber":"3428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"9","articleId":"120059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120069,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A neural optimization procedure is presented that does not require an initial estimate of the direction of the sources and offers the potential of real-time solutions to the direction of arrival problem by utilizing the fast relaxation properties of the Hopfield network. A modification based on an iterated descent procedure is introduced into the Hopfield model dynamic equation to increase the probability of convergence to the global optimum. The algorithms are implemented on an array of closely coupled transputers that perform the random asynchronous neural updates in parallel. The mapping is achieved using a technique called chaotic relaxation.

Data obtained for the frequency-dependent epsilon /sub reff/ of uniform SSLs and both scattering and equivalent circuit parameters of various series gap discontinuities are presented. In general, the presence of sidewall mounting grooves causes a nearly frequency-independent small reduction in epsilon /sub reff/. On the other hand, proximity effects of the housing are found to be more important. For the gap discontinuity, coupling across the gap is stronger for wider strips and/or narrower gap width. Irregular transmission behavior is also found when the strip is wide enough to interact strongly with the sidewalls.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3429/00120100.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.120100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.120100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of dispersion and series gap discontinuity in shielded suspended striplines with substrate mounting grooves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Strips","Stripline","Dielectric substrates","Time series analysis","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectric constant","Coaxial components","Distributed parameter circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","strip line components","strip lines","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["housing proximity effect","wave dispersion","permittivity calculation","sidewall interaction","irregular transmission behavior","series gap discontinuity","shielded suspended striplines","substrate mounting grooves","Duroid substrate","finite-difference time-domain method","FD-TD","air-filled rectangular coaxial transmission line","equivalent circuit parameters","sidewall mounting grooves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of dispersion and series gap discontinuity in shielded suspended striplines with substrate mounting grooves","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4139012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of dispersion and series gap discontinuity in shielded suspended striplines with substrate mounting grooves","sourcePdf":"00120100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061697S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","articleId":"120100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120108,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-fa-Lee","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Jin-fa-Lee","id":"37280305700"},{"name":"R.

All computations are performed and validated applying the three-dimensional multiple multipole software package. The numerical model of the plane phantom is additionally checked by accurate as possible experimental measurements. For the plane phantom, the interaction mechanism can be described well by H-field induced surface currents. The spatial peak specific absorption rate can be approximated within 3 dB by a formula given here based on the incident H-field or antenna current and on the conductivity and permittivity of the tissue. These findings can be generalized to heterogeneous tissues and larger biological bodies of arbitrary shape for frequencies above 300 MHz. The specific absorption rate is mainly proportional to the square of the incident H-field, which implies that in the close near field, the spatial peak specific absorption rate is related to the antenna current and not to the input power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.120141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3431/00120141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.120141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3431","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy absorption mechanism by biological bodies in the near field of dipole antennas above 300 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy absorption mechanism by biological bodies in the near field of dipole antennas above 300 MHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4166196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy absorption mechanism by biological bodies in the near field of dipole antennas above 300 MHz","sourcePdf":"00120141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048565S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"219","articleId":"120141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":120142,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The reservation-busy-tone multiple access (R-BTMA) is a fully distributed and reservation-based protocol. It is a medium access control (MAC) protocol designed for short-range communications between vehicles in a decentralized context (i.e., without a base station). The specificity of this protocol relies on the utilization of two different characteristic channels. Information is transmitted on the data channel (DC), whereas the busy-tone channel (BTC) is used for signalling traffic. The range of the BTC is typically longer than the DC one. The throughput and access delay performance are studied in the particular context of two cells sharing a common BTC. The traffic between the vehicles is supposed to be regular and is parameter sharing.

The performance for NEC receivers with single, double, and triple error correction capability is theoretically analyzed and evaluated. For the CCI, the general model, which includes M statistical independent interferers also employing the pi /4-shift DQPSK modulation format, is adopted. The theoretical symbol error probability versus carrier-to-noise ratio have been obtained with M and the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) as parameters. The results indicate significant performance improvements over conventional differentially detected systems. Some of the results have been verified by computer simulation. The gains offered by the NEC receivers increase as C/I decreases and/or M increases.

The approach is to minimize the transmitter output power in spectral regions occupied only by intermodulation (IM) products. In this way, only a spot power measurement is required. This technique relies on the principle that the power amplifier's characteristics vary slowly with time. By monitoring the out-of-band power one can obtain an estimate for the distortion introduced by the power amplifier. Adaptation is accomplished by iterative adjustment of the predistorter parameters to minimize the IM power. For a polynomial predistorter, the authors analytically demonstrate that the IM power is a quadratic function of the coefficients. A variety of algorithms therefore apply. The authors present an analog static predistortion linearization circuit that uses the envelope of the baseband signal to generate the nonlinear functional used in predistorting the input signal. The improvement obtained with an amplitude-modulated input signal was 15 dB in the third- and 5 dB in the fifth-order intermodulation products. The IM improvement could be maintained with the use of a robust direct search algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3431/00120144.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.120144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.120144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive predistorter for a power amplifier based on adjacent channel emissions (mobile communications)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Transmitters","Power generation","Power measurement","Monitoring","Nonlinear distortion","Polynomials","Iterative algorithms","Predistortion","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","intermodulation","mobile radio systems","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter output power minimisation","adjacent channel interference","adaptive predistorter","power amplifier","adjacent channel emissions","mobile communications","intermodulation","spot power measurement","out-of-band power","iterative adjustment","polynomial predistorter","analog static predistortion linearization circuit","amplitude-modulated input signal","robust direct search algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive predistorter for a power amplifier based on adjacent channel emissions (mobile communications)","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4166199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive predistorter for a power amplifier based on adjacent channel emissions (mobile communications)","sourcePdf":"00120144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041517S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"117","articleId":"120144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120145,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Efficient interference management aims at achieving acceptable carrier-to-interference ratios in all active communication links in the system. Such schemes for the control of cochannel interference are investigated. The effect of adjacent channel interference is neglected. As a performance measure, the interference (outage) probability is used, i.e., the probability that a randomly chosen link is subject to excessive interference. In order to derive upper performance bounds for transmitter power control schemes, algorithms that are optimum in the sense that the interference probability is minimized are suggested. Numerical results indicate that these upper bounds exceed the performance of conventional systems by an order of magnitude regarding interference suppression and by a factor of 3 to 4 regarding the system capacity. The structure of the optimum algorithm shows that efficient power control and dynamic channel assignment algorithms are closely related.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4166200","volume":"41","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimum transmitter power control in cellular radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimum transmitter power control in cellular radio systems","sourcePdf":"00120145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05067S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"850","articleId":"120145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120146,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The strategy provides guaranteed services per connection with no packet loss and an end-to-end delay which is a constant plus a small bounded jitter term. It is composed of an admission policy imposed per connection at the source node, and a particular queuing scheme practiced at the switching nodes, which is called stop-and-go queuing. The admission policy requires the packet stream of each connection to possess a certain smoothness property upon arrival at the network. This is equivalent to a peak bandwidth allocation per connection. The queuing scheme eliminates the process of packet clustering and thereby preserves the smoothness property as packets travel inside the network. Implementation is simple.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.120166","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/3432/00120166.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.120166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion-free communication in high-speed packet networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Communication system control","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Jitter","Data communication","Intserv networks","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed packet networks","packet clustering","well-regulated input traffic","congestion-free communication","guaranteed services per connection","end-to-end delay","small bounded jitter term","admission policy","source node","queuing scheme","switching nodes","stop-and-go queuing","smoothness property","peak bandwidth allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Congestion-free communication in high-speed packet networks","volume":"39","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4123535","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion-free communication in high-speed packet networks","sourcePdf":"120166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022984S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"120","articleId":"120166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":120169,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The implementation and generation of these techniques using the parallel processing INMOS transputer are discussed, and the concurrency programming ability of the transputer for PWM generation is emphasized. The implementation of the new PWM strategy can also be performed on any standard 8 or 16 b microprocessor using 4 or 1 timer implementations.

In order to implement closed loop torque control, current sensors are also unavoidable. These sensors can constitute a substantial portion of the total system cost and tend to reduce system reliability. A low-cost position-sensing scheme using stator inductance measurement is presented. An analog electronic technique can be applied to measure the inductance of a nonconducting phase by using a linear frequency modulated (FM) converter. The output of the FM converter is decoded to get the shaft position signal. The control functions and converter switching signals are processed in a low-cost microcontroller. The discrete current sensors for closed-loop operation have been eliminated by using MOS-gated power switches with integrated current sensing capability.

The phase inductance of an IPM synchronous motor varies appreciably as a function of the rotor position. This feature is utilized to get an estimate of the rotor position. Analytical equations are developed for the calculation of the phase inductance of an IPM motor driven by a current-controlled PWM power converter with a hysteresis controller. The calculated phase inductance is used to estimate the position of the rotor. To obtain an unambiguous relation between the phase inductance and the rotor position, the phase inductance of phases a, b, and c is calculated during different segments of each electrical cycle. A direct approach to inductance calculation is proposed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the controller. The position error is very small for speed control applications. A current regulator using constant-frequency switching is analyzed in order to avoid the random switching of the hysteresis current controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.120223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"144","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3434/00120223.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.120223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel position sensor elimination technique for the interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Rotors","Synchronous motors","Magnetic sensors","Magnetic analysis","Equations","Hysteresis motors","Induction motors","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","electric drives","machine control","permanent magnet motors","position control","power convertors","rotors","switching","synchronous motors","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","machine control","synchronous motor drive","phase inductance","rotor position","PWM power converter","hysteresis controller","speed control","current regulator","switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"A novel position sensor elimination technique for the interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4139280","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120223/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel position sensor elimination technique for the interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive","sourcePdf":"00120223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026955S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","isNumber":"3434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"170","articleId":"120223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120225,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Stator yoke, tooth tip and external search coils, and thermocouples were installed for test purposes. A shaft torque transducer was installed in line with a DC-load machine. The cross section of the machine was modeled with finite elements, and the field distribution and mechanical performance were computed using a nonlinear complex steady-state technique. Broken bars were shown to produce high localized airgap fields and to degrade mechanical performance. The field perturbation associated with broken bars, which are deliberately disconnected from the endrings by machining, produces low-frequency components and harmonics in the search coil-induced voltages and give rise to an oscillatory torque that produces noise and mechanical vibration. Experimental results show that analysis of the voltage induced in an external search coil is adequate to detect the presence of broken bars.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3434/00120226.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.120226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.120226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of broken bars in the cage rotor on an induction machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bars","Induction machines","Coils","Torque","Stators","Teeth","Testing","Shafts","Transducers","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4-pole induction machine","broken bar detection","stator yoke","deep-bar cage rotor","tooth tip","external search coils","thermocouples","shaft torque transducer","finite elements","field distribution","mechanical performance","nonlinear complex steady-state technique","localized airgap fields","mechanical performance","oscillatory torque","30 hp"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Detection of broken bars in the cage rotor on an induction machine","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4139283","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of broken bars in the cage rotor on an induction machine","sourcePdf":"00120226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070313S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","isNumber":"3434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"207","articleId":"120226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120327,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This problem is typical of ill-conditioned inverse problems that frequently arise in low-level computer vision. A conventional method to stabilize the problem is to introduce a priori constraints on X/sup 0/ and design a cost functional H(X) over images X, which is a weighted average of the prior constraints (regularization term) and posterior constraints (data term); the reconstruction is then the image X, which minimizes H. A prominent weakness in this approach, especially with quadratic-type stabilizers, is the difficulty in recovering discontinuities. The authors therefore examine prior smoothness constraints of a different form, which permit the recovery of discontinuities without introducing auxiliary variables for marking the location of jumps and suspending the constraints in their vicinity. In this sense, discontinuities are addressed implicitly rather than explicitly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3436/00120331.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.120331","doi":"10.1109/34.120331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained restoration and the recovery of discontinuities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Constrained restoration and the recovery of discontinuities","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120331/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4151468","volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained restoration and the recovery of discontinuities","sourcePdf":"00120331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041855S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"711","articleId":"120331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120349,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

These techniques generalize the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding techniques, which were proposed more than 20 years ago. The principal classes of classical equalization techniques are described, and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding is introduced. It is shown that precoding combines nicely with coded modulation and with a technique known as shaping. It is also shown that, in principle, optimized combinations of coding, shaping, and precoding can achieve nearly the channel capacity of any strictly band-limited, high-SNR Gaussian channel, and in practice can approach capacity within about 3 dB or less.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","volume":"29","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4123628","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Combined equalization and coding using precoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined equalization and coding using precoding","sourcePdf":"00120349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055613S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"185","articleId":"120349","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":120350,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

It employs an Si bipolar differential transimpedance amplifier, an auto-threshold tracking level control circuit, and a DC-coupled decision circuit (ECL compatible quantizer). To cope with intermittent data packets, the threshold control circuit can capture data amplitude and set the logic threshold in about 1 ns. Using an avalanche photodiode, the typical receiver sensitivity is -37.5 dBm (10/sup -9/ BER) at bit rates up to 900 Mb/s, with a dynamic range of 23 dB for both pseudorandom and burst-mode signals. At 1 Gb/s, the sensitivity is -35 dBm. With a worst-case reset time <100 ns for the threshold control circuit, this receiver can be used for optical bus applications where data signals with varying optical power are employed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.120581","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3443/00120581.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.120581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-1 Gb/s burst-mode compatible receiver for optical bus applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120581/","displayDocTitle":"DC-1 Gb/s burst-mode compatible receiver for optical bus applications","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4150817","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-1 Gb/s burst-mode compatible receiver for optical bus applications","sourcePdf":"00120581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061533S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"43","articleId":"120581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120582,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Feasibility studies show that an 80*80 ULPHA switch with 1-Gb/s input/output is possible by applying the present technology, and that more than 1 Tb/s is possible by making a three-stage network using such switches. As an experimental demonstration, 4-bit 40-Gb/s optical cells were generated and certain cells were selected at an output on a self-routing basis.

The routing table problem is presented by discussing the available architectures and how they are related. It is shown that simple table lookup is just a special case of the standard trie structure and that the use of partitioning combined with the trie structure provides a continuum that can lead to a CAM implementation at one extreme. The high-level tradeoffs in the choice of various parameters for the trie are estimated. A careful choice of word size can balance the requirements for speed with the costs of area. Also considered are the costs and benefits of splitting the table into a number of tries, which are searched simultaneously. VLSI implementations are outlined, and the costs are compared. General CAM structures are not needed for the routing table application, and custom CAMs can be very efficient. Tries, however, can be competitive in many cases, due to the resources available for building conventional memories.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/3448/00120723.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/65.120723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.120723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Putting routing tables in silicon","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Silicon","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Very large scale integration","Costs","ISO standards","Asynchronous transfer mode","ISDN","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","switching networks","table lookup","telecommunication networks","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["custom VLSI","communication networks","routing tables","RAM","semicustom VLSI","table lookup","trie structure","partitioning","CAM","word size","costs","memories","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Putting routing tables in silicon","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4119305","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Putting routing tables in silicon","sourcePdf":"00120723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029033S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"61","articleId":"120723","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120771,"authors":[{"name":"B.-R.

These two techniques were applied to encode test images at about 0.51 b/pixel and 0.73 b/pixel. The performances of both techniques over a noisy channel have been also tested in the transform domain. The performances of both adaptive VQ techniques are perceptually very similar for the noise-free channel case.

Adaptive quantisation techniques conforming to the MPEG syntax can significantly improve the performance of the encoder. The authors concentrate on a one-pass causal scheme to limit the complexity of the encoder. The system employs prestored models for perceptual quality and a bit rate that have been experimentally derived. A framework is provided for determining these models as well as adapting them to locally varying scene characteristics. The variance of an 8*8 (luminance) block is basic to the techniques developed. Following standard practice, it is defined as the average of the square of the deviations of the pixels in the block from the mean pixel value.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3451/00120774.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.120774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.120774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-compensated video coding with adaptive perceptual quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Quantization","Discrete cosine transforms","Video compression","Transform coding","Motion pictures","Bit rate","Standards organizations","HDTV","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","picture processing","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPEG quantizer","motion compensated video coding","adaptive perceptual quantization","Motion Picture Experts Group","bit rates","reconstructed video","MPEG syntax","encoder","one-pass causal scheme","prestored models","perceptual quality","locally varying scene characteristics","luminance","1.0 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Motion-compensated video coding with adaptive perceptual quantization","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4110682","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-compensated video coding with adaptive perceptual quantization","sourcePdf":"00120774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06163S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"98","articleId":"120774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120776,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Because the operations needed are mostly independent of each other and have a high degree of regularity, it is also possible to design very-large-scale integration (VLSI) hardware to perform this operation using an array of simple basic cells. For a typical 513*513 image one can achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB with an entropy of 0.133 b/pixel.

The major feature of this algorithm is that its search speed for the motion vector is faster than that of the other search algorithms on account of its simpler computations and parallelism. Compared with previous research in terms of four measurements, the PHODS can rival those algorithms for performance.

The coder can operate at intermediate bit rates and can also change bit rate on a packet-by-packet basis. Variable bit rate operation is achieved through the use of switched quantization, thus eliminating the need for buffering of the output. A noise shaping filter provides flexible control of the output noise spectrum. The filter, in conjunction with an enhanced way to adapt the quantizer step size, which tries to accommodate the quantization noise feedback, accounts for the toll quality. By quantizing the residue with more than one quantizer, the effective number of bits per sample can be controlled in a deterministic way regardless of the entropy residue. The lower limit of operation is at 9.6 kb/s. Performance of the coder under random bit errors is also presented. It has been found that only at error rates of 10/sup -2/ and higher does the degradation becomes objectionable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120794/","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4167896","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Variable bit rate adaptive predictive coder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable bit rate adaptive predictive coder","sourcePdf":"00120794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037853S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","articleId":"120794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":120797,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

The crux of the problem lies in the determination of the necessary least squares frequency response weighting function. A novel iterative algorithm for deriving the least squares frequency response weighting function which will produce a quasi-equiripple design is presented. The algorithm converges very rapidly. It typically produces a design which is only about 1 dB away from the minimax optimum solution in two iterations and converges to within 0.1 dB in six iterations. Convergence speed is independent of the order of the filter.

The Markov property results in the compact parametrization of the backscatter echo field by a few parameters, and constitutes a huge reduction in the representation and analysis complexity of the backscatter image. Use is made of the intensity as well as phase information, associated with the acoustic image by analyzing and modeling the acoustic RF data rather than the intensity data. The additional phase information associated with the RF data allows for the statistics of the complex backscatter echo field or, equivalently, that of the RF field to be completely specified. The approach provides a coherent theoretical basis for the design of statistical tests for detecting targets embedded in the speckle image, for the case where the speckle model parameters are either a priori known or unknown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.120805","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3452/00120805.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.120805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"624","endPage":"632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of ultrasound speckle with application in flaw detection in metals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=120805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of ultrasound speckle with application in flaw detection in metals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120805/","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4167907","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of ultrasound speckle with application in flaw detection in metals","sourcePdf":"00120805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041841S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","articleId":"120805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":120811,"authors":[{"name":"S.

IVA's interpretation concepts provide an internally consistent vocabulary based on value theory for talking about decisions. IVA's explanation component explains the operation-by-operation computation of a comparison of two alternatives, using interpretation concepts, operation explainers, and the difference-function topology. IVA's diagnosis-and-repair method uses this explanation component, along with modules for suggesting, repairing, and verifying the integrity of parameter values, to assist users with modifying models that deviate from their preferences. This approach suggests that knowledge engineers can retain the benefits of decision theory's formal foundation without compromising intuitive explanation and knowledge acquisition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CAIA.1991.120883","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings.

The VRPTW involves routing a fleet of vehicles, of limited capacity and travel time, from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands within specified time windows. The authors describe GIDEON, a genetic algorithm system to heuristically solve the VRPTW. GIDEON consists of two distinct modules: a global clustering module that assigns customers to vehicles by a process called genetic sectoring (GENSECT) and a local route optimization module (SWITCH-OPT). On a standard set of 56 VRPTW problems obtained from the literature, GIDEON did better than the alternate methods on 41 of them, with an average reduction of 3.9% in fleet size and 4.4% in distance traveled for the 56 problems. GIDEON took an average of 127 CPU seconds to solve a problem on the Solbourne 5/802 computer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/120888/","accessionNumber":"3985589","isConference":true,"volume":"i","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"GIDEON: a genetic algorithm system for vehicle routing with time windows","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GIDEON: a genetic algorithm system for vehicle routing with time windows","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00120888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042084S","chronDate":"24-28 Feb 1991","isNumber":"3453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"331","citationCount":"49","articleId":"120888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":121475,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The reconfigurable parallel-processing system assumed for the discussions is a multiprocessor system capable of mixed-mode parallelism; that is, it can operate in either the SIMD or MIMD modes of parallelism and can dynamically switch between modes at instruction-level granularity with generally negligible overhead. In addition, it can be partitioned into independent or communicating submachines, each having the same characteristics as the original machine. Furthermore, this reconfigurable system model uses a flexible multistage cube interconnection network, which allows the connection patterns among the processors to be varied. It is demonstrated how reconfigurability can be used by reviewing and examining five computer-vision-related algorithms, each one emphasizing a different aspect of reconfigurability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.121475","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/3458/00121475.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.121475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping computer-vision-related tasks onto reconfigurable parallel-processing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Mapping computer-vision-related tasks onto reconfigurable parallel-processing systems","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4138172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping computer-vision-related tasks onto reconfigurable parallel-processing systems","sourcePdf":"00121475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034523S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"40","articleId":"121475","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":121508,"authors":[{"name":"G.

When information is combined from multiple databases, the major concern is the mismatch encountered in information representation and structure. Intelligent and active use of information requires a class of software modules that mediate between the workstation applications and the databases. It is shown that mediation simplifies, abstracts, reduces, merges, and explains data. A mediator is a software module that exploits encoded knowledge about certain sets or subsets of data to create information for a higher layer of applications. A model of information processing and information system components is described. The mediator architecture, including mediator interfaces, sharing of mediator modules, distribution of mediators, and triggers for knowledge maintenance, are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.121508","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/3459/00121508.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.121508","publicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"38","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mediators in the architecture of future information systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Mediators in the architecture of future information systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121508/","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4161424","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mediators in the architecture of future information systems","sourcePdf":"00121508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076532S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"1142","articleId":"121508","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":121509,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The fundamental premise behind the architecture is that it is possible to build a scalable high-performance machine with a single address space and coherent caches. The Dash architecture is scalable in that it achieves linear or near-linear performance growth as the number of processors increases from a few to a few thousand. This performance results from distributing the memory among processing nodes and using a network with scalable bandwidth to connect the nodes. The architecture allows shared data to be cached, significantly reducing the latency of memory accesses and yielding higher processor utilization and higher overall performance. A distributed directory-based protocol that provides cache coherence without compromising scalability is discussed in detail. The Dash prototype machine and the corresponding software support are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.121510","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/3459/00121510.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.121510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Stanford Dash multiprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121510/","displayDocTitle":"The Stanford Dash multiprocessor","volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4161426","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Stanford Dash multiprocessor","sourcePdf":"00121510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039184S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"571","articleId":"121510","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":121546,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.

Four classes of logic block architecture are investigated: NAND gates, multiplexer configurations, lookup tables, and wide-input AND-OR gates. An experimental approach is taken, in which each of a set of benchmark logic circuits is synthesized into FPGAs that use different logic blocks. The speed of the resulting FPGA implementations using each logic block is measured. While the results depend on the delay of the programmable routing, experiments indicate that five- and six-input lookup tables and certain multiplexer configurations produce the lowest total delay over realistic values of routing delay. The fine grain blocks, such as the two-input NAND gate, exhibit poor performance because these gates require many levels of logic block to implement the circuits and hence require a large routing delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.121549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3460/00121549.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.121549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of logic block architecture on FPGA performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"The effect of logic block architecture on FPGA performance","volume":"27","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4138957","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of logic block architecture on FPGA performance","sourcePdf":"00121549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118795S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"56","articleId":"121549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":121550,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

For a parallel RISC processor, the major issues are the construction of arithmetic modules in a small number of transistors and the shortening of the cycle time as well as the delay time. The feedbacked massive-input logic (FML) concept is proposed to meet these requirements. It reduces the number of transistors and the power within the framework of fully static logic 3-4 times. A low-voltage BiCMOS D-flip-flop is also conceived to allow the single-phase clocking scheme, which is favorable for high-frequency operation of RISCs. To demonstrate these circuit techniques, a 32-b ALU is designed and fabricated using 0.3- mu m BiCMOS to demonstrate 1.6 times performance leverage over CMOS at 3.3 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.121560","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3460/00121560.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.121560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"373","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3.3-V BiCMOS circuit techniques for 250-MHz RISC arithmetic modules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"3.3-V BiCMOS circuit techniques for 250-MHz RISC arithmetic modules","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121560/","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4138968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3.3-V BiCMOS circuit techniques for 250-MHz RISC arithmetic modules","sourcePdf":"00121560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042787S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"121560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":121563,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

Two image reorganization processors are realized on the focal-plane and two are designed for hybridization to a separate imager IC. The two focal-plane ICs represent the first integration of a 256*256 buried-channel frame-transfer CCD image sensor with additional charge-domain circuitry to enable image reformatting at video rates (28 frames/s). The four ICs generate pyramidal pixel output in 3*3 blocks with the center pixel first. Pixel data reorganization is performed through simultaneous readout of three rows of data, followed by pixel resequencing and sampling to provide differential output. A novel architecture provides simultaneous readout of multiple imager rows on the focal-plane ICs. The ICs have achieved a charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) of 0.99996 in the conventional horizontal and vertical CCD registers, and a CTE of 0.99994 in the SP/sup 3/ registers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.121563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3460/00121563.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.121563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CCD focal-plane image reorganization processors for lossless image compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121563/","displayDocTitle":"CCD focal-plane image reorganization processors for lossless image compression","volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4138971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CCD focal-plane image reorganization processors for lossless image compression","sourcePdf":"00121563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064229S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"121563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":121565,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

This analysis has identified that the latch transistor threshold voltage variation, rather than layout capacitance difference, is the cause of the original imbalance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.121570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.121570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3460/00121570.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Identification of DRAM sense-amplifier imbalance using hot-carrier evaluation","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4138978","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of DRAM sense-amplifier imbalance using hot-carrier evaluation","sourcePdf":"00121570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025832S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"2","articleId":"121570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":121593,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.R.

The system implementation involves a pipelined special-purpose computer connected to a standard television camera. A novel design and the use of standard components have made for a low-cost portable prototype conversion system with a power dissipation suitable for battery operation.

The residual current after a light pulse, which causes image lag for the imaging device, was most sensitive to light exposure among several properties, so that the residual current determines the lifetime for the photoconversion layer. The space charge was also increased with increasing residual current by light exposure, because both properties reflected light-induced defect states. The space charge was found to be a good monitor for the photodegradation. The space-charge density had light intensity and exposure-time dependency, which is similar to that for dangling bond density. The lifetime for the photoconversion layer, which was evaluated through the space-charge density change, was 1.5*10/sup 7/ h under standard illumination for the imager.

Finally, the authors propose a nonlinear HBT model suitable for IDM calculations, show how to measure its parameters, and verify its accuracy experimentally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intermodulation in heterojunction bipolar transistors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.121719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3466/00121719.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.121719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121719/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Intermodulation in heterojunction bipolar transistors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4146249","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermodulation in heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00121719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039661S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"106","articleId":"121719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":121722,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Each element in the array consists of a single FET oscillator with an input port for injection of the locking signal and an output port which is connected to a patch radiator. The array is synchronized using a 16-way power dividing network which distributes the locking signal to the oscillating elements. The array is constructed using a two-sided microstrip configuration, with the oscillators and feed network on one side of a ground plane, and the patch radiators on the opposite side. An effective radiated power (ERP) of 28.2 W CW with an isotropic conversion gain of 9.9 dB was measured at 6 GHz. For an injected power of 10.3 dBm, a locking range of 453 MHz at a center frequency of 6.015 GHz was obtained; a bandwidth of 7.5%. Because of the simple nature of the individual oscillator elements, this approach is well suited to MMIC implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.121722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3466/00121722.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.121722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16 element quasi-optical FET oscillator power combining array with external injection locking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 16 element quasi-optical FET oscillator power combining array with external injection locking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4146252","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16 element quasi-optical FET oscillator power combining array with external injection locking","sourcePdf":"00121722.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024615S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"96","articleId":"121722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":121728,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.

Several methods are provided in the literature to deal with this type of structure. A comparative study of quasi-TEM and rigorous solutions is carried out in order to establish criteria for the validity of the quasi-TEM approach. Reliable quasi-TEM and full-wave numerical data have been properly generated by applying an enhanced spectral domain analysis. The authors conclude that the quasi-TEM model yields satisfactory results for many MIC and MMIC practical cases. However, significant errors arise when high conductivity substrates are involved in MMIC applications. A discussion about the computation of the dynamic modal characteristic impedance is also reported, showing how the insertion of the modal orthogonality can save computational effort in a lossy multiport system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.121728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3466/00121728.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.121728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the quasi-TEM and full-wave approaches applied to coplanar multistrip on lossy dielectric layered media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the quasi-TEM and full-wave approaches applied to coplanar multistrip on lossy dielectric layered media","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4146258","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the quasi-TEM and full-wave approaches applied to coplanar multistrip on lossy dielectric layered media","sourcePdf":"00121728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032433S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"46","articleId":"121728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":121729,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Hence, near-minimum average job response time is expected for distributed systems with high-speed communication subnets. The performance is studied for systems with nonnegligible job transfer delays in the following three aspects: average job response time, overhead due to information exchanges, and sensitivity to heterogeneous load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4146396","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic load-balancing policy with a central job dispatcher (LBC)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic load-balancing policy with a central job dispatcher (LBC)","sourcePdf":"00121756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045199S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"94","articleId":"121756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":121783,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.

By analyzing this optical structure, one can infer the depths of the objects in the scene, i.e. one can achieve single lens stereo. The authors describe a camera for performing this analysis. It incorporates a single main lens along with a lenticular array placed at the sensor plane. The resulting plenoptic camera provides information about how the scene would look when viewed from a continuum of possible viewpoints bounded by the main lens aperture. Deriving depth information is simpler than in a binocular stereo system because the correspondence problem is minimized. The camera extracts information about both horizontal and vertical parallax, which improves the reliability of the depth estimates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.121783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3469/00121783.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.121783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single lens stereo with a plenoptic camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121783/","displayDocTitle":"Single lens stereo with a plenoptic camera","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4139379","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single lens stereo with a plenoptic camera","sourcePdf":"00121783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030838S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"680","articleId":"121783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":121785,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These super segments are entered into a table and provide the essential mechanism for fast retrieval and matching. The issues of robustness and stability of the features are addressed in detail. The acquisition of the 3-D models is performed automatically by computing splashes in highly structured areas of the objects and by using boundary and surface edges for the generation of 3-D curves.

The approach first takes a set of 3-D volumetric modeling primitives and generates a hierarchical aspect representation based on the projected surfaces of the primitives; conditional probabilities capture the ambiguity of mappings between levels of the hierarchy. From a region segmentation of the input image, the authors present a formulation of the recovery problem based on the grouping of the regions into aspects. No domain-independent heuristics are used; only the probabilities inherent in the aspect hierarchy are exploited. Once the aspects are recovered, the aspect hierarchy is used to infer a set of volumetric primitives and their connectivity. As a front end to an object recognition system, the approach provides the indexing power of complex 3-D object-centered primitives while exploiting the convenience of 2-D viewer-centered aspect matching; aspects are used to represent a finite vocabulary of 3-D parts from which objects can be constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.121788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3469/00121788.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.121788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D shape recovery using distributed aspect matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121788/","displayDocTitle":"3-D shape recovery using distributed aspect matching","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4139384","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D shape recovery using distributed aspect matching","sourcePdf":"00121788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062414S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"171","articleId":"121788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":121789,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4139387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A method for registration of 3-D shapes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for registration of 3-D shapes","sourcePdf":"00121791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042149S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"9868","articleId":"121791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":121906,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The behavior of the conventional fixed-band controller and the proposed sinusoidal band controller has been thoroughly studied. Simulation results demonstrate that with no lockout (permitting a very high switching frequency) the current waveform can be confined within the desired hysteresis bands. At low lockout frequencies the current is not confined within the hysteresis bands and both fixed and sinusoidal band controllers give a high ripple. The study also shows that with a reasonable lockout frequency, a sinusoidal band control results in a reduced ripple and lower harmonic content. However, the switching frequency is higher with the sinusoidal bands. This should not be a major concern with the availability of fast switching devices that allow higher lockout frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.121913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.121913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3471","startPage":"63","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3471/00121913.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=121913","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Pulse width modulation inverters","Current control","Switching frequency","Hysteresis motors","Synchronous motors","Pulse modulation","Electric current control","Pulse width modulation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","electric current control","electrical engineering computing","invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed band controllers","computer simulation","sinusoidal band hysteresis current controllers","voltage source inverters","very high switching frequency","high ripple","lockout frequency","harmonic content"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of fixed and sinusoidal band hysteresis current controllers for voltage source inverters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4128956","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/121913/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of fixed and sinusoidal band hysteresis current controllers for voltage source inverters","sourcePdf":"00121913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039167S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","articleId":"121913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":121972,"authors":[{"name":"O.D.

The C4 joints are encapsulated by dispensing a bead of resin along an edge of the chip. The encapsulation flows underneath the chip by capillary action and completely fills the gap between the chip and the substrate. Optimization of the filler size distribution and resin rheology to get consistent flow under the chip without any bubbles is discussed. The filler size distribution and flow under the chip are shown to cross sections of several different materials including low-alpha-emitting encapsulants for memory applications. Novel encapsulant formulations were tested by videotaping the flow of encapsulant under transparent quartz chips. The formation of bubbles as the encapsulant flows around the C4 joints and irregularities in the surface of the substrate can clearly be seen. Proper C4 encapsulation provides virtually complete coverage around all C4 connections. C4 life testing over various temperature ranges show a 5 to 10 times improvement for both memory and logic footprints when the C4 joints are encapsulated. The vast improvement in C4-joint reliability provided by encapsulation allows the C4 technology to be extended to much larger chips or to higher service-temperature ranges without conventional DNP (distance from neural point) constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"40th Conference Proceedings on Electronic Components and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/157/3478/00122212.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"344 vol.1","publicationTitle":"40th Conference Proceedings on Electronic Components and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1990.122212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1990.122212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flip-chip solder bump fatigue life enhanced by polymer encapsulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fatigue","Polymers","Encapsulation","Thermal expansion","Life testing","Epoxy resins","Life estimation","Ceramics","Rheology","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encapsulation","fatigue testing","filled polymers","flip-chip devices","life testing","packaging","reliability","soldering","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-chip soldering","fatigue life enhancement","accelerated thermal cycle fatigue testing","encapsulant flow under chips","CTE matching","TCE matching","solder bump fatigue life","polymer encapsulation","controlled collapse chip connection","filled epoxy resin","matched coefficient of thermal expansion","C4 joints","ceramic chip carriers","capillary action","filler size distribution","resin rheology","low-alpha-emitting encapsulants","C4 encapsulation","life testing","reliability","larger chips","higher service-temperature ranges"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Flip-chip solder bump fatigue life enhanced by polymer encapsulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flip-chip solder bump fatigue life enhanced by polymer encapsulation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00122212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043125S","chronDate":"20-23 May 1990","isNumber":"3478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"157","citationCount":"64","articleId":"122212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":122276,"authors":[{"name":"K.

He tries to present a broad awareness that might reduce repetition and introduce a possible solution to the decoupling problem, noting that recent developments in high-speed decoupling have been in multiple simultaneous directions. The refinement of one design or technique has not necessarily led to the discovery of the next; rather, the developments in the different methods have usually been parallel, specific-application dictated. It is the multiple specific requirements that have led to the varied venues in design and technology. Attention is given to the development and utilization of the following devices: the four-terminal power entry capacitor, the power-plane decoupling capacitor, the 10- mu F 20-pH capacitor, and interdigitated leads.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 1990","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Advanced decoupling using ceramic MLC capacitors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced decoupling using ceramic MLC capacitors","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00122312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018447S","chronDate":"20-23 May 1990","isNumber":"3478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"157","citationCount":"4","articleId":"122312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":122353,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The system was loss limited with a T-R power budget of 57 dB. Three key components enabled the authors to achieve this result: (1) a Ti:LiNbO/sub 3/ external amplitude modulator enabling a dispersion-free transmission, (2) erbium-doped fiber amplifiers increasing the transmitting power to +16 dBm, and (3) an erbium-doped fiber preamplifier enabling a high-receiver sensitivity of -4.1 dBm for 10/sup -9/ BER. To the author's knowledge, this result is the longest repeaterless transmission span length ever reported for direct detection at this bit rate. From the experimental results and a theoretical model, the authors identified the sources of the receiver sensitivity degradation from the quantum limit (-48.6 dBm) and estimated the practically achievable receiver sensitivity of approximately -44 dBm ( approximately -124 photons/bit) for 2.5 Gb/s optical preamplifier detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4130740","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"2.488 Gb/s-318 km repeaterless transmission using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers in a direct-detection system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2.488 Gb/s-318 km repeaterless transmission using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers in a direct-detection system","sourcePdf":"00122354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088826S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"22","articleId":"122354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":122355,"authors":[{"name":"O.

With optimally designed lasers, CW (continuous-wave) threshold currents were 10-15 mA (250- mu m cavity, as-cleaved), slope efficiency was approximately 0.4 mW/mA (both facets) and SMSR (side-mode suppression ratio) was as high as 52 dB. The laser operated in the same DFB mode with SMSR staying approximately 50 dB throughout the entire current range. At 100 degrees C, the CW threshold current stayed low, approximately 50 mA, and SMSR was approximately 40 dB. Results also indicate that the presence of gain-coupling removes the degeneracy in lasing wavelength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.122369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.122369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3480","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3480/00122369.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122369","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed feedback devices","Indium phosphide","Laser feedback","Semiconductor lasers","Gratings","Laser modes","Threshold current","Phase modulation","Laser theory","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","distributed feedback lasers","gallium arsenide","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","laser modes","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductors","DFB lasers","CW lasing","grating quaternary layer thickness","distributed feedback lasers","gain-coupled mechanism","long-wavelength","low-threshold-current","gain-coupled","quaternary grating","InP-spacer layer","active layer","as-cleaved","slope efficiency","side-mode suppression ratio","DFB mode","CW threshold current","10 to 15 mA","100 degC","50 mA","InGaAsP-InP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Long-wavelength InGaAsP/InP distributed feedback lasers incorporating gain-coupled mechanism","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4163257","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122369/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-wavelength InGaAsP/InP distributed feedback lasers incorporating gain-coupled mechanism","sourcePdf":"00122369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045944S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"51","articleId":"122369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":122378,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The simulation results indicate that the modulation performance is sensitive to the precise time delay between the incident optical pulse and the electrical injection current pulse required to drive the traveling-wave semiconductor optical amplifier (TWSOA) external modulator. It is found that satisfactory modulation performance is obtained when the peak of the input optical pulse p/sub in/(t) coincides with the trailing edge of the injection current pulse I(t). The simulation results then indicate that, under this condition, adequate modulation performance at 2.5 Gb/s per channel, over a practically useful range of input signals, is possible provided that -10 dB<or= E/sub in//E/sub sat/ <or=0 dB. At the given pulse width used in the simulation ( approximately=80 ps at the base line), the multiplexed bit rate can be as high as 12.5 Gb/s in the proposed OTDM system, if the pulse spacing is adjusted for the maximum multiplexed bit rate.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/68.122393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.122393","endPage":"283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3480/00122393.pdf","startPage":"280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of 12.5 Gb/s lightwave optical time-division multiplexer using semiconductor optical amplifiers as external modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122393/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of 12.5 Gb/s lightwave optical time-division multiplexer using semiconductor optical amplifiers as external modulators","volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4163280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of 12.5 Gb/s lightwave optical time-division multiplexer using semiconductor optical amplifiers as external modulators","sourcePdf":"00122393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122225S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","articleId":"122393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":122394,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Bryant proposed a method to handle logic expressions (IEEE Trans. Comp., vol.25, no.8, p.667-91, 1986) which is based on binary decision diagrams (BDD) with restriction; variable ordering ix fixed throughout a diagram. The method is more efficient than other methods proposed so far and depends heavily on variable ordering. A simple but powerful algorithm for variable ordering is developed. The algorithm tries to find a variable ordering which minimizes the number of crosspoints of nets when the circuit diagram is drawn. This is applied to the Boolean comparison of ISCAS benchmark circuits for test pattern generation. The results show that binary decision diagrams (BDD) with the proposed ordering method can verify almost all benchmark circuits in less than several central processor unit (CPU) minutes, which is one hundred times (or more) faster than times reported in the literature. Some techniques for circuit evaluation ordering are also mentioned.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122450","publicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/212/3483/00122450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3483","startPage":"2","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation and improvement of Boolean comparison method based on binary decision diagrams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation and improvement of Boolean comparison method based on binary decision diagrams","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122450/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350202","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation and improvement of Boolean comparison method based on binary decision diagrams","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00122450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022673S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isNumber":"3483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"212","citationCount":"149","articleId":"122450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":122451,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Combinational logic verification involves checking two networks for functional equivalence. Techniques that flatten networks or use cube enumeration and simulation cannot be used with functions that have very large cube covers. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are canonical representations for Boolean functions and offer a technique for formal logic verification. However, the size of BDDs is sensitive to the variable ordering. Ordering strategies based on the network topology are considered. Using these strategies with BDDs, it has been possible to carry out formal verification for a larger set of networks than with existing verification systems. The present method proved significantly faster on the benchmark set of examples tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/212/3483/00122451.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic verification using binary decision diagrams in a logic synthesis environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data structures","Boolean functions","Network topology","Logic testing","Programmable logic arrays","Binary decision diagrams","Network synthesis","Logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","logic CAD","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","formal logic verification system","multilevel logic synthesis system","MIS","functional equivalence","cube enumeration","canonical representations","Boolean functions","variable ordering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Logic verification using binary decision diagrams in a logic synthesis environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350203","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic verification using binary decision diagrams in a logic synthesis environment","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00122451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043123S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isNumber":"3483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"212","citationCount":"262","articleId":"122451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":122467,"authors":[{"name":"Jingsheng Cong","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

The relationship between the implied values and the intermediate don't care set is presented. Then it is shown how this relationship can be exploited to reduce the number of tautology calls and the number of leaves in the binary recursion tree of tautology checking. A parallelized version MLTAUT2P, which runs on a Sun 3/75 LAN, is discussed.

Cascade decomposition algorithms, which decompose a given machine into an independent and dependent component, have been proposed in the past. However, good cascade decompositions rarely exist in finite-state machine designs. A more powerful form of decomposition whereby both components of the decomposed machine interact with each other is proposed. This form of decomposition involves identifying subroutines or factors in the original machine, extracting these factors, and representing them as a separate factoring machine. The occurrences of these factors become calls to the factoring machine from the factored machine. Given a state-transition-graph description of a machine, algorithms which can identify factors in the machine that produce good decompositions have been developed. Experimental results indicate that this factoring technique is superior to cascade decomposition techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/212/3483/00122482.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition and factorization of sequential finite state machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automata","Integrated circuit interconnections","NP-hard problem","Logic circuits","Delay","Radio access networks","Clocks","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite automata","graph theory","logic CAD","sequential machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area optimization","performance optimization","factor identification","factor extraction","factorization","sequential finite state machines","interacting machines","logic implementation","decomposition","subroutines","factoring machine","factored machine","state-transition-graph description"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Decomposition and factorization of sequential finite state machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350233","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition and factorization of sequential finite state machines","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00122482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056098S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isNumber":"3483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"212","citationCount":"12","articleId":"122482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":122503,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

A static timing analyzer is used to identify the critical paths. Then a weighted min-cut algorithm is used to determine the subset of nodes to be resynthesized.

Resynthesis is done by selectively collapsing the logic along the critical paths and then decomposing the collapsed nodes to minimize the critical delay. This process is iterated until either the timing requirements are satisfied or no further improvement can be made. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on many design examples with promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122511","publicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/212/3483/00122511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3483","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing optimization of combinational logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing optimization of combinational logic","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122511/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing optimization of combinational logic","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00122511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033121S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isNumber":"3483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"212","citationCount":"89","articleId":"122511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":122524,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is shown that functional faults caused by opens, i.e. by regions with missing material, cannot be modeled well by a transistor stuck-open. It is also shown that the majority of opens which occur in CMOS static circuits manifest themselves as timing faults. The analysis of the behavior of a CMOS transistor with a floating gate indicates it acts as a weakly 'on' active load, and therefore an open gate cannot be detected by stuck-fault testing but could be detected by monitoring the static current through the power buses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/212/3483/00122525.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"347","publicationTitle":"[1988] IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-89) Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=122525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing oriented analysis of CMOS ICs with opens","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Semiconductor device modeling","Very large scale integration","MOSFETs","Timing","Monitoring","Fault detection","CMOS technology","Circuit analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","CMOS integrated circuits","fault location","integrated circuit testing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["testing oriented analysis","power bus static current monitoring","CMOS ICs","VLSI testing","transistor-stuck-open fault model","functional faults","missing material","static circuits","timing faults","floating gate","active load","open gate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Testing oriented analysis of CMOS ICs with opens","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3362196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing oriented analysis of CMOS ICs with opens","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00122525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050765S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 1988","isNumber":"3483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"212","citationCount":"112","articleId":"122525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":122540,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

This neural network is suitably reconfigured for solving the ATPG problem. A fault is injected into the neural network and an energy function is constructed with global minima at test vectors.

It is possible to reduce the simulation time without compromising accuracy by exploiting the fact that the behavior of such a circuit in a given high-frequency clock cycle is similar, but not identical, to its behavior in the preceding and following cycles. In particular, the envelope of the high-frequency clock can be followed by accurately computing the circuit behavior over occasional cycles.

Specifically, HAMLET accepts a sum-of-products expression from the user, applies a minimization heuristic, and then produces a PLA layout of a multiple-valued current-mode CMOS PLA. In addition to its design capabilities, HAMLET can analyze heuristics. Random functions can be generated, heuristics applied, and statistics computed on the results. User-derived expressions can also be analyzed. In addition to the minimization heuristics, HAMLET can apply search strategies based on these heuristics, which, in the extreme, are exhaustive, producing true minimal forms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/122610/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3842974","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HAMLET-an expression compiler/optimizer for the implementation of heuristics to minimize multiple-valued programmable logic arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAMLET-an expression compiler/optimizer for the implementation of heuristics to minimize multiple-valued programmable logic arrays","confLoc":"Charlotte, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00122610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038556S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1990","isNumber":"3484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"288","citationCount":"22","articleId":"122610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":122619,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The formalism solves the problem of inferring relationships between goals, which is an important problem in artificial-intelligence-based design. The focus of attention-a set of design actions which when performed move the design process in a direction consistent with the goals and their priorities-is determined on the basis of the inferred relationships and on user-specified priority orders of goals. The formalism supports an adequate tuning of both the relationships between goals and the existing design actions.

The authors present techniques to forecast schedules more accurately, to minimize risks, and to improve productivity on a continuing basis. They found that it is critical to have a specification and a resource team; otherwise, schedule slips are almost certain. They point out that during the development process, tradeoffs must be made by the ASIC designer. To do so effectively, he or she must understand the end application. Risks need assessing and contingency planning. Scheduling itself must be addressed in three senses: future (forecasts), present (monitors) and past (data). The historical database helps to forecast as well as to identify opportunities for productivity improvement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., Second Annual IEEE ASIC Seminar and Exhibit,","pdfPath":"/iel2/874/3489/00123233.pdf","startPage":"P11","endPage":"2/1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., Second Annual IEEE ASIC Seminar and Exhibit,","doi":"10.1109/ASIC.1989.123233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIC.1989.123233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC design project scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Job shop scheduling","Systems engineering and theory","Testing","Logic","Chip scale packaging","Economic forecasting","Manufacturing","Process design","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling forecast","ASIC design project scheduling","application-specific integrated circuit","development process","historical database","productivity improvement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"ASIC design project scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3677614","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC design project scheduling","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00123233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05647S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1989","isNumber":"3489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"874","citationCount":"1","articleId":"123233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":123267,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

The differential gain is found to have values higher than in corresponding bulk lasers, but only in devices with a large number of wells. The damping is also found to vary in a manner consonant with the changes in differential gain; however, comparison with bulk lasers indicates substantially stronger gain suppression in the quantum-well lasers studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.123267","startPage":"408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3490/00123267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.123267","endPage":"414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonance frequency, damping, and differential gain in 1.5 mu m multiple quantum-well lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Resonance frequency, damping, and differential gain in 1.5 mu m multiple quantum-well lasers","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4139186","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonance frequency, damping, and differential gain in 1.5 mu m multiple quantum-well lasers","sourcePdf":"00123267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067515S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"77","articleId":"123267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123268,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The first is shown to be more efficient for narrow tapers (output width <14 mu m), whereas the linear TTW-SLA becomes superior for wide-taper geometries because of its better adiabatic propagation characteristics. Both tapered structures can provide a consistent improvement in the saturation output power compared to the conventional TTW-SLA, reaching absolute values on the order of approximately 18 dBm and approximately 23 dBm for the exponential and linear TTW-SLAs, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.123272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.123272","startPage":"447","endPage":"458","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3490/00123272.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain saturation and propagation characteristics of index-guided tapered-waveguide traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers (TTW-SLAs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Gain saturation and propagation characteristics of index-guided tapered-waveguide traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers (TTW-SLAs)","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4139191","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123272/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain saturation and propagation characteristics of index-guided tapered-waveguide traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers (TTW-SLAs)","sourcePdf":"00123272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041239S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"30","articleId":"123272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":123294,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

The general systems calculus, based on divided-different operators is introduced to unify the continuous-time and discrete-time systems theories. This calculus is then used as a framework to treat the three problems of system state estimation; system identification and time-series modeling; and control system design.

A prototypical problem that is studied is that of estimating the frequencies of multiple, superimposed sinusoids from a short record of noise-corrupted data. The approach expounded however, is applicable to a vast range of nonlinear signal analysis problems and applications in direction finding and damped sinusoid retrieval are dealt with in some detail. The benefits that result from using a state space description of the signal are highlighted in this paper. It is shown that state space models provide an elegant tool for exposing the structure present in the problem. The approach also allows for robust parameterization of the model with respect to finite precision errors. The robustness of the parameter set is complemented by the availability of numerically robust tools to estimate the parameters. The resulting algorithms are compatible with multiprocessor implementations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model based processing of signals: a state space approach","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.123298","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/3491/00123298.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.123298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123298","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Model based processing of signals: a state space approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"80","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4168075","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model based processing of signals: a state space approach","sourcePdf":"00123298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069256S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"148","articleId":"123298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":123330,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

These tests include comparison of different targets, different aspect angles and frequency ranges, as well as robustness tests on the algorithm and evaluation of performance in noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4133811","displayDocTitle":"High resolution radar target modeling using a modified Prony estimator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution radar target modeling using a modified Prony estimator","sourcePdf":"00123348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035958S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"131","articleId":"123348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":123351,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Lossy conductors are replaced by surface impedance boundary conditions (SIBC), reducing the solution space and producing significant computational savings. Specifically, a SIBC is developed to replace a lossy dielectric half-space. An efficient implementation of this FDTD-SIBC based on the recursive properties of convolution with exponentials is presented. Finally, three problems are studied to illustrate the accuracy of the FDTD-SIBC formulation: a plane wave incident on a lossy dielectric half-space, a line current over a lossy dielectric half-space, and wave propagation in a parallel-plate waveguide with lossy walls.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.123351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3493/00123351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.123351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3493","startPage":"38","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of surface impedance concepts in the finite-difference time-domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The use of surface impedance concepts in the finite-difference time-domain method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4133814","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of surface impedance concepts in the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00123351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023717S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"123","articleId":"123351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123352,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The standard approach is to approximate the surface impedance over a very small bandwidth by its value at the center frequency, and then use that result in the boundary condition. In this paper, two implementations of the surface impedance boundary condition are presented. One implementation is a constant surface impedance boundary condition and the other is a dispersive surface impedance boundary condition that is applicable over a very large frequency bandwidth and over a large range of conductivities. Frequency domain results are presented in one dimension for two conductivity values and are compared with exact results. Scattering width results from an infinite square cylinder are presented as a two dimensional demonstration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain implementation of surface impedance boundary conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.123352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3493/00123352.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.123352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain implementation of surface impedance boundary conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4133815","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain implementation of surface impedance boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00123352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028713S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"135","articleId":"123352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123377,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Moveover, it can be combined with conditional Monte Carlo methods to quickly estimate transient measures such as reliability, expected interval availability, and the distribution of interval availability.

The system is based on the principle of reflectometry. Its salient characteristics include the following two features: (a) an ability to pinpoint the location of a partial discharge source not only along the cable length, but also along the surface of the trench where it is buried; and (b) the ability to operate in a high noise environment. Recent field and laboratory data obtained on noise and techniques for its mitigation are discussed in some detail.

Using the correct algorithms and parameters, the PC gains some intelligence to discriminate unknown defects. Artificial sample defects, representing sources of PD, have been implanted into a GIS system. By performing a statistical analysis of charge, energy and phase angle on the measured signals, it is possible to solve the diagnosis problem by a noise resistant software solution. The final diagnosis is carried out by pattern recognition, using a specially calculated identification data set, which is compared to reference patterns measured earlier.

The dead space is the minimum distance that a newly generated carrier must travel in order to acquire sufficient energy to become capable of causing an impact ionization. Recurrence equations are derived for the first moment, the second moment, and the probability distribution function of two random variables that are related, in a deterministic way, to the random gain of the APD. These equations are solved numerically to produce the mean gain and the excess noise factor. The presence of dead space reduces both the mean gain and the excess noise factor of the device. This may have a beneficial effect on the performance of the detector when used in optical receivers with photon noise and circuit noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of dead space on gain and noise of double-carrier-multiplication avalanche photodiodes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.123476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3498/00123476.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.123476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Effect of dead space on gain and noise of double-carrier-multiplication avalanche photodiodes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4165954","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of dead space on gain and noise of double-carrier-multiplication avalanche photodiodes","sourcePdf":"00123476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057805S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"188","articleId":"123476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123477,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This solution makes it possible to determine the time and frequency response of the device. The injection can be localized to one or both ends of the multiplication region, or distributed throughout an extended region where multiplication can occur concurrently. The results are applied to conventional APDs with position-dependent carrier ionization rates (e.g., a separate-absorption-grading-multiplication APD) as well as to superlattice multiquantum-well (MQW) structures where the ionizations are localized to bandgap transition regions. The analysis may also be used to determine the dark current and include the carrier trapping at the heterojunction interfaces. The results indicate that previous time-dependent theories only account for the tail of the time response under high-gain conditions and are inaccurate for high-speed devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.123477","startPage":"553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3498/00123477.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.123477","endPage":"560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and frequency response of avalanche photodiodes with arbitrary structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Time and frequency response of avalanche photodiodes with arbitrary structure","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4165955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time and frequency response of avalanche photodiodes with arbitrary structure","sourcePdf":"00123477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078738S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"123477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":123486,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.-S.

It was derived by modeling the gate sidewall capacitance to include the two-dimensional field-induced edge fringing effect and solving the Poisson equation to include the channel implant effect at different operating backgate biases. A two-dimensional simulation program was developed, and the simulated data were used for verification of the analytical model.

Good agreement between numerical and experimental results is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.123929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3500/00123929.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.123929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element analysis of the magnetic field in rare-earth permanent magnet systems, with consideration of temperature dependence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Magnetic fields","Magnetic properties","Electromagnetic fields","Magnetization","Permanent magnets","Temperature distribution","Performance analysis","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demagnetisation","electromagnetic fields","ferromagnetic properties of substances","finite element analysis","magnetisation","permanent magnets","rare earth alloys","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversible changes","demagnetisation curves","rare-earth permanent magnet systems","temperature dependence","finite element method","electromagnetic field","nonuniform distribution of magnetization","irreversible changes","magnetic strength","thermoelectromagnetic coupled problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Finite element analysis of the magnetic field in rare-earth permanent magnet systems, with consideration of temperature dependence","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4166152","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123929/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element analysis of the magnetic field in rare-earth permanent magnet systems, with consideration of temperature dependence","sourcePdf":"00123929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046715S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"123929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123947,"authors":[{"name":"Z.Q.

The technique is applicable to both internal and external rotor motor topologies, modeled in a cylindrical coordinate system. It can also be applied to variants of the basic motor topologies, such as those with shifted magnets (i.e. spaced unsymmetrically) or unevenly distributed stator slots, and thus it can enable design features aimed at reducing the level of cogging torque to be evaluated. Based on the proposed analytical model, the effects of varying the leading design parameters on the cogging torque can be investigated. Hence, an optimal combination of design parameters can be identified to enable low cogging torque motors to be designed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3500/00123947.pdf","startPage":"1371","endPage":"1374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.123947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.123947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical prediction of the cogging torque in radial-field permanent magnet brushless motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forging","Torque","Magnetic analysis","Stators","Topology","Brushless motors","Teeth","Rotors","Permanent magnet motors","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","rotors","stators","torque","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D solution","internal rotor","external rotor","cogging torque","radial-field permanent magnet brushless motors","airgap field distribution","net lateral force","stator teeth","cylindrical coordinate system","design features","low cogging torque motors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Analytical prediction of the cogging torque in radial-field permanent magnet brushless motors","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4166169","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical prediction of the cogging torque in radial-field permanent magnet brushless motors","sourcePdf":"00123947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059079S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"162","articleId":"123947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123950,"authors":[{"name":"Ni Guangzheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Ni Guangzheng","id":"37272750000"},{"name":"Xu Xiaoming","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xu Xiaoming","id":"37327664200"},{"name":"Cheng Weiying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Cheng Weiying","id":"38220909700"},{"name":"Li Gangru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Li Gangru","id":"38220909500"},{"name":"Jian Baidun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jian Baidun","id":"37323186900"},{"name":"Fang Zhenghu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Fang Zhenghu","id":"38220910400"},{"name":"Li Xianghua","affiliation":["Xian Transformer & Elec Furnace Works, Xi''an Electric Manufacturing Corporation, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Li Xianghua","id":"38227695900"},{"name":"Xu Jitai","affiliation":["Xian Transformer & Elec Furnace Works, Xi''an Electric Manufacturing Corporation, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Xu Jitai","id":"38220910800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"123950","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eddy currents","Harmonic analysis","Matrices","Spline","Power engineering and energy","Magnetic analysis","Coils","Reliability engineering","Eddy current testing","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","magnetic leakage","power engineering computing","power transformers","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformers","FEM analysis","3-D transformer leakage field","eddy current loss","windings","three-dimensional eddy current field","3-D time harmonic field","3-D vector potential","B-spline FEM","heat source"]}],"abstract":"The authors present a method which resolves the three-dimensional eddy current field into a 3-D time harmonic field external to the windings and n axisymmetric eddy current fields near the coils as an approximation for engineering applications.

The numerical problems associated with the thin conductors have thereby been eliminated. Results of computations on a model of the TOSKA Upgrade test facility are presented. The aluminium radiation shields are not in danger; the stresses acting upon them are negligible. This is due to their being located relatively far from the superconducting coil. Only parts of the supply lines near the connecting flange of the vacuum vessel experience considerable stress. Their reinforcement under rapid changes may be necessary. The vacuum vessel is not endangered, since its wall of 20 mm thickness easily withstands the stresses due to the induced eddy currents. Normal pressures of up to about 50 t/m/sup 2/ occur at the LN2 shield. This makes modifications of its structure necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3500/00123983.pdf","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.123983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.123983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=123983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM calculation of eddy current losses and forces in thin conducting sheets of test facilities for fusion reactor components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eddy currents","Stress","Magnetic shielding","Finite element methods","Couplings","Superconducting magnets","Conductors","Computational modeling","Test facilities","Aluminum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","fusion reactor safety","fusion reactor theory and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM calculation","eddy current losses","thin conducting sheets","test facilities","fusion reactor components","magnetic field","gauged magnetic vector potential","TOSKA Upgrade test facility","superconducting coil","supply lines","LN2 shield"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"FEM calculation of eddy current losses and forces in thin conducting sheets of test facilities for fusion reactor components","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180251","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM calculation of eddy current losses and forces in thin conducting sheets of test facilities for fusion reactor components","sourcePdf":"00123983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066317S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","articleId":"123983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":123989,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Han Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Il-Han Park","id":"37361465700"},{"name":"Beom-Taek Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Beom-Taek Lee","id":"38226590000"},{"name":"Song-Yop Hahn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Song-Yop Hahn","id":"37269017200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"123989","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"The authors present a sensitivity analysis for the shape design problems of a two-dimensional nonlinear magnetostatic system.

The coefficient matrices of the different subregions are assembled separately and reduced only to those degrees of freedom that are associated with the nodes at subregion interfaces. The reduced matrices of all subregions are used to assemble the final global matrix, which is solved for the reduced system. It is in this repeated analysis of similar field problems that the subregion method is applied with significant computational savings: in synthesis only those subregions that enclose changes in the design have to be assembled and reduced for the modified design. Thus, the computational effort for reanalysis is reduced to the area of design modifications. The subregion approach is successfully applied to the procedure of device synthesis, where a large number of field computations is required in the iterative search for the optimal design. The subregion method is extended to the calculation of the potential gradient directly from the finite element equations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.123996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3500/00123996.pdf","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1564","doi":"10.1109/20.123996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The subregion method in magnetic field analysis and design optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"The subregion method in magnetic field analysis and design optimization","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180264","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/123996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The subregion method in magnetic field analysis and design optimization","sourcePdf":"00123996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027523S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"25","articleId":"123996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":124016,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The finite element formulation using tetrahedral edge elements in terms of electric field is employed in the conducting region.

The use of a vector variable in the air space together with a boundary spanning tree technique makes it possible to solve multiply connected problems and leads to a diminution of boundary unknowns. The electric and the magnetic variables are coupled on the boundary of the domain through the boundary continuity of electric and magnetic fields; the coupling matrices thus obtained are the transposes of one another.

TSC measurements at negative bias following positive-bias irradiation provide useful estimates of the net oxide-trap charge, Delta G/sub ot/, if the TSC bias is large enough to overcome trapped-hole space-charge effects. Very little TSC is observed for positive-bias irradiation. Under proper TSC bias conditions, TSC and C-V estimates of Delta G/sub ot/ agree well for thick, soft oxides, but differ significantly for thin, hard oxides. Differences between TSC and C-V estimates of Delta G/sub ot/ for thin, hard oxides are attributed to electron injection into the oxide and capture at trap sites associated with the radiation-induced trapped holes. It is shown that TSC measurements can provide insight into the location of hole traps in MOS oxides that cannot be obtained from standard C-V tests.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","volume":"38","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4123191","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of bias on thermally stimulated current (TSC) in irradiated MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of bias on thermally stimulated current (TSC) in irradiated MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00124076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067455S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"73","articleId":"124076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":124077,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Device-level simulation is used to estimate the probability that ion-device interactions produce erroneous signals capable of propagating to a latch (or an output node), and logic-level simulation to predict the spread of such erroneous, latched information through the IC. Simulation results are compared to those from SPICE for several circuit and logic configurations. SITA results are comparable to this established circuit-level code, and SITA can analyze circuits with state-of-the-art device densities (which SPICE cannot).

To aid this effort, the authors have developed a wafer-level test system to map test-structure and IC response across a wafer. This system permits current-voltage and charge-pumping measurements on transistors, and high-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements on capacitors. For frequencies up to 50 MHz, the system provides a complete menu of functional and parametric IC tests. Wafer maps and histograms of test-structure and IC response are presented for a 1.2- mu m radiation-hardened CMOS technology to illustrate the capabilities of the wafer-level test system. Statistical and deterministic approaches to correlate test structure and IC response are discussed for this technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.124151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1598","endPage":"1605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3501/00124151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.124151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wafer-level radiation testing for hardness assurance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit testing","System testing","CMOS technology","Capacitance measurement","Current measurement","Manufacturing processes","Process control","Charge pumps","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","production testing","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardness assurance","qualified manufacturers list","technology parameters","radiation hardness","statistical process control","wafer-level test system","charge-pumping measurements","high-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements","parametric IC tests","radiation-hardened CMOS technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Wafer-level radiation testing for hardness assurance","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4114212","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124151/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wafer-level radiation testing for hardness assurance","sourcePdf":"00124151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053478S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"34","articleId":"124151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124153,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The IDM is flying on the combined release and radiation effects satellite (CRRES). The sixteen insulator samples include G10 circuit boards, FR4 and PTFE fiberglass circuit boards, FEP Teflon, alumina, and wires with common insulations. The samples are fully enclosed, mutually isolated, and space radiation penetrates 0.02 cm of aluminum before striking the samples. The IDM results indicate the rate at which insulator pulses occur. Pulsing began on the seventh orbit. The maximum pulse rate occurred near orbit 600 when over 50 pulses occurred. The average pulse rate is approximately two per orbit, but nearly half of the first 600 orbits experienced no pulses. The pulse rate per unit flux of high energy electrons has not changed dramatically over the first ten months in space. These pulse rates are in agreement with laboratory experience on shorter time scales. Several of the samples have never pulsed. IDM pulses are the seeds of larger satellite electrical anomalies. The pulse rates are compared with space radiation intensities, L shell location, and spectral distributions from the radiation spectrometers on CRRES.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.124153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3501/00124153.pdf","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1621","doi":"10.1109/23.124153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation-induced insulator discharge pulses in the CRRES internal discharge monitor satellite experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-induced insulator discharge pulses in the CRRES internal discharge monitor satellite experiment","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4114214","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-induced insulator discharge pulses in the CRRES internal discharge monitor satellite experiment","sourcePdf":"00124153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035099S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","articleId":"124153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":124159,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Up to the time of the large, solar-initiated particle events near the end of March 1991, the results are similar to those previously reported for solar minimum at low altitudes. That is, prior to the March event, there is excellent agreement between model and measured values for protons and poor agreement for electrons. During the event period a second proton belt was formed at higher altitudes which is not contained in the proton models, and the electrons increased over an order of magnitude for the CRRES orbit. This resulted in poorer agreement between model and measured values for protons during and after the solar proton event and better agreement for electrons during the electron enhancement period. What the data show is that, depending on orbit, both the existing proton and electron models can give large errors in dose that can compromise space system performance and lifetime.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","volume":"38","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4114220","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary comparison of dose measurements on CRRES to NASA model predictions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary comparison of dose measurements on CRRES to NASA model predictions","sourcePdf":"00124159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06286S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","articleId":"124159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":124165,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The model further predicts that overflight times near 2:00 AM/PM would be nearly optimal for RTI, that midnight/noon and 4:00 AM/PM are nearly as good, but that the 6:00 AM/PM overflight times of the current SSM/I are particularly poor.

The fields are formulated in integral form under the thin-wire approximation. The discrete mode propagation constants for the insulated and bare cable types have dramatically different behavior, and subsequently affect the radiated fields. Unlike the insulated cable, it is shown that for the bare conductor the accurate determination of the propagation constant is imperative in the calculation of some of the field quantities at the Earth's surface. Simple near-field expressions are developed from the integral forms and numerical results are presented for various cable structures and burial depths. The study implies that the use of various commonly utilized approximations, such as the uniform axial current assumption, may not be valid for the bare or grounded buried conductors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","volume":"30","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4129770","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fields generated by bare and insulated cables buried in a lossy half-space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fields generated by bare and insulated cables buried in a lossy half-space","sourcePdf":"00124224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060125S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"27","articleId":"124224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124226,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Experimental data are compared against theoretical predictions obtained by two different models. In a simple and direct approach, vegetation is considered as a uniform absorbing and scattering slab with plane parallel boundaries, while in a more realistic description, plants are modeled as an ensemble of lossy dielectric disks and thin cylinders (needles). A parametric analysis, carried out to assess the sensitivity of the polarization index (PI) to the most significant parameters of vegetation shows that, although the PI is mainly influenced by global parameters such as leaf area index and plant water content, morphological parameters such as disk or needle dimensions and orientation distribution may play a relevant role. In particular, a model composed of a mixture of disks and needles is able to represent the negative value of PI sometimes measured over fully grown vegetation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","volume":"30","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4129772","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling polarization properties of emission from soil covered with vegetation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling polarization properties of emission from soil covered with vegetation","sourcePdf":"00124226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043535S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","articleId":"124226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":124231,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In some applications, such as transform source coders, it is important that the cascade of the forward and the inverse transform give the identity exactly (perfect inversion), although the coefficients and the intermediate results are quantized. In subband coders, for example, the split and merge filter banks should preferably have perfect reconstruction. It is advantageous if perfect reconstruction can be accomplished even when the coefficients and the intermediate results are quantized. The proposed network has a ladderlike shape and a predescribed symmetry between the forward and inverse network or between the split and merge bank. In some parts of this ladder network almost any function is allowed. Due to the prescribed symmetry, the property of perfect inversion or perfect reconstruction is structurally assured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3512/00124464.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.124464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.124464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New networks for perfect inversion and perfect reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Filter bank","Transform coding","Discrete transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Shape","Delay","Tail","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","encoding","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward transform","forward network","transform coding","filter coefficients","network structure","perfect inversion networks","perfect reconstruction networks","transform source coders","inverse transform","subband coders","split and merge filter banks","inverse network","ladder network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"New networks for perfect inversion and perfect reconstruction","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4129102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New networks for perfect inversion and perfect reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00124464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034027S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"88","articleId":"124464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124467,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

To perform MLSD at the high data rates encountered in recording systems, a simple implementation of the Viterbi detector based on a difference-metric algorithm is developed. Decision-directed schemes for gain control and timing recovery, for tracking variations of the gain and timing phase during data readback, and for fast initial adjustment from a known preamble are presented. The dynamic behavior of the control algorithms was studied by computer simulations. Coding was used to facilitate timing recovery and gain control, to limit the path memory length of the Viterbi detector, and to allow fast and reliable startup of the receiver. The design and properties of rate 8/9 constrained codes are examined. The problem of equalization is addressed, and analog and combined analog/digital filter implementations are developed. A simple adaptive equalizer capable of compensating variations of the recording channel characteristics with track radius and/or head-to-medium distance is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.124468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3512/00124468.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.124468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PRML system for digital magnetic recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"A PRML system for digital magnetic recording","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4129095","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PRML system for digital magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00124468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049967S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"228","articleId":"124468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124473,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An audio signal with a 20 kHz bandwidth sampled at 48 kHz is coded at a rate of 128 kb/s. The algorithm utilizes adaptive block size selection, which is effective for preecho suppression. A modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) with a simple window set is employed to reduce block boundary noise without decreasing the performance of transform coding. In addition, a fast MDCT calculation algorithm, based on a fast Fourier transform, is adopted. Weighted bit allocation is employed to quantize the transformed coefficients. The codec was realized by a multiprocessor system composed of newly developed DSP boards.

The superposition channel with additive Gaussian noise is used as a model for recording. This model says that for a saturation input signal, x(t) (i.e., one that can assume only one of two levels), the output can be expressed as y(t)=x(t)+z(t) where x(t) is a filtered version of the input x(t) and z(t) is additive Gaussian noise. The channel is described by the impulse response of the channel filter, h(t), and by the autocorrelation function of the noise. A specific example of such a channel is the differentiated Lorentz channel. Certain autocorrelation and spectrum expressions for a general Lorentz channel are derived. Upper and lower bounds on the capacity of saturation recording channels are described. The bounds are explicitly computed for the differentiated Lorentz channel model.

The analysis revolves around the power spectral density A( Omega ) of the code and the folded signal-to-noise ratio X( Omega ) of the channel. The latter function is analyzed for stylized optical and magnetic recording channels. For all equalizers it is shown that the effect of coding is similar to increasing X( Omega ) by an additive portion 1/A( Omega ). This favors depressions of A( Omega ) at frequencies where X( Omega ) is poor. However, for A( Omega ) to have any depressions, the signaling rate must be increased with respect to uncoded storage, and this inevitably degrades X( Omega ). At high information densities the degradation is often too large for coding to be rewarding.

Although the BDFE with the trellis code system does not perform as well as the DFE with CC system at high densities, it does produce substantial coding gains at low linear recording densities.<<ETX>>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.124476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3512/00124476.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"181","doi":"10.1109/49.124476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined equalization and coding for high-density saturation recording channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Combined equalization and coding for high-density saturation recording channels","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4129106","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined equalization and coding for high-density saturation recording channels","sourcePdf":"00124476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038006S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"124476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124477,"authors":[{"name":"R.

From these expressions, trellis codes are derived which improve performance of binary signaling over noisy PR channels with reduced complexity maximum-likelihood sequence detection. They are shown to be compatible with the input restriction caused by the magnetooptical resonant coil direct overwrite recording scheme. The codes achieve high signal-to-noise ratio coding gains of 3 dB (on PR class I) and 2.2 dB (on PR class II) with rates as close to, but strictly less than, the capacity of the initial input restriction as desired. The performance of these codes is analyzed with an optical channel simulation system which shows that one code has the rare but highly desirable property that its maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) is less complex than the MLSD of the reference system and still achieves an error rate performance gain of 1.8 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4129107","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trellis codes for partial-response magnetooptical direct overwrite recording","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis codes for partial-response magnetooptical direct overwrite recording","sourcePdf":"00124477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032533S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","articleId":"124477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":124479,"authors":[{"name":"M.-K.

It is shown that for certain sync patterns, called repetitive-free sync patterns, the capacity can be formulated in a simple manner as it is solely a function of the (d, k) parameters and the length of the sync pattern.

The design process consisted of two parts. A nominal model of the disk drive characteristics in the time and frequency domains was obtained from digitized waveforms at the output of a read-head amplifier in a disk drive system. The relative performance of candidate equalizers was studied by subjecting them to the measured data waveforms and then either estimating or measuring the resulting bit error rate in a simulated peak detector, operating on the equalized waveforms. The equalizer outperforms more complex structures proposed for this task and is well suited for implementation as an analog CMOS active filter with low power dissipation.

A transmission experiment at 3.5 Mb/s reveals that about 4 dB of improvement in receiver sensitivity can be obtained by using a laser preamplifier at I=0.54 I/sub th/ when compared to an unbiased laser. The receiver sensitivity of the proposed configuration (laser amplifier at low bias current and photodiode) is estimated by considering the laser preamplifier noise and circuit noise.

The model accounts for the influence of an optical bandlimiting filter as well as of a polarization filter. Effects of laser phase noise, of spontaneous emission noise from the amplifier, and of shot noise and thermal noise in the receiver front end are accounted for. The predicted phase noise penalty for a single channel configuration is found. For multichannel system design, it is found that a system with many optical channels and no phase noise should have a channel separation of 9.4 bit rates to have less than 1-dB worst-case crosstalk penalty. For a linewidth of 27% of the bit rate in each channel the required spacing increases to 25 bit rates or more.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Optical noise","Optical filters","Phase noise","Optical receivers","Stimulated emission","Optical crosstalk","Bit rate","Optical detectors","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","electron device noise","optical communication equipment","optical filters","optical links","preamplifiers","receivers","semiconductor junction lasers","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system sensitivity","multichannel system design","optical preamplifiers","amplifier noise","receiver noise","multichannel direct detection systems","optical preamplification","optical bandlimiting filter","polarization filter","laser phase noise","spontaneous emission noise","shot noise","thermal noise","receiver front end","phase noise penalty","single channel configuration","optical channels","channel separation","worst-case crosstalk penalty"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.124500","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3513/00124500.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.124500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel system design using optical preamplifiers and accounting for the effects of phase noise, amplifier noise, and receiver noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel system design using optical preamplifiers and accounting for the effects of phase noise, amplifier noise, and receiver noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124500/","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4161734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel system design using optical preamplifiers and accounting for the effects of phase noise, amplifier noise, and receiver noise","sourcePdf":"00124500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039278S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","articleId":"124500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124513,"authors":[{"name":"B.A.A.

It is demonstrated how continuous elimination of harmonics is achieved at the inverter output while simultaneously rejecting the DC-link voltage ripple. Thus, with the proposed technique, high-quality voltage is guaranteed at the inverter output terminals even with a substantial low-frequency voltage ripple on the DC-link. A thorough modeling of this technique along with the tradeoffs involved in acquiring the immunity to DC-link ripple is illustrated in detail. Potential applications of the technique are in fixed and variable frequency inverters for power supplies and AC motor drives that experience voltage ripple in the DC link such as when fed from a weak AC system that is frequently unbalanced. A design procedure along with the digital implementation of the proposed technique is described.

However, theoretically optimum PWM strategies are often difficult to implement physically or are not easily extended to regenerative operation. The authors propose an alternative PWM strategy based on AC-AC matrix converter theory, which generates only high-order switching harmonics, presents a unity power factor load to the supply, implicitly extends to regeneration (and operation with a center tapped DC output), and is feasible to physically implement for real-time output voltage control. Both the theory and physical simulation results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a controlled rectifier using AC-AC matrix converter theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.124596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/3516/00124596.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.124596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a controlled rectifier using AC-AC matrix converter theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4147037","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a controlled rectifier using AC-AC matrix converter theory","sourcePdf":"00124596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033422S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"137","articleId":"124596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124612,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

Prototyping amplifiers with three design techniques have been fabricated by the MOSIS service using a 2- mu m scalable CMOS technology. Experimental results show a significant speed-up on amplifier transient responses. The dynamic biasing technique is used to enhance the slew rate by increasing the bias current of the input differential pair when the differential-mode input voltage is large. Another differential pair is added to sense the input voltage. The additional circuitry increases the input capacitance of an MOS amplifier, which can degrade power supply rejection ratio characteristics. Since the slew rate enhancement factor is proportional to the ratio of bias current and additional dynamic biasing current, a large improvement on slew rate always generates additional ripples on the power lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1990.124689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/140/3519/00124689.pdf","startPage":"8.4/1","endPage":"8.4/4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1990.124689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed CMOS amplifier with dynamic frequency compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124689/","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed CMOS amplifier with dynamic frequency compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875323","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed CMOS amplifier with dynamic frequency compensation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00124689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03152S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1990","isNumber":"3519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"140","citationCount":"7","articleId":"124689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":124691,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The MARS hardware simulator is a mixed-mode logic-behavior-memory simulator applicable to the design of both custom and semicustom integrated circuits. It is particularly suited for the simulation of ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The major benefit of this simulator is the reduced element count compared to simulators that make use of four-input primitives. Most of the reduction is due to flip-flops, buffers and high-speed combinational elements. The evaluation time per element will be increased by 20-50%, depending on the element type. However, the total simulation time will be shorter because of the reduced element count. Race analysis, setup, and hold time violations can be detected by monitoring the clock and data inputs during simulation and postprocessing the simulation results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/140/3519/00124696.pdf","startPage":"9.2/1","endPage":"9.2/4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1990.124696","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1990.124696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed behavior-logic simulation in a hardware accelerator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mixed behavior-logic simulation in a hardware accelerator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124696/","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875329","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed behavior-logic simulation in a hardware accelerator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00124696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039334S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1990","isNumber":"3519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"140","citationCount":"1","articleId":"124696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":124699,"authors":[{"name":"D.

To find the input or input sequence that maximizes the weighted activity, algorithms are given for transforming the problem to a weighted max-satisfiability problem, and then exact and approximate algorithms for solving weighted max-satisfiability are given. That is, transformations are presented that convert a logic description into a multiple-output Boolean function of the input vector or vector sequence, where each output of the Boolean function is associated with a logic gate output transition. Algorithms for constructing the Boolean function for dynamic CMOS and static CMOS, which take into account dissipation due to glitching, are presented.

It is shown that an initial stage of filter-bank analysis is effective for achieving noise robustness. The technique is compared with currently popular spectral analysis techniques based on singular value decomposition and is found to provide generally better resolution and lower variance at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). These techniques, along with three established methods and three variations of these method, are further evaluated for their effectiveness for formant frequency estimation of noise corrupted speech. The theoretical results predict and experimental results confirm that the zero-crossing method performs well for estimating low frequencies and hence for first formant frequency estimation in speech at high noise levels ( approximately 0 dB SNR). Otherwise, J.A. Cadzow's high performance method (1983) is found to be a close alternative for reliable spectral estimation. As expected the overall performance of all techniques is found to degrade for speech data. The standard autocorrelation-LPC method is found best for clean speech and all methods deteriorate roughly equally in noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-crossing based spectral analysis and SVD spectral analysis for formant frequency estimation in noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.124939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3524/00124939.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.124939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Zero-crossing based spectral analysis and SVD spectral analysis for formant frequency estimation in noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4141868","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-crossing based spectral analysis and SVD spectral analysis for formant frequency estimation in noise","sourcePdf":"00124939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048265S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","articleId":"124939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124941,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is shown that four existing techniques all fit into a general methodology for vector quantizer design aimed at finding a globally optimal solution. Comparisons of the algorithms' performances when quantizing Gauss-Markov processes, speech, and image sources are given. The SA method is guaranteed to perform in a globally optimal manner, and the SR technique gives empirical results equivalent to those of SA.

A procedure for linear phase digital filter design, using this algorithm, is presented and tested, yielding results as good as those for known optimal methods. The algorithm is then applied to the design of Nyquist filters, optimizing at the same time both frequency response and intersymbol interference, and to the design of cascade form finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters. The drawback of using SA is that the computation time is on the order of 1-2 h for each filter design, on the Sun 3/60. However, this was more than compensated by the versatility of the new algorithm, which can be used to design filters with multiple constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of simulated annealing for the design of special digital filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.124942","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3524/00124942.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.124942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=124942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Applications of simulated annealing for the design of special digital filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4141871","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of simulated annealing for the design of special digital filters","sourcePdf":"00124942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075267S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"121","articleId":"124942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":124943,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

Four alternative approaches of complex direct-form and coupled-form oscillator structures are discussed leading to a multiple-output direct-form oscillator as the best solution from the viewpoint of computational efficiency. Two inherent advantages of direct-form structures can be avoided by appropriate means. The problem of poor frequency resolution at low frequencies is solved by a method called two's complement improvement (TCI). An oscillator frequency displacement is discovered which is caused by correlation between one state variable and the quantization error using finite arithmetic. This frequency error can be substantially reduced by appropriate error noise shaping. Some telecommunication applications like fixed-frequency complex oscillators for baseband signal processing, complex baseband frequency shift keying (FSK) modulators, and multiple-phase oscillators for multipath filters are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.124943","startPage":"333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3524/00124943.pdf","endPage":"342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.124943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124943/","displayDocTitle":"Complex digital oscillators and FSK modulators","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4141872","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex digital oscillators and FSK modulators","sourcePdf":"00124943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028643S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","articleId":"124943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124944,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

Since techniques like spatial and weighted smoothing, which were developed for decorrelating the signals, suffer from reduced effective aperture, several authors have recently proposed redundancy averaging as an alternative spatial averaging method. Considering a two-source signal model and the asymptotic case, the authors show analytically that this technique results in an eigenstructure which is inconsistent with that of the underlying signal model. In particular, the resulting signal subspace fills up the whole M-dimensional space, where M is the array size, and the resulting covariance matrix is not guaranteed to be nonnegative definite. It is shown that complete decorrelation is not possible with this method even if the array size is infinitely large.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Covariance matrix","Decorrelation","Sensor arrays","Array signal processing","Smoothing methods","Degradation","Apertures","Signal analysis","Aging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","redundancy","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array processing","DOA estimation","linear sensor array","redundancy averaging","direction-of-arrival estimation","beamforming","correlated signals","spatial averaging method","two-source signal model","eigenstructure","signal subspace","M-dimensional space","covariance matrix","decorrelation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.124962","startPage":"466","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3524/00124962.pdf","doi":"10.1109/78.124962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A note on redundancy averaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","displayDocTitle":"A note on redundancy averaging","accessionNumber":"4141891","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A note on redundancy averaging","sourcePdf":"00124962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024591S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","articleId":"124962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":124963,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

The dynamical memory function was demonstrated by locking second order bifurcated modes to external clock oscillations and performing WRITE and READ of binary data sequences in the waveforms of the bifurcated modes. The nonlinear bifurcation phenomena in this system are applicable for large-capacity memory and signal processing. Spurious preferential excitation of particular harmonic modes was related to the fine structure in the transfer spectrum of the open loop associated with spurious resonances in the electrooptical modulator used as a nonlinear element.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.124994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"686","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3525/00124994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.124994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillation modes of laser diode pumped hybrid bistable system with large delay and application to dynamical memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diode lasers","Laser excitation","Delay systems","Bifurcation","Delay effects","Stability","Switches","Optical bistability","Chaotic communication","Optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical devices","optical bistability","optical pumping","optical storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["write","read","laser diode pumped hybrid bistable system","electrooptical bistable system","self-oscillation phenomena","multistable self-oscillation modes","second-order bifurcations","dynamical memory function","second order bifurcated modes","external clock oscillations","binary data sequences","nonlinear bifurcation phenomena","large-capacity memory","signal processing","electrooptical modulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Oscillation modes of laser diode pumped hybrid bistable system with large delay and application to dynamical memory","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4146352","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/124994/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillation modes of laser diode pumped hybrid bistable system with large delay and application to dynamical memory","sourcePdf":"00124994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084288S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"58","articleId":"124994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":124997,"authors":[{"name":"M.

They evaluated the effect of tapered bolus chambers, frequency (100-120 MHz), dipole length (17-30 cm), and phase and amplitude of power to the various dipoles on the ability to focus energy in the region of deep-seated tumors in the prostate and the liver. Assuming tumor conductivity and permittivity to be similar or slightly higher than surrounding normal tissues, calculations indicate that adjustment of the noted parameters should result in considerable improvement in focusing of SAR distributions in tumor-bearing regions. If such calculations can be shown to correctly predict empirical measurements from complex inhomogeneous (although not necessarily anatomically correct) phantoms, they may be useful for hyperthermia treatment planning based on patient-specific anatomic models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.125005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3526/00125005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.125005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical simulation of annular-phased arrays of dipoles for hyperthermia of deep-seated tumors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical simulation","Hyperthermia","Finite difference methods","Liver neoplasms","Time domain analysis","Specific absorption rate","Antenna arrays","Dipole antennas","Biological system modeling","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biothermics","physiological models","radiation therapy","radiofrequency heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference-time-domain method","numerical simulation","complex inhomogeneous phantoms","specific absorption rate distribution","water bolus","tumor permittivity","3D models","annular-phased arrays","dipoles","hyperthermia","deep-seated tumors","human body","tapered bolus chambers","prostate","liver","tumor conductivity","patient-specific anatomic models","100 to 120 MHz","17 to 30 cm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Hyperthermia, Induced","Liver Neoplasms","Male","Models, Anatomic","Models, Biological","Models, Structural","Prostatic Neoplasms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Numerical simulation of annular-phased arrays of dipoles for hyperthermia of deep-seated tumors","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4151170","pubMedId":"1555850","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125005/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical simulation of annular-phased arrays of dipoles for hyperthermia of deep-seated tumors","sourcePdf":"00125005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052432S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"44","articleId":"125005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":125014,"authors":[{"name":"E.V.

JPEG's proposed standard aims to be generic, to support a wide variety of applications for continuous-tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT (discrete cosine transform)-based method is specified for 'lossy' compression, and a predictive method for 'lossless' compression. JPEG features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented JPEG method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications. The author provides an overview of the JPEG standard, and focuses in detail on the Baseline method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.125072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.125072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/3528/00125072.pdf","startPage":"xviii","endPage":"xxxiv","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The JPEG still picture compression standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"The JPEG still picture compression standard","volume":"38","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4180430","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125072/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The JPEG still picture compression standard","sourcePdf":"00125072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027438S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1139","articleId":"125072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":125078,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

The problem is to route the given interconnections between two rows of terminals on a multilayer channel where the channel area must be minimized. The current advancement of VLSI chip technology allows one to use four layers composed of two metal layers and two polysilicon layers for routing in a chip. The goal of the proposed parallel algorithm is to find the near-optimum routing solution for the given interconnections in a short time. The algorithm is applied to four-layer channel routing problems requiring n*m*2 processing elements for the n-net-m-track problem. The algorithm has three advantages over the conventional algorithms: (1) it can be easily modified for accommodating more than four-layer problems; (2) it runs both on a sequential machine and on a parallel machine with maximally n*m*2 processors; and (3) the program size is very small. The algorithm is verified by solving seven bench-mark problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.125094","startPage":"464","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.125094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3529/00125094.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel algorithm for channel routing problems (VLSI)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125094/","displayDocTitle":"A parallel algorithm for channel routing problems (VLSI)","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4161324","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel algorithm for channel routing problems (VLSI)","sourcePdf":"00125094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140456S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","articleId":"125094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":125100,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

The algorithm can be implemented on analog hardware, using a four-layer binary feedforward neural network (BFNN). The BLTA does not constitute a traditional circuit building technique. Indeed, the rules which govern the BLTA allow for generalization of data in the face of incompletely specified Boolean functions. When compared with techniques which employ descent methods, training times are greatly reduced in the case of the BLTA. Also, when the BFNN is used in conjunction with A/D converters, the applicability of the present algorithm can be extended to accept real-valued inputs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4119744","pubMedId":"18276419","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A training algorithm for binary feedforward neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A training algorithm for binary feedforward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00125859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048056S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"80","articleId":"125859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":125860,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The conventional backpropagation algorithm cannot be applied in this case because the required derivatives are not available. However, if the network weights are random variables with smooth distribution functions, the probability of a hard-limiting unit taking one of its two possible values is a continuously differentiable function. In the paper, this is used to develop an algorithm similar to backpropagation, but for the hard-limiting case. It is shown that the computational framework of this algorithm is similar to standard backpropagation, but there is an additional computational expense involved in the estimation of gradients. Upper bounds on this estimation penalty are given. Two examples which indicate that, when this algorithm is used to train networks of hard-limiting units, its performance is similar to that of conventional backpropagation applied to networks of units with sigmoidal characteristics are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3532/00125861.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.125861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.125861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=125861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using random weights to train multilayer networks of hard-limiting units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Random variables","Distribution functions","Computational modeling","Upper bound","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Hardware","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","random weights","multilayer networks","hard-limiting units","gradient descent algorithm","training","estimation penalty","sigmoidal characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Using random weights to train multilayer networks of hard-limiting units","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4119746","pubMedId":"18276421","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using random weights to train multilayer networks of hard-limiting units","sourcePdf":"00125861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029461S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"28","articleId":"125861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":125862,"authors":[{"name":"S.-G.

The supervised backpropagation learning algorithm trained the neural network systems. The robustness of the neural systems was tested by removing random subsets of training data in learning sequences. The neural systems performed well but required extensive computation for training. The fuzzy systems performed well until over 50% of their fuzzy-associative-memory (FAM) rules were removed. They also performed well when the key FAM equilibration rule was replaced with destructive, or 'sabotage', rules. Unsupervised differential competitive learning (DCL) and product-space clustering adaptively generated FAM rules from training data. The original fuzzy control systems and neural control systems generated trajectory data. The DCL system rapidly recovered the underlying FAM rules. Product-space clustering converted the neural truck systems into structured sets of FAM rules that approximated the neural system's behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.125862","startPage":"211","endPage":"223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3532/00125862.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.125862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy systems for backing up a truck-and-trailer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy control","Training data","Control system synthesis","Computational modeling","Backpropagation algorithms","Neural networks","Robustness","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","computerised control","digital simulation","fuzzy logic","learning systems","neural nets","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised differential competitive learning","adaptive fuzzy systems","backing up","truck-and-trailer","neural-network control systems","simulated truck","loading dock","parking lot","supervised backpropagation learning algorithm","robustness","fuzzy-associative-memory","equilibration rule","product-space clustering","fuzzy control systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy systems for backing up a truck-and-trailer","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4119747","pubMedId":"18276422","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy systems for backing up a truck-and-trailer","sourcePdf":"00125862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038809S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"211","articleId":"125862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":125863,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This simple configuration includes the difficulty of teaching the network. In addition, it is preferable to let the network learn so that a global and arbitrary evaluation of the total responses of the plant will be optimized eventually. In order to satisfy these needs, genetic algorithms are modified to accommodate the network learning procedure. This procedure is a kind of simulated evolution process in which a group of networks gradually improves as a whole, by crossing over connection weights among them, or by mutational changes of the weights, according to fitness values assigned to each network by a global evaluation. Simulations demonstrate that these networks can be optimized in terms of various evaluations, and they can discover schemes by themselves, such as state estimation and nonlinear control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4119748","pubMedId":"18276423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Neural network application for direct feedback controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network application for direct feedback controllers","sourcePdf":"00125863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038644S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"108","articleId":"125863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":125864,"authors":[{"name":"E.

That is, rather than training a controller network and placing this network directly in the feedback or feedforward paths, the forward model of the plant is learned, and iterative inversion is performed on line to generate control commands. The control approach allows the controllers to respond online to changes in the plant dynamics. This approach also attempts to avoid the difficulty of analysis introduced by most current neural network controllers, which place the highly nonlinear neural network directly in the feedback path. A neural network-based model reference adaptive controller is also proposed for systems having significant dynamics between the control inputs and the observed (or desired) outputs and is demonstrated on a simple linear control system.

They present the novel techniques used in the application of genetic algorithms. First, the genetic algorithm is configured to use an approximate evaluation in order to reduce significantly the computation required. In particular, though the desired classifiers are counterpropagation networks, they use a nearest-neighbor classifier to evaluate features sets and show that the features selected by this method are effective in the context of counterpropagation networks. Second, a method called the training set sampling in which only a portion of the training set is used on any given evaluation, is proposed. Computational savings can be made using this method, i.e., evaluations can be made over an order of magnitude faster. This method selects feature sets that are as good as and occasionally better for counterpropagation than those chosen by an evaluation that uses the entire training set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3532/00125874.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"328","doi":"10.1109/72.125874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.125874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast generic selection of features for neural network classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Fast generic selection of features for neural network classifiers","publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4119759","pubMedId":"18276434","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast generic selection of features for neural network classifiers","sourcePdf":"00125874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027788S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"148","articleId":"125874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":125884,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

A full-wave analysis technique has resulted in an integrated antenna with performance comparable to that of waveguide-fed corrugated-horn antennas. The integrated horn design can be extended to large arrays, for imaging and phased-array applications, while leaving plenty of room for the RF and IF processing circuitry.

Three sets of the unit are held by an elastic frame. The sensor, in comparison with the conventional strain-gauge-based device, is more compact, light in weight, low in cost, and accurate. The high accuracy of the sensor comes from the calibration method in which nonlinear interferences of six-axial force are considered. An experimental setup in which the six-axial force sensor could be simultaneously input with plural axial forces was produced, and the proposed calibration method was shown to be valid.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.125944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.125944","startPage":"46","endPage":"53 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00125944.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of optical six-axial force sensor and its signal calibration considering nonlinear interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Development of optical six-axial force sensor and its signal calibration considering nonlinear interference","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3875293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/125944/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of optical six-axial force sensor and its signal calibration considering nonlinear interference","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00125944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023794S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"52","articleId":"125944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":125948,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The approach is based on modulating the velocity feedback gain based on a model of the manipulator inertia and the desired stiffness. By using different stiffness gains, different dynamic damping laws can be obtained. In particular, joint space, gripper space, and constant bandwidth versions have been developed. Simulations have been used to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of using dynamic damping control laws over conventional computed torque and proportional-derivative (PD) control laws. The disadvantages are greater computational requirements and greater coupling of joints. The advantages are guaranteed stability, greater bandwidth for small inertias, and more effective utilization of torque.

The dynamic performance of such a system in constrained situations is very dependent on the environmental parameters. An adaptive controlled based on the model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) approach is developed for a single-axis manipulator model and is further extended to the multiaxis case using the concept of directional adaptation: the MRAC and the compliance are active only in the direction of the force constraints, thus allowing near-perfect velocity and force tracking in all directions. Simulation results show that the adaptive scheme can significantly improve the performance in force tracking and enhance stability at high stiffness by rendering the behavior independent of the environment and robot parameters.

The stability of the rule is proved through the use of a Liapunov function. Inputs to the vehicle are a reference posture (x/sub r/, y/sub r/, theta /sub r/)/sup t/ and reference velocities ( nu /sub r/, omega /sub r/)/sup t/. The major objective of this study is to propose a control rule to find reasonable target linear and rotational velocities ( nu , omega )/sup t/. Linearizing the system's differential equation is useful for deciding parameters for critical dumping for a small disturbance. In order to avoid slippage, a velocity/acceleration limitation scheme is introduced. Several simulation results are presented with or without the velocity/acceleration limiter. The control rule and limiting method proposed are robot independent and hence can be applied to various kinds of mobile robots with a dead reckoning ability. This method was implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11.

This index measures the dynamical coupling and numerical stability of the generalized inertia matrix of a manipulator in its dynamics model. Reduction of this index weakens the dynamic coupling while increasing the numerical stability of the dynamics model, which leads in turn to an improvement of the robot performance for simulation and control under dynamical conditions.

To accomplish this, the robots are prioritized. A path that avoids only the stationary obstacles is planned for the highest-priority robot. A trajectory for the next-lowest priority robot is planned so that it avoids both the stationary obstacles and the higher-priority robot, which is treated as a moving obstacle. This process is continued until trajectories for all of the robots have been planned. The planning is accomplished by first mapping the real space of the robots into configuration-space-time. Potential fields are applied around the c-space-time obstacles and are used to modify the path of the robot. The advantage of using artificial potential fields is that they offer a relatively fast and efficient way to solve for safe trajectories around both stationary and moving obstacles. In the method used to perform path planning, a trial path through the c-span-time is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential fields until an appropriate path is found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126028","startPage":"500","endPage":"505 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126028.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple robot path coordination using artificial potential fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Orbital robotics","Path planning","Mechanical engineering","Motion planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","trajectory planning","path coordination","artificial potential fields","stationary obstacles","moving obstacle","c-span-time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multiple robot path coordination using artificial potential fields","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","accessionNumber":"3863675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple robot path coordination using artificial potential fields","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040128S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"126","articleId":"126028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":126037,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The control technique selected for time delay is based on the use of a high-fidelity graphics phantom robot that is being controlled in real time (without time delay) against the static task image. Thus, the motion of the phantom robot image on the monitor predicts the motion of the real robot. The real robot's motion will follow the phantom robot's motion on the monitor with the communication time delay implied in the task. Real-time high-fidelity graphics simulation of a PUMA arm is generated and overlaid on the actual camera view of the arm. A simple camera calibration technique is used for calibrated graphics overlay. A preliminary experiment is performed with the predictive display by using a very simple tapping task. The results with this simple task indicate that predictive display enhanced the human operator's telemanipulation task performance significantly during free motion when there is a long time delay.

A VFH-controlled mobile robot maneuvers quickly and without stopping among densely cluttered obstacles. The VFH method uses a two-dimensional Cartesian histogram grid as a world model. This world model is updated continuously and in real time with range data sampled by the onboard ultrasonic range sensors. Based on the accumulated environmental data, the VFH method then computes a one-dimensional polar histogram that is constructed around the robot's momentary location. Each sector in the polar histogram holds the polar obstacle density in that direction. Finally, the algorithm selects the most suitable sector from among all polar histogram sectors with low obstacle density, and the steering of the robot is aligned with that direction. Experimental results from a mobile robot traversing a densely cluttered obstacle course at an average speed of 0.7 m/s demonstrate the power of the VFH method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126042","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126042.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"577 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots in cluttered environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots in cluttered environments","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3863686","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots in cluttered environments","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051741S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"136","articleId":"126042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126052,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

The operator interactively sets up the execution environment and specifies input parameters for a variety of available task primitives. Several task primitives can be stored together as a task sequence for later sequence execution. The primitives or sequences can be executed on a graphics simulator or on the JPL Telerobot, which includes two task execution manipulators, one manipulator used for positioning cameras, and two six-degree-of-freedom force reflecting hand controllers used for shared and teleoperation modes of execution. In supervisory control, the operator sets up a task primitive or a sequence of primitives and executes the task autonomously. In teleoperation, the user specifies desired initialization parameters and controls the arms with the hand controllers. In shared control, teleoperated inputs from the operator hand controllers are merged during task execution with inputs from user parameterized autonomous primitives.

Compliance is treated as a nonlinear mapping from a measured force to a corrected motion. The nonlinear mapping is represented by a multilayered neural network, which makes it possible to deal with complex strategies of force feedback. This network representation provides not only linear compliance, as represented by stiffness and damping matrices, but also nonlinear compliance, which has never been explored extensively. This network approach also makes it possible to teach a desired compliance from teaching data by using an iterative learning algorithm. Conventional methods of compliant motion control are reviewed, linear compliance and its limits are discussed, and nonlinear compliance based on the network representation is introduced. An analysis is made of the nonlinearity of compliance that arises in performing assembly tasks, and the network structure that meets the requirements for representing a group of nonlinear compliances necessary for performing the assembly tasks is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126167","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1244 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126167.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teaching and learning of compliance using neural nets: representation and generation of nonlinear compliance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126167/","displayDocTitle":"Teaching and learning of compliance using neural nets: representation and generation of nonlinear compliance","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3886640","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teaching and learning of compliance using neural nets: representation and generation of nonlinear compliance","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043507S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"80","articleId":"126167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":126185,"authors":[{"name":"H.F.

This architecture takes the form of a network of sensor nodes, each with its own processing facility, which together do not require any central processor or any central communication facility. In this architecture, computation is performed locally and communication occurs between any two nodes. Such an architecture has many desirable properties, including robustness to sensors failure and flexibility to the addition or loss of one or more sensors. This architecture is appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based geometric data fusion problems. The starting point for this architecture is an algorithm which allows the complete decentralization of the multisensor EKF equations among a number of sensing nodes. This algorithm is described, and it is shown how it can be applied to a number of different data-fusion problems. An application of this algorithm to the problem of multicamera, real-time tracking of objects and people moving through a room is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875304","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Toward a fully decentralized architecture for multi-sensor data fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a fully decentralized architecture for multi-sensor data fusion","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05348S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"64","articleId":"126185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":126216,"authors":[{"name":"L.

These samples are repeatedly presented to the sensors, and the network will, each time, make a decision about the surface roughness which is then compared to the correct answer. The error is used to modify the connection weights. Following this training period, the net is able to identify the quality of surfaces presented to it, even in the presence of noise caused by poor illumination. Experimental results from a set of lapped surfaces are discussed with regard to the fusion of different features in order to obtain an adequate measure of surface roughness using the neural network.

The algorithm incrementally builds a graph connecting the local minima of a potential function defined in the robot's configuration space and concurrently searches the graph until a goal configuration is attained. A local minimum is connected to another one by executing a random motion that escapes the well of the first minimum, succeeded by a gradient motion that follows the negated gradient of the potential function. All the motions are executed in a grid shown through the robot's configuration space. The random motions are implemented as random walks which are known to converge toward Brownian motions when the steps of the walks tend toward zero. The local minima graph is searched using a depth-first strategy with random backtracking. In the technique, the planner does not explicitly represent the local-minima graph. The path-planning algorithm has been fully implemented and has run successfully on a variety of problems involving robots with many degrees of freedom.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126256","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1717 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monte-Carlo algorithm for path planning with many degrees of freedom","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Monte-Carlo algorithm for path planning with many degrees of freedom","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126256/","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3863796","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monte-Carlo algorithm for path planning with many degrees of freedom","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034631S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"131","articleId":"126256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":126273,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The overall system can be thought of as a composite of two subsystems; one is the vehicle with m degrees of freedom, and the other is the robot arm with n degrees of freedom. The interconnections between them are unknown interactive forces. To overcome the effects of the unknown interactive forces and some mismatches between the estimated parameter values and the actual ones, a decentralized continuous robust controller is proposed. Conditions are derived for stability when the interconnections are not known. The theoretical analysis and computer simulation results show that the performance of the continuous robust controller is much better than that of the nonrobust controller. An interesting conclusion is that one can choose arbitrarily large weighting gains to decrease the trajectory errors without increasing the magnitude of the physical control torques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126273","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1827 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126273.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized continuous robust controller for mobile robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Robot control","Mobile robots","Interconnected systems","Vehicles","Parameter estimation","Force control","Stability","Performance analysis","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","decentralised control","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite system model","wheeled mobile robot","decentralized continuous robust controller","trajectory errors","control torques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized continuous robust controller for mobile robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","accessionNumber":"3886679","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized continuous robust controller for mobile robots","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024428S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"69","articleId":"126273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":126281,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The actuator employs a hybrid combination of DC servomotors and muscle-like bladder actuators. One DC motor-muscle actuator pair is arranged coantagonistically with an identical DC motor-muscle actuator pair to drive a manipulator joint. Through a suitable control applied to the hybrid actuator, independent control of joint torsional stiffness and joint position is made possible. When air pressure is varied in the muscle actuators, the muscle actuator stiffness and length change. In order to only affect the hybrid actuator stiffness with this pressure change. DC servomotors are used to compensate for muscle actuator length changes, hence joint position is unaffected. High-gain servomotor control ensures a response to disturbances due almost solely to the muscle actuator stiffness characteristics. Dynamic equations of motion are developed for a two-joint manipulator with a hybrid actuator used to drive the final link. A control is formulated for this system to achieve, in addition to independent joint torsional stiffness and joint position control, approximately decoupled and linearized dynamics. A numerical simulation of this two-degree-of-freedom system is presented to verify the performance of the closed-loop system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/484/3534/00126281.pdf","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1878 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid actuator for robot manipulators: design, control and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Robot control","Muscles","Servomotors","Manipulator dynamics","Bladder","Equations","Control systems","Position control","Linear approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","closed loop systems","DC motors","robots","servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic equations of motion","hybrid actuation method","DC servomotors","muscle-like bladder actuators","joint torsional stiffness","joint position","two-degree-of-freedom system","closed-loop system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid actuator for robot manipulators: design, control and performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3886687","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid actuator for robot manipulators: design, control and performance","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044204S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"11","articleId":"126281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126295,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This means that all the online computational problems associated with computing robot inverse dynamics can be avoided, and the robot control problem is essentially reduced to that of computing n linear proportional-derivation controls for n joint subsystems. The proposed control technique employs a time-delayed control with a specially designed constant diagonal gain matrix to decouple and linearize the robot joint dynamics so that linear centralized joint control can be achieved. It is shown that the proposed controller is stable, and the value of the special gain matrix can be selected based on a sufficient condition of stability presently developed. However, the establishment of this sufficient condition requires knowledge of the inertial matrix of the robot. It is also shown that the controller is robust in the presence of payload uncertainty. A two-link planar robot is presented to illustrate the controller design procedures and the performance of the controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126310/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3863819","conferenceDate":"13-18 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robot manipulator control using decentralized linear time-invariant time-delayed joint controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot manipulator control using decentralized linear time-invariant time-delayed joint controllers","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00126310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02693S","chronDate":"13-18 May 1990","isNumber":"3534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"484","citationCount":"144","articleId":"126310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":126315,"authors":[{"name":"C.I.

It is pointed out that miniaturized MOSFETs with channel lengths even shorter than one tenth of a micrometer could probably be realized with superior performance, but the circuit technique of using them at low-voltage power supplies still remains a challenge. Finally, it is pointed out that the real challenges in the future will be design and test limits of huge systems, and the real goals of engineers in the future will be functional integration rather than scale integration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.126533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3538/00126533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.126533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"465","endPage":"472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Limitations, innovations, and challenges of circuits and devices into a half micrometer and beyond","volume":"27","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4165926","publicationDate":"April 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations, innovations, and challenges of circuits and devices into a half micrometer and beyond","sourcePdf":"00126533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037602S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"48","articleId":"126533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126534,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

An architecturally based scaling strategy is presented which indicates that the optimum voltage is much lower than that determined by other scaling considerations. This optimum is achieved by trading increased silicon area for reduced power consumption.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","volume":"27","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4165927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-power CMOS digital design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power CMOS digital design","sourcePdf":"00126534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03287S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1771","articleId":"126534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":126535,"authors":[{"name":"C.-L.

A layout scheme with a column-interleaved memory and a new ROM circuit are introduced for the efficient implementation of memory-based signal processing circuits.

Many process and performance constraints associated with the conventional flash EEPROM have been eliminated through the development of a new flash EEPROM cell and new circuit techniques. Design of the 512-kb flash EEPROM, which is programmable for different array sizes, has been evaluated from 256- and 384-kb arrays embedded in new 32-b microcontrollers. The 512-kb flash EEPROM has incorporated the newly developed source-coupled split-gate (SCSG) flash EEPROM cell, Zener-diode controlled programming voltages, internally generated erase voltage, and a new differential sense amplifier. It has eliminated overerase and program disturb problems without relying on tight process controls and on critical operational sequences and timings, such as intelligent erase, intelligent program, and preprogram before erase. A modular approach was used for chip design to minimize development time and for processing technology to achieve high manufacturability and flexibility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3538/00126546.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 512-kb flash EEPROM embedded in a 32-b microcontroller","doi":"10.1109/4.126546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.126546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 512-kb flash EEPROM embedded in a 32-b microcontroller","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4165939","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 512-kb flash EEPROM embedded in a 32-b microcontroller","sourcePdf":"00126546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044073S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"20","articleId":"126546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126547,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It realizes a two-transistor/one-capacitor (2Tr-1C) dual-port memory cell array with immunity against the array noise caused by the dual-port operation. This architecture, called a truly dual-port (TDP) DRAM, adopts the previously proposed divided/shared bit-line (DSB) sensing scheme in a dual-port 2Tr-1C DRAM array. A 2Tr-1C dual-port memory cell array with folded bit-line sensing operation, which does not increase the number of bit lines of the 1Tr-1C folded bit-line memory array, is realized, thus reducing the memory cell size. This architecture offers a solution to the fundamental limitations in the 2Tr-1C dual-port memory cell, and it is easily applicable to dual-port memory cores in ASIC environments. An analysis of the memory array noise in various dual-port architectures shows a significant improvement with this architecture.

Circuit speed is also found to be insensitive to the initial bit-line difference voltage. The CBLSA maintains a low impedance fixed potential on the bit lines during sensing, virtually eliminating sensitivity to inter-bit-line noise coupling and minimizing power supply bounce during sensing.

The sensing scheme was successfully implemented on an experimental HSDRAM fabricated by using 0.7- mu m L/sub eff/ CMOS technology, and a high-speed random access time of 15 ns and a low power dissipation of 144 mW were obtained for 512-kb array activation with a fast cycle time of 60 ns at 3.6 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3538/00126563.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.126563","doi":"10.1109/4.126563","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126563","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","CMOS technology","MOS devices","Laboratories","Clocks","Pulse circuits","Energy consumption","Stability","Capacitors","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic RAM","pulsed sensing scheme","limited bit-line swing","CMOS","high-speed DRAMs","cross-coupled sense amplifier","pulsed sense clock","reference voltage generator","trench decoupling capacitors","random access time","power dissipation","cycle time","4 Mbit","0.7 micron","3.6 V","15 ns","144 mW","512 kbit","60 ns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A pulsed sensing scheme with a limited bit-line swing","accessionNumber":"4170791","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pulsed sensing scheme with a limited bit-line swing","sourcePdf":"00126563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047043S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1","articleId":"126563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":126576,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Bamieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Bamieh","id":"37299680500"},{"name":"J.B.

They use an ANN adaptive whitening filter to model the lower frequencies of the electrocardiogram (ECG) which are inherently nonlinear and nonstationary. The residual signal which contains mostly higher frequency QRS complex energy is then passed through a linear matched filter to detect the location of the QRS complex. The authors developed an algorithm to adaptively update the matched filter template from the detected QRS complex in the ECG signal itself so that the template can be customized to an individual subject. This ANN whitening filter is very effective at removing the time-varying, nonlinear noise characteristic of ECG signals. The detection rate for a very noisy patient record in the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database is 99.5% with this approach, which compares favorably to the 97.5% obtained using a linear adaptive whitening filter and the 96.5% achieved with a bandpass filtering method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.126604","doi":"10.1109/10.126604","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3540/00126604.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based adaptive matched filtering for QRS detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based adaptive matched filtering for QRS detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166041","pubMedId":"1592397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based adaptive matched filtering for QRS detection","sourcePdf":"00126604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044978S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"276","articleId":"126604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126605,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Evaluation of these functions at a specified time point produces a system characterization for that instant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.126615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3540/00126615.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.126615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous characterization of time varying nonlinear systems (neurophysiological responses)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous characterization of time varying nonlinear systems (neurophysiological responses)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166052","pubMedId":"1592408","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous characterization of time varying nonlinear systems (neurophysiological responses)","sourcePdf":"00126615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054046S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"18","articleId":"126615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":126616,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

The clock feedthrough generated by the chopper circuit is reduced by using the switched-capacitor-filter technique. The switched-capacitor technique is also used to implement the function of demodulation. The simulated current is converted into an output voltage with a slope of approximately 100 mV/nA. The current signal from 0.2 to 8 nA can be measured with a nonlinearity of 3.5%.

A 64-Mb prototype of this architecture is being built. The author investigates manufacturing yield and operational performance of redundant TRAMs with respect to variation of tree depth and redundancy level. For this purpose, a based chip area, a yield and operational performance figure of merit allowing the comparison of various choices, has been formulated and used. The yield is evaluated by a new Markov-chain-based model. The memory operational performance has been analyzed by an innovative technique that substitutes the notion of chip state at the end of the mission time with the cumulative work performed by the chip during the mission time (performability). Optimum values of three tree depth and redundancy level were found for a given RAM size, the adopted reconfiguration strategy, and the kinds of redundancy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","volume":"41","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4190791","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerance considerations for redundant binary-tree-dynamic random-access-memory (RAM) chips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerance considerations for redundant binary-tree-dynamic random-access-memory (RAM) chips","sourcePdf":"00126688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042891S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"4","articleId":"126688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126689,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The authors also describe a rotationally invariant 16-state code that achieves the same asymptotic gain as its linear counterpart. Practical signal constellations are described for 6-D TCM with the spectral efficiency of uncoded 64-QAM, and the performance of these schemes is studied by means of computer simulations.

It includes phase shift keying (PSK) and multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) codes, as well as coherent and partially coherent (e.g. differential, pilot tone, etc.) detection. Due to the form of the exact pairwise error event probabilities, this calculation technique cannot be used with the transfer function technique to obtain an upper (union) bound on the overall bit error probability. For this reason, the authors estimate the bit error probability by considering only a small number of short error events. Through simulations, they found that the estimation is usually very accurate at high signal-to-noise ratios but not as accurate at lower signal-to-noise ratios. They study several coded modulation schemes this way. Among the results are the fact that TCM provides significant improvement in the error floor when detected differentially, and an asymmetry in the pairwise error event probability for 16 QAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.126709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3543/00126709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.126709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"74","endPage":"83","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the error performance of trellis-coded modulations in Rayleigh-fading channels","volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4166267","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the error performance of trellis-coded modulations in Rayleigh-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00126709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038155S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"220","articleId":"126709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126715,"authors":[{"name":"N.T.

The error resilient positional code (ERPC) is an efficient fixed-rate coding scheme for encoding such positional information, or, equivalently, sparse binary data patterns. It has also been designed with good channel error robustness properties, such that the decoded data quality degrades gracefully with worsening channel conditions, without the possibility of catastrophic breakdown or loss of sync. In this work, the coding efficiency of the ERPC is compared to a few other standard schemes. It is found to be efficient and its error extension in terms of the expected number of samples corrupted per bit error is reported and shown to be low and noncatastrophic. The ERPC is applied to an image coding example based on subband coding and vector quantization. It results in an efficient adaptive codec capable of operating in harsh channel conditions, without the aid of error correction or detection techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4166273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The ERPC: an efficient error-resilient technique for encoding positional information or sparse data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ERPC: an efficient error-resilient technique for encoding positional information or sparse data","sourcePdf":"00126715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05723S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","articleId":"126715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126716,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

It is shown that saturation is responsible for the generation of flux space harmonic components traveling in the air gap with the same synchronous speed as the fundamental flux component, with the third being the dominant harmonic component. Superposition of the effects of the fundamental and third harmonic components of the air gap flux is utilized in order to model the saturation of the ferromagnetic parts of the machine. The concept of winding functions is used to derive the inductance terms relating to both stator and rotor winding components. In this approach, the air gap length is assumed to be variable, being a function of the position and level of the air gap flux. Terminal and torque values for steady and transient states are obtainable from the proposed model, with experimental results showing that the model proposed predicts spatial saturation effects with good accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.126740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3544/00126740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.126740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3544","startPage":"343","endPage":"349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of saturated AC machines including air gap flux harmonic components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of saturated AC machines including air gap flux harmonic components","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166237","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of saturated AC machines including air gap flux harmonic components","sourcePdf":"00126740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047331S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","isNumber":"3544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"148","articleId":"126740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":126745,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The control feeds measured spindle torque into the drive current regulator, typically increasing damping by 50 to 100%, which is comparable with other damping methods reviewed. A scale model and a large full-scale mill have both been tested with the new control loop. The increased damping is required as a result of efforts to increase rolling mill production through higher speeds and bite angles, with a consequent increase in the incidence of resonant torsional vibration problems such as shudder or chatter. A large reduction in motor speed drop and recovery time is an additional benefit. Tuning of the motor speed and current regulators can be of some help in improving the damping of the drive system; however, the speed-sensor ripple and sampling delays of the digital speed regulator limit the scope for improvement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.126752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3544/00126752.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"433","doi":"10.1109/28.126752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of a digitally controlled static power converter for the damping of rolling mill torsional vibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of a digitally controlled static power converter for the damping of rolling mill torsional vibration","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of a digitally controlled static power converter for the damping of rolling mill torsional vibration","sourcePdf":"00126752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034988S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","isNumber":"3544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"15","articleId":"126752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":126755,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is seen that the complex PARCOR coefficients tend to provide more accurate classification than the complex AR coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.126809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3547/00126809.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"496","doi":"10.1109/34.126809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex autoregressive model for shape recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Complex autoregressive model for shape recognition","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166331","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex autoregressive model for shape recognition","sourcePdf":"00126809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056263S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"67","articleId":"126809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":126844,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

It is shown that use of B-spline receptive field functions in conjunction with more general CMAC weight addressing schemes allows higher-order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives.

The end-effector position and orientation control loop is closed using visual data to generate the necessary control inputs for the manipulator joints by two neural networks. The task considered is to move the manipulator end-effector to a position where an object can easily be gripped. The relations between image data of the object and joint angles of the desired manipulator end-effector position and orientation are clearly nonlinear. The system organizes itself for any manipulator configuration by learning this nonlinear mapping regardless of joint type and geometric dimensions, so that the inverse kinematic solution need not be calculated. A global network learns control signals for larger object distances, and a local network for smaller ones. The generalization ability of the neural networks assures control robustness and adaptability in cases of slightly changed object positions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.126850","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/3549/00126850.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.126850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing visual servo system based on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing visual servo system based on neural networks","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4165200","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing visual servo system based on neural networks","sourcePdf":"00126850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051667S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"28","articleId":"126850","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":126853,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Sartori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Sartori","id":"37378175700"},{"name":"P.J.

Whitted (Commun. ACM, vol.23, no.6 pp.343-349, June 1980) presented on ray tracing is discussed. He proposed making antialiased images by hierarchical adaptive oversampling. The present authors use hierarchical adaptive undersampling to reduce the number of pixels whose intensity must be calculated by ray tracing. To implement pixel-selected ray tracing (PSRT), homogeneous regions in images must first be found. Generally, adaptive undersampling can result in some image-quality defects, because small objects and parts of thin or wedge-shaped objects may disappear when they are located between the initially sampled pixels. PSRT has an improved algorithm that uses pixels with the correct object information from among the sampled pixels to find pixels with erroneous color and correct them. Moreover, PRST uses ray-object intersection trees for precise classification of the homogeneity of regions and for fast intensity calculation in homogeneous regions. Experimental results are presented.

The algorithm reconstructs cone-beam projections collected from 'short scan' acquisitions of a detector traversing a noncircular planar orbit. Since the algorithm does not correct for photon attenuation, it is designed to reconstruct data collected over an angular range of slightly more than 180 degrees with the assumption that the range of angles is oriented so as not to acquire the highly attenuated posterior projections of emissions from cardiac radiopharmaceuticals. This sampling scheme is performed to minimize the attenuation artifacts that result from reconstructing posterior projections. From computer simulations, it is found that reconstruction of attenuated projections has a greater effect upon quantitation and image quality than any potential cone-beam reconstruction artifacts resulting from insufficient sampling of cone-beam projections. With nonattenuated projection data, cone beam reconstruction errors in the heart are shown to be small (errors of at most 2%).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4165596","pubMedId":"18218361","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A cone-beam filtered backprojection reconstruction algorithm for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cone-beam filtered backprojection reconstruction algorithm for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography","sourcePdf":"00126915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061459S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"44","articleId":"126915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126918,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

This change in the size of objects with position precludes quantitative measurement of the area of the objects, which is important in endoscopy for accurately measuring ulcer and lesion sizes over time. A method for correcting the distortion characteristic of endoscope images is presented. A polynomial correction formula was developed for the endoscope lens and validated by comparing quantitative test areas before and after the distortion correction. The distortion correction has been incorporated into a computer program that could readily be applied to electronic images obtained at endoscopy using a desk-top computer. The research presented here is a key step towards the quantitative determination of the area of regions of interest in endoscopy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3551/00126918.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.126918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.126918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction of distortion in endoscope images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Endoscopes","Lenses","Area measurement","Distortion measurement","Position measurement","Size measurement","Time measurement","Lesions","Polynomials","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","medical diagnostic computing","optical images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative area measurement","lesion size","ulcer size","endoscope images","spatial distortion","objective lens","polynomial correction formula","distortion correction","computer program","electronic images","desk-top computer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Correction of distortion in endoscope images","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4165599","pubMedId":"18218364","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction of distortion in endoscope images","sourcePdf":"00126918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031247S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"70","articleId":"126918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126957,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

The three requisite processes to obtain complex-baseband beam signals, namely, down conversion to complex baseband, time delay of the complex envelope, and phase rotation, are discussed. Down conversion is accomplished by subsampling the bandpass signal and an efficient interpolation technique is employed for time registration of these samples. Since the same interpolation technique is u sed to implement the time delay, the two processes are combined.

The instrument is found to be capable of rendering the space-time evolution of the void-fraction field from controlled laboratory breaking waves. Field results show measurements of void-fractions (up to 24%) which are several orders of magnitude greater than time averaged values previously reported. Preliminary measurements show that the fraction of breaking waves per wave is dependent on significant wave height and wind speed. The dependence on wind speed is compared with data of previous investigators.

The major concerns are multiple-access interference and the network capacity in terms of the number of users that can transmit simultaneously for a given level of codeword error probability. Block coding is studied in detail. The authors first consider the use of Q-ary Reed-Solomon (RS) codes in combination with M-ary modulation with mismatched alphabets so that Q>M. It is shown that the network capacity is drastically reduced in comparison with the system with matched alphabets. As a remedy, the use of matched M-ary BCH codes is proposed as an alternative to mismatched RS codes. It is shown that when the number of users in the system is large, a BCH code outperforms an RS code with a comparable code rate and decoding complexity. The authors consider the use of a robust technique for generation of reliable side information based on a radio-threshold test. They analyze its performance in conjunction with MFSK and error-erasure correction decoding. It is shown that this nonideal ratio-threshold method can increase the network capacity in comparison with the system with perfect side information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.126983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3555/00126983.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"327","doi":"10.1109/49.126983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-hopped multiple access communications with coding and side information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-hopped multiple access communications with coding and side information","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4145861","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-hopped multiple access communications with coding and side information","sourcePdf":"00126983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029348S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"126983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":126984,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A novel access technique based on bandlimited quasi-synchronous CDMA (BLQS-CDMA) is described, showing all the advantages of synchronizing conventional direct sequence CDMA to drastically reduce the effect of self-noise. Bandlimitation is achieved with no detection loss by means of Nyquist chip shaping, leading to a simple all-digital demodulator structure. Detection losses due to imperfect carrier frequency and chip timing synchronization are analytically derived and numerical results are checked by computer simulations. Impairments due to satellite transponder distortions are evaluated.

The HBR-LET has the capability of adjusting its transmitted uplink power over an approximately 10 dB range to compensate for forward uplink rain attenuation. However, because of size and weight limitations, the MET cannot use power control as a rain compensation technique. Consequently, the AMT rain compensation algorithm (RCA) is based on a formula for varying the transmitted data rate in either direction to maintain link performance within acceptable limits. The objective of the AMT RCA is to ensure reliable operation in both the forward and return directions despite the possibility of uplink or downlink fading due to rain events in the vicinity of the FT or MT. In particular, the RCA must maintain at least a 3 dB link margin at the highest possible transmission rate (AMT can operate at 9.6, 4.8, or 2.4 kb/s) permitted by the prevailing channel conditions. The 3 dB minimum link margin is a system design safety factor to accommodate conceivable implementation losses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.126987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3555/00126987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.126987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3555","startPage":"358","endPage":"363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rain compensation algorithm for ACTS mobile terminal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=126987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rain compensation algorithm for ACTS mobile terminal","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4145865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rain compensation algorithm for ACTS mobile terminal","sourcePdf":"00126987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056576S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","articleId":"126987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":126992,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This network affords around-the-clock service to any part of the globe, including the polar regions. Such a network can accommodate static and mobile user terminals simultaneously. The oblate globe is modeled as a regular polyhedron with 12 facets for setting up the orbits. Satellites are positioned uniformly in low-altitude symmetrical orbits. The symmetrical orbits are those whose axes are symmetrical in the three-dimensional space. The authors study the coverage aspects of the 6-orbit scheme and the 10-orbit scheme, each with satellites deployed at an altitude of 5000 km. At this altitude, the terrestrial user terminals can access satellites at a grazing angle of 45 degrees . The method of access over the crosslinks is the slotted ALOHA scheme. For low-density traffic, the downlink and uplink throughput rates are estimated.

The class of resource allocation processes to which the satellite BOD application belongs is identified and contrasted with more common resource allocation processes. Several unique features of BOD service complicate the performance specification, modeling, and analysis. The authors divide the modeling problem into three fundamental components: modeling the resource algorithm and modeling the processing of individual resource requests. These modeling components are illustrated with the satellite BOD application. In addition, simulation of the resource allocation requires three additional components: an easy-to-use user input interface, performance measures and statistics gathering, and presentation of simulation results (user output interface). The architecture of the simulation software (resource allocation analysis program, or RAAP) is presented in terms of these six components. To illustrate RAAP's capabilities, example simulation results are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.126997","startPage":"465","endPage":"477","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3555/00126997.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.126997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and simulation of the resource allocation process in a bandwidth-on-demand satellite communications network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Board of Directors","Centralized control","Communication system control","Artificial satellites","Control systems","Bandwidth","Satellite ground stations","Intelligent networks","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","frequency division multiple access","satellite relay systems","software packages","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation process","bandwidth-on-demand satellite communications network","frequency-division multiple-access","FDMA","performance specification","resource algorithm","resource requests","simulation software","resource allocation analysis program","RAAP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/126997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and simulation of the resource allocation process in a bandwidth-on-demand satellite communications network","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4145875","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and simulation of the resource allocation process in a bandwidth-on-demand satellite communications network","sourcePdf":"00126997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029801S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","articleId":"126997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":127037,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.S.

The purpose is to devise a proper restoration plan after the location of a fault has been identified and the faulted zone has been isolated. Since service restoration is an urgent matter in distribution system operation, the restoration plan must be reached in a very short time. In addition, the out-of-service area must be minimized to enhance system reliability. To reach a restoration plan which satisfies all practical requirements, a set of heuristic rules was compiled through interviews with experienced operators at Taiwan Power Company. A heuristic search algorithm was developed for service restoration following a fault on distribution feeders. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic search approach is demonstrated by the restoration of the electricity service following a fault in an underground distribution system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.127075","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/3557/00127075.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"740","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.127075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution system service restoration using a heuristic search approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Distribution system service restoration using a heuristic search approach","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4166990","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution system service restoration using a heuristic search approach","sourcePdf":"00127075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036471S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"90","articleId":"127075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":127082,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The problem was addressed from a system identification perspective, in opposition to the well-established extended Kalman filtering technique. It is shown that, from a simple nonlinear model of the system voltage which involves only two parameters, the recursive least squares and the least means squares algorithms can each provide dynamic estimates of the voltage phasor. The finite derivative of the phase deviation, followed by a moving-average filter, the leads to the local frequency deviation. A constant forgetting factor included in these algorithms provides both fast adaptation in time-varying situations and good smoothing of the estimates when necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.127082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/3557/00127082.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.127082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast adaptive schemes for tracking voltage phasor and local frequency in power transmission and distribution systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127082/","displayDocTitle":"Fast adaptive schemes for tracking voltage phasor and local frequency in power transmission and distribution systems","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4166997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast adaptive schemes for tracking voltage phasor and local frequency in power transmission and distribution systems","sourcePdf":"00127082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029614S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"153","articleId":"127082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127084,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A potential function similar to the electrostatic potential is assigned to each obstacle, and the topological structure of the free space is derived in the form of minimum potential valleys. Path planning is done at two levels. First, a global planner selects a robot's path from the minimum potential valleys and its orientations along the path that minimize a heuristic estimate of the path length and the chance of collision. Then, a local planner modifies the path and orientations to derive the final collision-free path and orientations. If the local planner fails, a new path and orientations are selected by the global planner and subsequently examined by the local planner. This process is continued until a solution is found or there are no paths left to be examined. The algorithm solves a much wider class of problems than other heuristic algorithms and at the same time runs much faster than exact algorithms (typically 5 to 30 min on a Sun 3/260).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.127236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3562/00127236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.127236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3562","startPage":"23","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A potential field approach to path planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A potential field approach to path planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4135256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A potential field approach to path planning","sourcePdf":"00127236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051568S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"394","articleId":"127236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":127239,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.K.

Variations in three welding process parameters-weld bead width, penetration depth, and torch position-were monitored using an infrared sensor.

The effects of weld bead width and torch position perturbations on the temperature distribution were separated so as to identify and control these two weld process parameters simultaneously.

In contrast, velocity measurements obtained through tachometers are, in many cases, contaminated by noise. It is therefore economically and technically interesting to investigate the possibility of controlling robot dynamics by only using angular position measurements. Two alternative approaches for trajectory tracking control via nonlinear estimated state feedback are presented. The first scheme is based on smooth functions, whereas the second uses switching gains. The stability of the closed-loop system is investigated. Both approaches yield exponentially stable closed-loop systems. The local attraction areas are characterized in terms of controller and observer gains, initial state values, and robot model parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","volume":"8","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4135269","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory tracking in robot manipulators via nonlinear estimated state feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory tracking in robot manipulators via nonlinear estimated state feedback","sourcePdf":"00127249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040669S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"98","articleId":"127249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":127258,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The hierarchical nature of the HTG facilitates efficient task-granularity control during code generation, and thus applicability to a variety of parallel architectures. The construction of the HTG at a given hierarchy level, the derivation of the execution conditions of tasks which maximizes task-level parallelism, and the optimization of these conditions which results in reducing synchronization overhead imposed by data and control dependences are emphasized. Algorithms for the formation of tasks and their execution conditions based on data and control dependence constraints are presented. The issue of optimization of such conditions is discussed, and optimization algorithms are proposed. The HTG is used as the intermediate representation of parallel Fortran and C programs for generating parallel source as well as parallel machine code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.127258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"166","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/3563/00127258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.127258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic extraction of functional parallelism from ordinary programs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Program processors","Concurrent computing","Parallel architectures","Computational modeling","Data mining","Parallel machines","Parallel languages","Parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","parallel programming","program compilers","programming theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic extraction","parallel Fortran programs","parallel C programs","parallel source code","functional parallelism","ordinary programs","hierarchical task graph","intermediate parallel program representation","minimal data","control dependences","task-level parallelism","task-granularity control","code generation","parallel architectures","execution conditions","synchronization overhead","optimization algorithms","parallel machine code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Automatic extraction of functional parallelism from ordinary programs","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4167819","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127258/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic extraction of functional parallelism from ordinary programs","sourcePdf":"00127258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047587S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"120","articleId":"127258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127259,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The notion of constraints on data distribution is presented, and it is shown how, based on performance considerations, a compiler identifies constraints to be imposed on the distribution of various data structures.

Results of a study performed on Fortran programs taken from the Linpack and Eispack libraries and the Perfect Benchmarks to determine the applicability of the approach to real programs are presented.

Each physical channel is associated with several small queues, virtual channels, rather than a single deep queue. The virtual channels associated with one physical channel are allocated independently but compete with each other for physical bandwidth. Virtual channels decouple buffer resources from transmission resources. This decoupling allows active messages to pass blocked messages using network bandwidth that would otherwise be left idle. The paper studies the performance of networks using virtual channels using both analysis and simulation. These studies show that virtual channels increase network throughput, by a factor of four for 10-stage networks, and reduce the dependence of throughput on the depth of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.127260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/3563/00127260.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.127260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual-channel flow control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127260/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual-channel flow control","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4167821","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual-channel flow control","sourcePdf":"00127260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027771S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"930","articleId":"127260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127284,"authors":[{"name":"F.

First a differential transconductance element based on CMOS inverters is described. With this circuit a linear, tunable integrator for very-high-frequency integrated filters can be made. This integrator has good linearity properties and nondominant poles in the gigahertz range owing to the absence of internal nodes. The integrator has a tunable DC gain, resulting in a controllable integrator quality factor. Experimental results of a VHF CMOS transconductance-C low-pass filter realized in a 3- mu m CMOS process are given. Both the cutoff frequency and the quality factors can be tuned. The cutoff frequency was tuned from 22 to 98 MHz and the measured filter response is very close to the ideal response of the passive prototype filter. Furthermore, a novel circuit for automatically tuning the quality factors of integrated filters built with these transconductors is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","volume":"27","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4123114","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS transconductance-C filter technique for very high frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS transconductance-C filter technique for very high frequencies","sourcePdf":"00127337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049528S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"458","articleId":"127337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":127338,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The convolutional encoder trellis is modeled by appropriate wiring of decoder processing nodes: a variety of generating codes can be accommodated. Bit-serial communication links between nodes require only a single wire each and thus interconnection area is relatively small. During each decoding cycle, more than 50 b need to be communicated on each serial link and thus the technique is limited to moderate bit rate applications.

Such an antenna may be useful at millimeter wavelengths as an integrated phased array element forming a part of a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC). A suitable geometry for this application is illustrated and an efficient computational procedure developed. Comparisons with experimental results for the input impedance and far-field radiation patterns show excellent agreement. The influence of the dielectric substrate on the performance of an antenna designed to operate at approximately 60 GHz is discussed. Two examples, the first involving the analysis of a coplanar strip transmission line fed antenna and the second involving impedance matching and control of cross-polarized radiation using a folded strip dipole, are given to illustrate practical applications of the analytical method to design problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.127396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3569/00127396.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.127396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the modeling of metal strip antennas contiguous with the edge of electrically thick finite size dielectric substrates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127396/","displayDocTitle":"On the modeling of metal strip antennas contiguous with the edge of electrically thick finite size dielectric substrates","volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4170795","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the modeling of metal strip antennas contiguous with the edge of electrically thick finite size dielectric substrates","sourcePdf":"00127396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062547S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"127396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":127400,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The material is assumed to be homogeneous and characterized by complex values of permittivity and permeability. Muller-type coupled integral equations are derived for the surface electric and magnetic currents. The power reflection coefficient is defined in terms of the scattered far fields. The integral equations are solved by the boundary element method (BEM) with constant elements. Arbitrary surfaces are accommodated by approximating the actual profile by means of linear segments. Other speed-up techniques are utilized to generate a numerically efficient solution. Substantial comparison is made for special cases to verify the formulation. The reflection coefficient is calculated for a variety of surface shapes. A new profile shape is presented that results in a lower reflection coefficient than the commonly used triangular shape.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.127400","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3569/00127400.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.127400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique scattering from lossy periodic surfaces with applications to anechoic chamber absorbers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Oblique scattering from lossy periodic surfaces with applications to anechoic chamber absorbers","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4170799","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique scattering from lossy periodic surfaces with applications to anechoic chamber absorbers","sourcePdf":"00127400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043719S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"56","articleId":"127400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":127401,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

Starting with the physical optics approximation for half-planes that are equally spaced and of equal height, the field incident on successive edges is represented by a multidimensional Fresnel integral, which is then expanded into a series of functions studied by Boersma (1978). When the angle of incidence with respect to the plane containing the edges is small, each edge is in the transition region of the previous edge, which precludes the use of the geometrical theory of diffraction and related asymptotic theories. The solution obtained applies for incidence either from above or below the plane containing the edges, and is especially suited to the case of near-grazing incidence. This method of solution allows for numerical evaluation of a large number of half-screens and shows how the multiple diffracted fields are influenced by the physical parameters. Both incident plane waves and incident cylindrical waves can be treated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.127401","startPage":"170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3569/00127401.pdf","endPage":"177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.127401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127401/","displayDocTitle":"Diffraction of cylindrical and plane waves by an array of absorbing half-screens","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4170800","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffraction of cylindrical and plane waves by an array of absorbing half-screens","sourcePdf":"00127401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041183S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"83","articleId":"127401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":127405,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

The standard deviation between measured and predicted path loss is 5.8 dB for the entire data set, and can be as small as 4 dB for specific areas within a building. Average floor attenuation factors, which describe the additional path loss (in decibels) caused by floors between transmitter and receiver, are found for as many as four floors in a typical office building.

These results demonstrate the feasibility of antennas of this type.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3569/00127406.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.127406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.127406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveguide-fed parallel plate slot array antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Slot antennas","Electromagnetic waveguides","Aperture antennas","Planar arrays","Planar waveguides","Rectangular waveguides","Electromagnetic reflection","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic radiation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeders","antenna radiation patterns","antenna travelling wave arrays","microwave antenna arrays","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide-fed antenna","TEM mode","slot array antenna","planar antenna","radiating slots","square parallel plate waveguide","coupling slots","rectangular waveguide","transverse electromagnetic traveling-wave mode","X-band model antenna","uniform aperture illumination","efficiency","48 percent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Waveguide-fed parallel plate slot array antenna","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4170805","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveguide-fed parallel plate slot array antenna","sourcePdf":"00127406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080548S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","articleId":"127406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127439,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

It is found that by decreasing the temperature from 300 to 77 K. DIBL in NMOS devices with effective channel lengths (L) from 0.5 to 2.0 mu m is improved for the range of L<0.6 mu m and L>1.2 mu m, but is worse for L between 0.6 and 1.2 mu m. The new version of the two-dimensional device numerical simulation program MINIMOS 4.0, which includes device modeling at cryogenic temperatures, was used to investigate this unique characteristic. The measured DIBL characteristics can be explained physically as the transition from surface DIBL through the subsurface DIBL to the bulk DIBL or punchthrough effect at 300 K, but almost a surface DIBL for the whole range of channel length variation at 77 K. Design considerations for the channel doping profile for low-temperature operation based on keeping the same DIBL and V/sub TH/ as required for room-temperature operation are briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.127482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"908","endPage":"915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3572/00127482.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.127482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DIBL in short-channel NMOS devices at 77 K","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS devices","CMOS technology","Temperature distribution","Very large scale integration","Numerical simulation","Cryogenics","Length measurement","Doping profiles","Nitrogen","Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","doping profiles","insulated gate field effect transistors","integrated circuit technology","metal-insulator-semiconductor devices","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","short-channel NMOS devices","two-dimensional numerical simulation","drain-induced barrier lowering","channel length","MINIMOS 4.0","device modeling","punchthrough effect","channel doping profile","low-temperature operation","300 K","77 K","0.5 to 2 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"DIBL in short-channel NMOS devices at 77 K","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4166009","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127482/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DIBL in short-channel NMOS devices at 77 K","sourcePdf":"00127482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048118S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"36","articleId":"127482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127508,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Unlike the full wave eigenvalue approach, the quasi-TEM approach does not give the propagation dispersion characteristics of the line. This work overcomes this problem by first obtaining the solution of each multiconductor mode from the quasi-TEM approach. Then these solutions are used as both basis and testing functions in a variational formulation of the full wave eigenvalue analysis. The result is high accuracy in the dispersive propagation constants of the multiconductor modes. By solving only for high frequency eigenvalues, not for the high frequency eigenvectors, the method is simpler and faster than the conventional full wave dispersion analyses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.127508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3573/00127508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.127508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3573","startPage":"622","endPage":"627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple technique for calculating the propagation dispersion of multiconductor transmission lines in multilayer dielectric media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple technique for calculating the propagation dispersion of multiconductor transmission lines in multilayer dielectric media","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4161834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple technique for calculating the propagation dispersion of multiconductor transmission lines in multilayer dielectric media","sourcePdf":"00127508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082973S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"127508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127522,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The preprocessing algorithms are designed for high speed, so overall simulation time is improved by a factor of up to 560. Compiled-code hardware accelerators offer several advantages. The hardware is simpler than fully hard-wired accelerators. The simplicity of the hardware makes it possible to track advancing implementation technology and to maintain the performance advantage as technology improves. The simulation algorithm is implemented in software, making it possible to implement and maintain multiple algorithms without hardware modifications. The hardware can be used efficiently, since compiled-code techniques can eliminate or statically perform operations that would be repeatedly performed in other hard-wired implementations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.127617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3577/00127617.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.127617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3577","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compiled-code hardware accelerator for circuit simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127617/","displayDocTitle":"A compiled-code hardware accelerator for circuit simulation","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4161332","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compiled-code hardware accelerator for circuit simulation","sourcePdf":"00127617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047449S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"127617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":127623,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm approaches this problem in a general way, allowing it to be used over a wide range of different FPGA routing architectures. It addresses the issue of scarce routing resources by considering the side effects that the routing of one connection has on another, and also has the ability to optimize the routing delays of time-critical connections. CGE has been used to obtain excellent routing results for several industrial circuits implemented in FPGAs with various routing architectures. The results show that CGE can route relatively large FPGAs in very close to the minimum number of tracks as determined by global routing, and it can successfully optimize the routing delays of time-critical connections. CGE has a linear run time over circuit size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3577/00127623.pdf","doi":"10.1109/43.127623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.127623","startPage":"620","endPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A detailed router for field-programmable gate arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127623/","displayDocTitle":"A detailed router for field-programmable gate arrays","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4161338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A detailed router for field-programmable gate arrays","sourcePdf":"00127623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045993S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"83","articleId":"127623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127695,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Fraser","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Fraser","id":"37284690400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-6648"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1772"}],"articleNumber":"127695","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation","abstract":"The growing body of theory and method is surveyed.

The acquisition system utilizes a bank of parallel I-Q noncoherent matched filters for the search mode, and a coincidence detector for the verification mode. The probabilities of detection and false alarm are derived and the mean and variance of the acquisition time are evaluated as a measure of the system performance. The nonselective channel is a Rayleigh fast fading channel, while the frequency-selective channel model is the so-called wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS), selective only on frequency.

It is first shown that the two presently available receivers, namely, the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) receiver and the simultaneous estimation receiver, do not perform adequately for this problem. A two-stage receiver is proposed in which the unknown channel fading gains are estimated in the first stage prior to data sequence estimation in the second stage. This receiver is shown to perform adequately, and leads to an efficient receiver/decoder for Viterbi decoding of convolutionally trellis-coded sequences. The issue of optimum estimation of channel fading gains is clarified.

In the literature, the minimum distance of ideal RSSE has been employed for approximating the error probability of real RSSE. However, this approximation can be very poor, even though the system has a large signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, a union upper bound on the error probability for ideal RSSE is used to approximate the true error probability. This union bound provides a better approximation than the minimum distance. A new method based on a stack algorithm and a subset-error state diagram is proposed for calculating this union bound. The stack algorithm is employed because it provides a good tradeoff between computer memory and computing time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127779/","volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4175095","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error probability for reduced-state sequence estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probability for reduced-state sequence estimation","sourcePdf":"00127779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039143S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","articleId":"127779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":127780,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Time-reversal is done by storing each block of received signal samples in a buffer and reversing the sequential order of the signal samples in time prior to equalization. As a result, the equivalent channel impulse response as seen by the equalizer is a time-reverse of the actual channel impulse response. Selective time-reversal operation, therefore, allows a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with a small number of forward filter taps to perform equally well for both minimum-phase and maximum-phase channel characteristics. The author evaluates the theoretical performance bounds for such a receiver and quantifies the possible performance improvement for discrete multipath channels with Rayleigh fading statistics. Two extreme cases of DFE examples are considered: an infinite-length DFE; and a DFE with a single forward filter tap. Optimum burst and symbol timing recovery is addressed and several practical schemes are suggested. Simulation results are presented. The combined use of equalization and diversity reception is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","publicationDate":"April 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4175098","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A decision feedback equalizer with time-reversal structure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decision feedback equalizer with time-reversal structure","sourcePdf":"00127782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050648S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"68","articleId":"127782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":127783,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

This work evaluates the performance of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in the presence of cyclostationary interference (CI), intersymbol interference (ISI), and additive white noise (AWN). A comparison between a DFE with CI and one with stationary interference (SI) shows the ability of the DFE to substantially suppress CI. Fractionally spaced and symbol-rate DFE equalizers are also compared and the former is found to yield better performance, especially in the presence of CI. The use of a symbol-rate DFE using an adaptive timing technique that finds the receiver's best sampling phase is proposed for when the fractionally spaced DFE cannot be used because of its complexity. The results also demonstrate the potential benefits of synchronizing central office transmitter clocks, if a fractionally spaced DFE is used at the receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary crosstalk suppression by decision feedback equalization on digital subscriber loops","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.127785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3583/00127785.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.127785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary crosstalk suppression by decision feedback equalization on digital subscriber loops","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4175101","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary crosstalk suppression by decision feedback equalization on digital subscriber loops","sourcePdf":"00127785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055825S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","articleId":"127785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127867,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

In particular, minimum mean square error (MMSE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) signal estimators are developed using hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the clean signal and the noise process. It is shown that the MMSE estimator comprises a weighted sum of conditional mean estimators for the composite states of the noisy signal, where the weights equal the posterior probabilities of the composite states given the noisy signal. The estimation of several spectral functionals of the clean signal such as the sample spectrum and the complex exponential of the phase is also considered. A gain-adapted MAP estimator is developed using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The theoretical performance of the MMSE estimator is discussed, and convergence of the MAP estimator is proved. Both the MMSE and MAP estimators are tested in enhancing speech signals degraded by white Gaussian noise at input signal-to-noise ratios of from 5 to 20 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3587/00127947.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.127947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.127947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian estimation approach for speech enhancement using hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Speech enhancement","Degradation","Signal processing","Hidden Markov models","State estimation","Additive noise","Mean square error methods","Phase estimation","Expectation-maximization algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","speech analysis and processing","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech analysis","speech processing","HMM","SNR","gain adaptation","speech enhancement","hidden Markov models","Bayesian estimation","speech signals","additive noise","minimum mean square error","MMSE","maximum a posteriori","MAP","signal estimators","noise process","weighted sum","conditional mean estimators","noisy signal","posterior probabilities","spectral functionals","sample spectrum","complex exponential","phase","expectation-maximization algorithm","white Gaussian noise","input signal-to-noise ratios","5 to 20 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian estimation approach for speech enhancement using hidden Markov models","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4172908","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian estimation approach for speech enhancement using hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00127947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047148S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"153","articleId":"127947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127951,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The losslessness of the polyphase component matrix, in turn, is sufficient to ensure that the analysis/synthesis system satisfies perfect reconstruction (PR). Using this result, a novel design procedure is presented based on the two-channel lossless lattice. This enables the design of a large class of FIR (finite impulse response)-PR filter banks, and includes the N=2M case. It is shown that this approach requires fewer parameters to be optimized than in the pseudo-QMF (quadrature mirror filter) designs and in the lossless lattice based PR-QMF designs (for equal length filters in the three designs). This advantage becomes significant when designing long filters for large M. The design procedure and its other advantages are described in detail.

By processing the different channels and/or experiments one at a time, the multichannel and/or multiexperiment algorithm decomposes into a set of intertwined single-channel single-experiment algorithms. For multichannel algorithms, the general case of possibly different filter orders in different channels is handled. Geometrically, this modular decomposition approach corresponds to a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of multiple error vectors. Algebraically, this technique corresponds to matrix triangularization of error covariance matrices and converts matrix operations into a regular set of scalar operations. Modular algorithm structures that are amenable to VLSI implementation on arrays of parallel processors naturally follow from the present approach. Numerically, the resulting algorithm benefits from the advantages of triangularization techniques in block processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3587/00127952.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.127952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.127952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=127952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular and numerically stable fast transversal filters for multichannel and multiexperiment RLS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transversal filters","Resonance light scattering","Signal processing algorithms","Laboratories","Covariance matrix","Matrix decomposition","Least squares methods","Matrix converters","Very large scale integration","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","telecommunication channels","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel RLS","numerical stability","fast transversal filters","multiexperiment RLS","fast recursive least squares algorithms","multiexperiment algorithm","multichannel algorithms","modular decomposition","Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization","error vectors","matrix triangularization","error covariance matrices","matrix operations","scalar operations","VLSI","parallel processors","block processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Modular and numerically stable fast transversal filters for multichannel and multiexperiment RLS","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4172913","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular and numerically stable fast transversal filters for multichannel and multiexperiment RLS","sourcePdf":"00127952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053196S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","articleId":"127952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":127956,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

The algorithms make successful use of the condition that the reciprocal DOA (direction-of-arrival) spectrum is a multilinear function in the small, i.e. over the region of adjacent grid points. Since polarization is a linear parameter subspace, a DOA spectrum can be computed without recourse to the unknown polarizations. Then, vector interpolation is replaced by bivector interpolation to address the radio wavefield case. The approach distinguishes between sensor arrays in scalar wavefields (e.g. acoustic) and those in vector wavefields (e.g. electromagnetic).

The algorithm that is presented is a generalization of the K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in an iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an 8-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented that results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details.

Applications show examples of window design and the interest in the Papoulis window in some problems of spectral parameters estimation: Pisarenko (1973) frequency estimation and autoregressive modelization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.127977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3587/00127977.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"999","doi":"10.1109/78.127977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cost minimization approach for optimal window design in spectral analysis of sampled signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A cost minimization approach for optimal window design in spectral analysis of sampled signals","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4172938","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/127977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cost minimization approach for optimal window design in spectral analysis of sampled signals","sourcePdf":"00127977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027363S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","articleId":"127977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":127980,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

The polynomial systems considered are those nonlinear systems whose output signals can be related to the input signals through a truncated Volterra series expansion or a recursive nonlinear difference equation. The Volterra series expansion can model a large class of nonlinear systems and is attractive in adaptive filtering applications because the expansion is a linear combination of nonlinear functions of the input signal. The basic ideas behind the development of gradient and recursive least-squares adaptive Volterra filters are first discussed. Adaptive algorithms using system models involving recursive nonlinear difference equations are then treated. Such systems may be able to approximate many nonlinear systems with great parsimony in the use of coefficients. Also discussed are current research trends and new results and problem areas associated with these nonlinear filters.

Sufficient detail and references are furnished to enable ready implementation, and examples are provided to demonstrate superiority over established classical techniques. The ARMA identification algorithm presented does not require a priori knowledge of, or assumptions about, the order of the system to be identified or signal to be modeled. A suboptimal, recursive, pairwise search of the orthogonal candidate data records is conducted, until a given least-squares criterion is satisfied. In the case of nonlinear systems modeling, discrete-time Volterra series is stressed, or rather a more efficient parallel-cascade approach. The model is constructed by adding parallel paths (each consisting of the cascade of dynamic linear and static nonlinear systems). In the case of time-series analysis, a non-Fourier sinusoidal series approach is stressed. The relevant frequencies are estimated by an orthogonal search procedure.

No assumptions are made about the continuity of the circuit response at the switching instants; even Dirac impulses are permitted. In fact, it is shown that Dirac impulses must be considered for the analysis of some switched networks, even though they may only be present for intermediate steps of the analysis. Several topological changes may be needed at each switching instant to ensure that the topology after switching is valid. The theories have been implemented in a computer program, SWANN. The network equations are generated with a two-graph modified nodal analysis technique, rather than the state equation formulation. Various internally controlled switches are permitted, such as the ideal diode, thyristor, and voltage- and current-controlled switches.

The basic idea is to take one variable as a parameter and to make the system a continuous function of this parameter. The critical values of the parameter under which the system becomes unstable are then found. The critical values can be computed via checking singularity of the Sylvester resultant matrix or Kronecker sum in some specific domains. This is equivalent to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. If a filter is stable, the estimation of the margin of stability can be obtained simply by scaling these two variables. If a filter is unstable, this algorithm will show all the poles in the unit bidisk and will also give the maximal analytic bidisk. Three examples are given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.128017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/3589/00128017.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"239","doi":"10.1109/81.128017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple method to determine the stability and margin of stability of 2-D recursive filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A simple method to determine the stability and margin of stability of 2-D recursive filters","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4172989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple method to determine the stability and margin of stability of 2-D recursive filters","sourcePdf":"00128017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037335S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"44","articleId":"128017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":128018,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The main characteristics of this approach are that (i) it relies on the assumption that image redundancy can be efficiently exploited through self-transformability on a block-wise basis, and (ii) it approximates an original image by a fractal image. The author refers to the approach as fractal block coding. The coding-decoding system is based on the construction, for an original image to encode, of a specific image transformation-a fractal code-which, when iterated on any initial image, produces a sequence of images that converges to a fractal approximation of the original. It is shown how to design such a system for the coding of monochrome digital images at rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 b/pixel. The fractal block coder has performance comparable to state-of-the-art vector quantizers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"18","endPage":"30","doi":"10.1109/83.128028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.128028","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3590/00128028.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding based on a fractal theory of iterated contractive image transformations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Image coding based on a fractal theory of iterated contractive image transformations","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4163874","pubMedId":"18296137","volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding based on a fractal theory of iterated contractive image transformations","sourcePdf":"00128028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024209S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"863","articleId":"128028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":128029,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

The output indexes of the embedded quantizers are further compressed by use of noiseless entropy coding schemes, such as Huffman or arithmetic codes, resulting in variable-rate outputs. Depending upon the specific configurations of the ECVQ and the ECPVQ over the subbands, many different types of SBC schemes can be derived within the generic 2-D ECSBC framework. Among these, the authors concentrate on three representative types of 2-D ECSBC schemes and provide relative performance evaluations. They also describe an adaptive buffer instrumented version of 2-D ECSBC, called 2-D ECSBC/AEC, for use with fixed-rate channels which completely eliminates buffer overflow/underflow problems. This adaptive scheme achieves performance quite close to the corresponding ideal 2-D ECSBC system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3590/00128029.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.128029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.128029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=128029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive entropy coded subband coding of images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Frequency","Vector quantization","Band pass filters","Image reconstruction","Pulse modulation","Discrete cosine transforms","Entropy coding","Arithmetic","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","filtering and prediction theory","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Huffman codes","image coding","2-D entropy-constrained subband coding","2-D entropy-constrained vector quantization","noiseless entropy coding","arithmetic codes","variable-rate outputs","performance evaluations","adaptive buffer","fixed-rate channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive entropy coded subband coding of images","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4163875","pubMedId":"18296138","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive entropy coded subband coding of images","sourcePdf":"00128029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062968S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"63","articleId":"128029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":128030,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The proposed network allows negative autoconnections for each neuron. A set of algorithms using the proposed neural network model is presented, with various updating modes: sequential updates; n-simultaneous updates; and partially asynchronous updates. The sequential algorithm is shown to converge to a local minimum of the energy function after a finite number of iterations. Since an algorithm which updates all n neurons simultaneously is not guaranteed to converge, a modified algorithm is presented, which is called a greedy algorithm. Although the greedy algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to a local minimum, the l/sub 1/ norm of the residual at a fixed point is bounded. A partially asynchronous algorithm is presented, which allows a neuron to have a bounded time delay to communicate with other neurons. Such an algorithm can eliminate the synchronization overhead of synchronous algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.128030","startPage":"49","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3590/00128030.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.128030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image restoration using a modified Hopfield network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Degradation","Neurons","Neural networks","Greedy algorithms","Upper bound","Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","Power system modeling","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous updates","modified Hopfield network","neural network model","image restoration","negative autoconnections","neuron","sequential updates","partially asynchronous updates","sequential algorithm","energy function","iterations","greedy algorithm","local minimum","partially asynchronous algorithm","bounded time delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Image restoration using a modified Hopfield network","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4163876","pubMedId":"18296139","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image restoration using a modified Hopfield network","sourcePdf":"00128030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046678S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"178","articleId":"128030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":128031,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that the transformed data provide samples of the spatial Fourier transform of the target's reflectivity function. The inverse method can be modified to incorporate deviations of the radar's motion from its prescribed straight line path.

The microgripper is electrostatically driven by flexible, interdigitated comb pairs and has significantly smaller feature sizes than have been reported previously for overhanging microstructures. Problems addressed successfully in the microgripper fabrication include the protection of surface-micromachined fine structures during bulk-silicon etching and rinsing.

The authors have fabricated the stator components of these millimeter diameter motors on silicon wafers. Ultrasonic motors consist of two pieces: a stator and a rotor. The stator includes a piezoelectric film in which bending is induced in the form of a traveling wave. A small glass lens placed upon the stator becomes the spinning rotor. Piezoelectric micromotors overcome the problems currently associated with electrostatic micromotors such as low torque, friction, and the need for high voltage excitation. More importantly, they may offer a much simpler mechanism for coupling power out. Using thin films of lead zirconate titanate on silicon nitride membranes, various types of actuator structures can be fabricated. By combined new robot control systems with piezoelectric motors and micromechanics, the authors propose creating micromechanical systems that are small, cheap and completely autonomous.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.128055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3591","startPage":"44","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/3591/00128055.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piezoelectric micromotors for microrobots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Piezoelectric micromotors for microrobots","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4131231","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoelectric micromotors for microrobots","sourcePdf":"00128055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0434S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"183","articleId":"128055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":128057,"authors":[{"name":"Richard P.

The scheme is both practical and unique compared to other proposals in this area, since it is geared to accommodate databases that are not necessarily memory-resident. The scheme capitalizes on the performance advantages offered by MMDBS, without precluding the possibility of having some portions of the database on secondary storage. The heart of the scheme is an innovative approach to recovery processing in MMDBS that eliminates expensive checkpointing activity, which is the commonly used alternative. The main idea is to have an auxiliary processor in charge of reading log records and applying updates to the disk databases accordingly, without accessing the main memory database at all. The advanced I/O technology of disk arrays is incorporated for the implementation of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JCIT.1990.128274","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th Jerusalem Conference on Information Technology, 1990.

Successful task performance depends on an integrated system. rather than on a collection of components. The hardware design takes the form of two large complementary VME-compatible cards: TRIAX, capable of simultaneously acquiring and processing two high-resolution video streams, and JIFFE, capable of 20 MFLOPS for the three-dimensional calculations. Algorithms are described that enable the system to track a rectangular solid, intended to track objects held by a robot hand. The algorithms hinge on scanning only small line segments of the image, followed by techniques for reconstructing object location from sparse edge points.

An approach to obtaining medium-grain parallelism, called macro actors tokens, is investigated. A set of guidelines is identified in the contest of production systems to derive well-formed macro actors from primitive macro actors. Parallel pattern matching is written in macro actors/tokens to be executed on a macro dataflow simulator.

The task was to accurately follow a winding track (with a constant cart velocity) drawn on a flat surface. It was found that simple fixed control laws alone were not sufficient to keep the cart from flipping rapidly around the point of contact with the robot (referred to as 'spinning out'). However, similar fixed control laws were sufficient for training control CMAC neural networks during online learning, such that the plant was rapidly stabilized.

The approach presented here is the utilization of genetic algorithms to evolve the number of neurons in an artificial neural network, the weights of their interconnects, and the interconnect structure itself. With this approach, no a priori assumptions about interconnect structure, weights, number of layers. or to which neurons the inputs or outputs are connected need to be made. A combined neural network evaluation and genetic algorithm evaluation program has been written in C on a Sun workstation.

The artificial neural networks are trained through repetitive training on trajectory-tracking error data to provide an estimate of payload. The payload estimate adapts the feedforward compensator to unmodeled system dynamics and payload variation. The result is a computationally efficient direct form of adaptive control. The AMBNNC concept was previously validated for a single joint. Here, experimentation and analysis are extended to the first three links of a PUMA-560 manipulator. Two forms of neural network payload estimation are investigated. Tracking performance is evaluated for a wide range of payload and trajectory conditions and compared with that of a nonadaptive model-based controller. The performance improvement potential and the limitations of the AMBNNC approach are illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1990.128501","startPage":"486","endPage":"491 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 5th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1990","pdfPath":"/iel2/321/3597/00128501.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 5th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1990.128501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive model-based neural network control: validation and analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Payloads","Artificial neural networks","Manipulator dynamics","Multi-layer neural network","Multilayer perceptrons","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","learning systems","neural nets","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive model-based neural network controller","multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks","robotic manipulators","repetitive training","payload estimate","feedforward compensator","adaptive control","PUMA-560 manipulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive model-based neural network control: validation and analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3945212","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive model-based neural network control: validation and analysis","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00128501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090603S","chronDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"321","citationCount":"3","articleId":"128501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":128502,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An IMC-type neural network controller in which the process model replaced by a neural network gives very good performance, even when only partial state data are available, also gives excellent performance.

It is based on a unidirectional twin-bus architecture. The DQDB protocol lays more emphasis on the overall channel utilization than the fair sharing of channel bandwidth by all the stations. The resulting unfairness problem in which the upstream stations occupy most of the channel bandwidth while the downstream stations get fewer chances to transmit their packets is discussed. Many previously proposed possible fixes are also reviewed. However, these schemes either have a lower performance or cannot guarantee complete fairness when the ratio of end-to-end propagation delay to the slot-size is large. A cycle compensation protocol which ensures complete fairness regardless of the ratio of end-to-end propagation delay to the slot size is described. This proposed protocol also achieves almost the same performance as that of DQDB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128688/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3986354","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cycle compensation protocol: a completely fair protocol for the uni-directional twin-bus architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cycle compensation protocol: a completely fair protocol for the uni-directional twin-bus architecture","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00128688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041763S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"322","citationCount":"10","articleId":"128688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":128731,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The tool is based on formal timing schema that are defined for each source level construct (procedures, statements, expressions). The tool accepts a program and bounds for each loop, and produces predictions for best and worst case execution times. Two versions of the tool were written, using two extremes of granularity for the atomic elements of the timing schema. Within the constraints of the target architecture and compiler, measured execution times for a variety of simple constructs and programs agree with times predicted by the tool. The implementation decomposes naturally into a system-independent part, which is believed to be determined by the 'timing semantics' of the language, and a lower-level system-dependent portion. The experiments validate the general timing schema approach but also point out a number of problems and possible refinements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments with a program timing tool based on source-level timing schema","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings 11th Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1990.128731","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings 11th Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/323/3599/00128731.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1990.128731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=128731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/128731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Experiments with a program timing tool based on source-level timing schema","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4038724","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments with a program timing tool based on source-level timing schema","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00128731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04766S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"323","citationCount":"52","articleId":"128731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":128735,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The performance of Fisher's linear discriminant with multilayer feedforward neural networks (MLFNs) in discriminating the K-complex and background EEG is compared. The results show that the use of the MLFN on feature information can provide a reliable K-complex detection with significantly better performance than that of the linear discriminant.

These occur for signals with components not harmonically related to a fundamental, which are of interest in induction motors. A method allowing accurate measurements of amplitude and phase of each tone in such signals is proposed. The method, which uses the area theorem of the Fourier transform, is simpler than existing methods with which it is compared. The amplitude can be accurately estimated by simply adding the frequency samples in the DFT magnitude spectrum around the main lobe due to a harmonic. A judicious choice of tapered window is necessary prior to computing the DFT. Summation of the real part of the DFT yields the phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast method of estimation of signal parameters using the discrete Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"COMSIG 1989 Proceedings: Southern African Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/COMSIG.1989.129020","displayPublicationTitle":"COMSIG 1989 Proceedings: Southern African Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/538/3602/00129020.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSIG.1989.129020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=129020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Fast method of estimation of signal parameters using the discrete Fourier transform","conferenceDate":"23-23 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3677764","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast method of estimation of signal parameters using the discrete Fourier transform","confLoc":"Stellenbosch, South Africa","sourcePdf":"00129020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03235S","chronDate":"23 Jun 1989","isNumber":"3602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"538","citationCount":"1","articleId":"129020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":129027,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The complete signal flow graph for a minimal hexagonal kernel for both the FFT and the FWT is shown. The derived transforms were implemented in software and compared to the standard 2-D FFT on standard images in the image processing laboratory. It was found that the hexagonal sampling of the image at a lower resolution retained the necessary resolution as required for the rest of the image software.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/COMSIG.1989.129027","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","displayPublicationTitle":"COMSIG 1989 Proceedings: Southern African Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/538/3602/00129027.pdf","publicationTitle":"COMSIG 1989 Proceedings: Southern African Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSIG.1989.129027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hexagonal image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Fast Fourier transforms","Software standards","Image resolution","Digital images","Lattices","Flow graphs","Kernel","Laboratories","Image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","fast Fourier transforms","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hexagonally sampled digital images","fast Fourier transform","fast Walsh transform","data locations","data point","complete signal flow graph","minimal hexagonal kernel","lower resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Hexagonal image processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-23 June 1989","accessionNumber":"3677771","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hexagonal image processing","confLoc":"Stellenbosch, South Africa","sourcePdf":"00129027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032305S","chronDate":"23 Jun 1989","isNumber":"3602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"538","citationCount":"4","articleId":"129027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":129054,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

A profound result is that directional circularly polarized (CP) antennas always reduce RMS delay spread when compared to omnidirectional and directional linearly polarized (LP) antennas in LOS. The variation of RMS delay spread as a mobile moves over several wavelengths is also greatly reduced when CP antennas are used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.129185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3606","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3606/00129185.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.129185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-band microwave propagation parameters using circular and linear polarized antennas for indoor wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Microwave propagation","Polarization","Microwave antennas","Antennas and propagation","Antenna measurements","Delay","Log periodic antennas","Loss measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","mobile antennas","mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband microwave propagation","line of sight channels","path loss models","circularly polarised antennas","directional antennas","indoor mobile radio","UHF","SHF","linear polarized antennas","indoor path loss","cross-polarization discrimination","obstructed channels","RMS delay spread","1.3 GHz","4 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band microwave propagation parameters using circular and linear polarized antennas for indoor wireless channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4161951","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band microwave propagation parameters using circular and linear polarized antennas for indoor wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00129185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029476S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"74","articleId":"129185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":129188,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This block DFE is indexed by two parameters depending on the block length p and the number of decisions q<or=p made at each iteration. The block DFE emulates: the conventional DFE when p=q=1; the maximum likelihood sequence estimator when p=q to infinity ; and the maximum symbol-by-symbol a posteriori optimal detector when q=1, p to infinity . For more general (p,q) parameter settings, one achieves combinations and simplifications of these classical nonlinear detectors. The authors also recover more recently developed nonlinear equalizer structures based on forward tree search algorithms in the high SNR limit (for q=1). They simulate the equalizer using a standard literature example. The theoretical framework presented accommodates autoregressive moving average (ARMA) channels models.

All of the schemes involve encoding the input phase information as a second-order difference and performing an analogous second-order differential detection at the receiver. Because of the back-to-back differential detection operations at the receiver, The performance of most of the schemes is considerably degraded relative to that of first-order differential detection schemes. However, the latter are quite sensitive to frequency offset and, in many instances, cannot be used at all. It is demonstrated that via a simple enhancement of using a 2 T s (instead of T s) delay in the second stage of the encoder and first stage of the decoder, the performance degradation can be significantly reduced. This result is significant in view of the fact that it comes without any penalty in implementation complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.129190","startPage":"278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3606/00129190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.129190","endPage":"291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the implementation and performance of single and double differential detection schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"On the implementation and performance of single and double differential detection schemes","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4161956","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the implementation and performance of single and double differential detection schemes","sourcePdf":"00129190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05231S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"93","articleId":"129190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":129191,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An adaptive array creates a strong capture effect at a packet radio terminal by automatically steering the receiver antenna pattern toward one packet and nulling other contending packets in a slot. A special code preamble and randomized arrival times within each slot allow the adaptive array to lock onto one packet in each slot. The throughput and delay performance of a network with an adaptive array are computed by applying the standard Markov chain analysis of slotted ALOHA. It is shown that throughput levels comparable to carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) are attainable with an adaptive array without the need for stations to be able to hear each other. The performance depends primarily on the number of adaptive array nulls, the array resolution, and the length of the randomization interval within each slot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.129191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3606","startPage":"292","endPage":"300","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3606/00129191.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.129191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the performance of a slotted ALOHA packet radio network with an adaptive array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet radio networks","Adaptive arrays","Slot antennas","Antenna arrays","Throughput","Receivers","Receiving antennas","Adaptive systems","Computer networks","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","packet switching","protocols","radio networks","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","slotted ALOHA packet radio network","adaptive antenna array","strong capture effect","receiver antenna pattern","contending packets","code preamble","randomized arrival times","delay performance","Markov chain analysis","throughput levels","adaptive array nulls","array resolution","randomization interval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Improving the performance of a slotted ALOHA packet radio network with an adaptive array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4161957","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the performance of a slotted ALOHA packet radio network with an adaptive array","sourcePdf":"00129191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043242S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"71","articleId":"129191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":129194,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The study also projects achievable rates on a digital subscriber line, inside and outside of a carrier serving area, with a sophisticated but realizable receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.129198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3606/00129198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.129198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3606","startPage":"361","endPage":"372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable information rates on digital subscriber loops: limiting information rates with crosstalk noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=129198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable information rates on digital subscriber loops: limiting information rates with crosstalk noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4161964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable information rates on digital subscriber loops: limiting information rates with crosstalk noise","sourcePdf":"00129198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070163S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"50","articleId":"129198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":129202,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The partial-band interference is modeled as a Gaussian process. Thermal noise is also included in the analysis. Forward error correction coding is applied using convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon codes. Diversity is found to dramatically reduce the degradation of the noise-normalization receiver caused by partial-band interference regardless of the strength of the direct signal component. Diversity offers significant performance improvement when channel fading is strong, and performance improvement is obtained for high modulation orders (M>2).

The cell loss probability is the focus because the architecture attains the best possible delay-throughput performance if the packet switch modules use output queuing. There are two sources of cell loss in the switch. First, cells are dropped if too many simultaneous arrivals are destined to a group of output ports. Second, because a simple, distributed path-assignment controller is used for speed and efficiency, cells are dropped when the controller cannot schedule a path through the switch. The authors compute an upper bound on arrivals, possibly including isochronous circuit connections, and show that both sources of cell loss can be made negligibly small.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.129205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.129205","endPage":"439","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00129205.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3606/00129205.pdf","startPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a growable architecture for broad-band packet (ATM) switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129205/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a growable architecture for broad-band packet (ATM) switching","volume":"40","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4161971","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a growable architecture for broad-band packet (ATM) switching","sourcePdf":"00129205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032871S","chronDate":"Feb 1992","isNumber":"3606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","articleId":"129205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":129367,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Amplitude and phase imbalances in quadrature mixers give rise to nonlinear signal distortions which can be described using a simple mirror signal model. The mirror signal acts as a correlated interference signal superimposed on the wanted signal and, hence, degrades receiver performance. In other words, the output signal of a quadrature mixer with amplitude and phase imbalances can be decomposed into a wanted signal and a mirror signal. It is shown that this decomposition can be utilized for a rough performance analysis which, in general, overestimates the performance degradation. Simulation results reveal that receivers in digital TDMA mobile radio systems are rather insensitive to quadrature mixer imbalances, which is a consequence of the robustness of the digital modulation schemes applied in such systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DIGCOM.1990.129367","publicationTitle":"International Zurich Seminar on Digital Communications, Electronic Circuits and Systems for Communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Zurich Seminar on Digital Communications, Electronic Circuits and Systems for Communications.","pdfPath":"/iel2/174/3615/00129367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DIGCOM.1990.129367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3615","startPage":"147","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature mixer imbalances in digital TDMA mobile radio receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=129367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature mixer imbalances in digital TDMA mobile radio receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129367/","conferenceDate":"5-8 March 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3876132","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature mixer imbalances in digital TDMA mobile radio receivers","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00129367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047951S","chronDate":"5-8 Mar 1990","isNumber":"3615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"174","citationCount":"30","articleId":"129367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":129373,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The hardware design is space and power efficient, and achieves massive parallelism of analog inner products via charge-based multipliers and spatially distributed summing buses. Basic synaptic cells are constructed of exponential pulse-decay modulation (EPDM) dynamic injection multipliers operating sequentially on propagating signal vectors and locally stored analog weights. Individually adjustable gain controls on each neutron reduce the effects of limited weight dynamic range. A hardware simulator/trainer has been developed which incorporates the physical (nonideal) characteristics of actual circuit components into the training process, thus absorbing nonlinearities and parametric deviations into the macroscopic performance of the network.

The architecture is scalable and flexible enough to be useful for simulating various kinds of networks and paradigms. The computing device is based on an existing coarse-grain parallel framework (INMOS transputers), improved with finer-grain parallel abilities through VLSI chips, and is called the Lneuro 1.0 (for LEP neuromimetic) circuit. The modular architecture of the circuit makes it possible to build various kinds of boards to match the expected range of applications or to increase the power of the system by adding more hardware. The resulting machine remains reconfigurable to accommodate a specific problem to some extent. A small-scale machine has been realized using 16 Lneuros, to experimentally test the behavior of this architecture. Results are presented on an integer version of Kohonen feature maps. The speedup factor increases regularly with the number of clusters involved (to a factor of 80).

These networks realize pseudoanalog performance with local learning rules using digital circuits, and therefore suit silicon technology. The synaptic weights and the outputs of neurons in stochastic logic are represented by stochastic pulse sequences. The limited range of the synaptic weights reduces the coding noise and suppresses the degradation of memory storage capacity. To study the effect of the coding noise on an optimization problem, the authors simulate a probabilistic Hopfield model (Gaussian machine) which has a continuous neuron output function and probabilistic behavior. A proper choice of the coding noise amplitude and scheduling improves the network's solutions of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). These results suggest that stochastic logic may be useful for implementing probabilistic dynamics as well as deterministic dynamics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.129416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"434","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3616/00129416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.129416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional abilities of a stochastic logic neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Logic","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Stochastic resonance","Neurons","Circuit noise","Information processing","Digital circuits","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic logic neural network","information processing ability","pseudoanalog performance","local learning rules","digital circuits","synaptic weights","stochastic pulse sequences","coding noise","memory storage capacity","optimization problem","probabilistic Hopfield model","continuous neuron output function","coding noise amplitude","scheduling","traveling salesman problem","probabilistic dynamics","deterministic dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"Functional abilities of a stochastic logic neural network","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4192633","pubMedId":"18276447","publicationDate":"May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129416/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional abilities of a stochastic logic neural network","sourcePdf":"00129416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059137S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"68","articleId":"129416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":129417,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

The model consists of middle ear, basilar membrane, and hair cell/synapse modules which are derived from neurophysiological studies. The circuit realization of each module is discussed, and experimental data of each module's response to sinusoidal excitation are given. The nonlinear speech processing capabilities of the system are demonstrated using the voiced syllable mod ba mod . The multichannel output of the silicon model corresponds to the time-varying instantaneous firing rates of auditory nerve fibers that have different characteristic frequencies. These outputs are similar to the physiologically obtained responses.

The weights are stored permanently on floating gates and are updated under uniform UV illumination with a general incremental analog four-quadrant outer-product learning scheme, performed locally on-chip by a single transistor per matrix element on average. From the mechanism of floating gate relaxation under UV radiation, the authors derive the learning parameters and their dependence on the illumination level and circuit parameters. It is shown that the weight increments consists of two parts: one term contains the outer product of two externally applied learning vectors; the other part represents a uniform weight decay, with time constant originating from the floating gate relaxation. The authors address the implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with emphasis on the delta rule.

The neural network processor includes a pipelined codebook generator and a paralleled vector quantizer, which obtains a time complexity O(1) for each quantization vector. A mixed-signal design technique with analog circuitry to perform neural computation and digital circuitry to process multiple-bit address information are used. A prototype chip for a 25-D adaptive vector quantizer of 64 code words was designed, fabricated, and tested.

This poses a serious limitation on the integrated circuit realization of high-frequency filters with high-Q poles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/3618/00129457.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.129457","doi":"10.1109/81.129457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=129457","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active noise reduction","Dynamic range","Active filters","Band pass filters","Noise level","Voltage","Resonator filters","Circuits","Nonlinear distortion","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","active networks","band-pass filters","equivalent circuits","network analysis","noise","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active resonators","dynamic range","bandpass filters","tuning capacitance","integrated circuit realization","high-frequency filters","high-Q poles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Noise in active resonators and the available dynamic range","accessionNumber":"4172997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise in active resonators and the available dynamic range","sourcePdf":"00129457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036376S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"51","articleId":"129457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":129459,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The DS-SC circuits that result are designed using the same procedure as standard IIR decimators, and only a different SC implementation results with a reorganized clock phasing. The main advantage is that the time allowed for the op-amps to settle can be equal to the output sampling period rather than one half of it. Using the proposed DS decimators allows the design of high-frequency SC filtering systems (an antialiasing SC decimator filter and a 'core' DS-SC filter) where the op-amp speed requirements are the same in each block.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4172999","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"IIR double-sampled switched-capacitor decimators for high-frequency applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IIR double-sampled switched-capacitor decimators for high-frequency applications","sourcePdf":"00129459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039198S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"5","articleId":"129459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":129837,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Resistances and capacitances of interconnections, input gate capacitances and output driver resistance are used to approximate the interconnection delays during the routing. The router incrementally updates the delay at each sink pin of the signal obtained from the previous step during the routing. The maximum allowable delay at each sink pin (from a timing analyzer) along with the computed interconnection delays is used to guide the search process for the maximum-delay-slack route. It is shown that when the interconnection resistance is comparable to the output-driver resistance, minimizing the total net length is not always equivalent to minimizing the delay for a multiterminal net.

Within this framework two verification tasks, verification by actual execution and by simulation, can be automatically performed using algorithms based on the same concepts. The first idea is to manipulate sets of states and sets of transitions instead of individual states and individual transitions. The second idea is to represent these sets by Boolean functions and to replace operations on sets with operations on Boolean functions. A definition is presented of the two problems addressed and then the authors present the verification algorithms. It is shown that these algorithms use the standard set operations in addition to two specific operations called 'Pre' and 'Img'. A brief explanation is presented as to why the basic set operations are very efficiently performed when sets are denoted by the typed decision graphs of their characteristic functions. The Boolean operators 'constrain' and 'restrict', and the function 'expand' that support efficiently the 'Img' and 'Pre' operations are presented. Experimental results are presented and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129859","startPage":"126","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Most approximate timing simulators preclude inductors from the underlying circuit. Conventional simulators allow inductive effects, but are too inefficient to simulate very large circuits. The formulation presented allows the event-driven simulation of circuits containing inductors, capacitors and general nonlinear elements. The event processing algorithm is based on the conservation of flux and energy. The implementation was tested in a prototype addition to the SPECS simulation environment. In addition, the theory behind the incorporation of mutual inductors is presented. A few benchmarks were run to confirm the veracity of the model. Research into the automatic, dynamic determination of the optimum current resolution would cause the tool to be more efficient, as well as relieve the designer of choosing a current resolution for the inductors in the circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4023226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 1990","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of inductors in piecewise approximate circuit simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of inductors in piecewise approximate circuit simulation","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00129869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027183S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 1990","isNumber":"3621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"296","citationCount":"1","articleId":"129869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":129880,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this approach, sensitivities of performance to parasitics are computed, and a set of bounding constraints for parasitics is determined. Sensitivities are then used to generate the weights for a cost function-driven analog area router. After the routing is completed, the actual values of critical parasitics are used to check if the user-defined constraints on circuit performance are met. If the requirements have not been satisfied, the bounding constraints generated on the parasitics are used to increase the weights associated with the parasitics which violated the constraints, and the circuit is rerouted.

The partitioning goal is to synthesize multi-chip systems from one behavioral description that satisfy both chip area constraints and an overall latency timing constraint. There are three major advantages to using partitioning techniques at the functional abstraction level. First, scheduling techniques can be applied concurrently to partitioning. Therefore, partitioning under timing constraints, and in particular under latency constraints, can be performed. Second, the functional model captures large hardware systems with fewer objects (than at the logic netlist abstraction level), making the partitioning algorithm more efficient. Third, hardware sharing tradeoffs can be considered. Hardware partitioning is formulated as a hypergraph partitioning problem. Algorithms for hardware partitioning are presented and experimental results are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129884","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Therefore, the total test time for IDDQ measurements can be reduced significantly to make IDDQ testing of VLSI CMOS circuits feasible in a production test environment.

The approach models wirelength using a nonlinear cost function similar to that of R.S. Tsay et al. (1988) and a timing model which uses a block-oriented representation of paths like that of M.A.B. Jackson and E.S. Kuh (1989). The timing constraints are implicitly represented using a network and nonlinear programming techniques are used to solve the wirelength minimization problem while satisfying the constraints. This allows critical paths to dynamically adjust while the placement changes to minimize wirelength. The solution of the nonlinear programming problem yields an initial placement of cells that may violate slot constraints. The authors propose hierarchical solution techniques to resolve the slot constraints. By exploiting structure inherent in the formulation, a large reduction is achieved in the number of variables that represent the problem. Additionally, developing special techniques to take advantage of the interaction between the timing model and the physical position of the cells enabled the authors to achieve a speed-up of 10-15 times over Jackson and Kuh (1989) even with a crude implementation of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129916","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

It is based on a new hypergraph multi-partitioning algorithm, whose time complexity is linear in the number of pins of a circuit. The partitioning algorithm uses Steiner tress for the modeling of net topologies, which allows taking wiring congestion into account during placement. This leads to a more sophisticated balance criterion compared to conventional min-cut algorithms and consequently to a better distribution of active elements and wiring over the chip area. Experimental results show that the application of the new method makes the wiring of designs considerably easier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129917","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Algorithms are also presented for the implementation of simulated annealing, based on a theoretically derived statistical annealing schedule. A negative feedback scheme is described that optimizes the relative weighting between the primary objective term and the penalty function terms in the cost function. A placement refinement method has been developed for rectilinear cells which spaces the cells at a density which avoids the need for post-routing compaction.

The algorithm groups strongly connected components into clusters, and rearranges the clusters into two final subsets with specified sizes. It is known that the grouping operations reduce the complexity and thus improve the results of partitioning very large circuits. However, if the grouping is inappropriate, the partitioning results may degenerate. To prevent degeneration, the authors use a ratio cut approach to do the grouping. By a series of experiments based on the tradeoff between cut capacity and CPU time, the authors determine an optimal value to control the resultant number of groups. Good experimental results have been observed in terms of cut capacity and CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129969","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Identifying the strongly connected subcircuits, the clusters, of the logic can significantly reduce the delay of the circuit and the total interconnection length. Finding such a cluster partition however, is NP-complete. The authors propose a fast heuristic algorithm based on a simple, local criterion. They are able to prove that for highly structured circuits the clusters found by this algorithm correspond with high probability to the 'natural' clusters. An application to large scale real world circuits shows that by this method the number of nets cut is reduced by up to 46% compared to the standard mincut approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129970","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Improvements are presented to the theory of AWE to avoid some inherent limitations of Pade approximation. A discussion is presented of the practical aspects that have arisen in the attempt to use AWE in a simulation program called AWEsim. Results are also presented of AWEsim that clearly demonstrate the advantage of AWE over traditional approaches to circuit simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The library is based on the widely used LINPACK and EISPACK packages for solving linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and linear least-squares problems, but extends their functionality in a number of ways. The major methodology for making the algorithms run faster is to restructure them to perform block matrix operations (e.g., matrix-matrix multiplication) in their inner loops. These block operations may be optimized to exploit the memory hierarchy of a specific architecture. The LAPACK project is also working on new algorithms that yield higher relative accuracy for a variety of linear algebra problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/129995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4012037","conferenceDate":"12-16 Nov. 1990","displayDocTitle":"LAPACK: A portable linear algebra library for high-performance computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LAPACK: A portable linear algebra library for high-performance computers","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00129995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072029S","chronDate":"12-16 Nov. 1990","isNumber":"3622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"297","citationCount":"132","articleId":"129995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
