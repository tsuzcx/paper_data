Dynamic control laws for each agent are proposed with the aid of sigma-processes and results from graph theory. In the second problem, we discuss the design of cooperative control laws such that a group of mobile agents converges to and tracks a target point which moves along a desired trajectory under various communication scenarios. By introducing suitable variable transformations, cooperative control laws are proposed. Since communication delay is inevitable in cooperative control, in each of the above cooperative control problems, we analyze the effect of delayed communication on the proposed controllers. As applications of the proposed results, formation control of wheeled mobile robots is discussed. It is shown that our results can be successfully used to solve formation control problem.

The stability of the closed-loop system requires a real characteristic polynomial to be Hurwitz, while several performance criteria can be satisfied by ensuring that a family of complex polynomials is Hurwitz.

We show that consensus is reached asymptotically for the first two cases if the undirected interaction graph is connected. We further show that consensus is reached asymptotically for the third case if the directed interaction graph has a directed spanning tree and the gain for velocity matching with the group reference velocity is above a certain bound.

Motivated by autonomous aerial vehicle applications, we consider the traveling salesperson problem for the Dubins vehicle (DTSP): given \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n points on a plane, what is the shortest Dubins tour through these points, and what is its length? First, we show that the worst-case length of such a tour grows linearly with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n and we propose a novel algorithm with performance within a constant factor of the optimum for the worst-case point sets. In doing this, we also obtain an upper bound on the optimal length in the classical point-to-point problem. Second, we study a stochastic version of the DTSP where the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n targets are randomly and independently sampled from a uniform distribution.

Third and finally, we study a dynamic version of the DTSP: given a stochastic process that generates target points, is there a policy that guarantees that the number of unvisited points does not diverge over time? If such stable policies exist, what is the minimum expected time that a newly generated target waits before being visited by the vehicle?

The observation costs are added to the running cost of the optimization criterion and the resulting optimal control problem is investigated. Since only part of the observations are available at each time step, the controller has to balance the system performance with the penalty of the requested information (query).

Instead of increasing the size of the population searching the pattern space when the problem dimensionality increases, the sectioned GA approach divides each individual into smaller parts (sections) and subsequently applies the genetic operators on each of these parts. Results from the application of sectioned GA on the problem of automatic morphological analysis are also presented in this article. Morphological analysis is by nature a large scale problem since a great number of words need to be segmented into stems and suffixes.

To find out the secret of robustness in biological systems, many researchers have investigated the system level structure of biological organizations. One of the known structural features that enable biological systems to be robust is modularity. In this paper we study the correlation between modularity structure and robustness in IP networks. We carry out a simulation study to observe resistibility of different topologies, which have different level of modularity structure, against a perturbation created synthetically. The numerical results show that the quantified modularity seems to be more important measure to understand robustness of IP networks than any other common properties such as clustering coefficient, degree distribution, and average path length.","doi":"10.1109/BIMNICS.2007.4610087","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd Bio-Inspired Models of Network, Information and Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd Bio-Inspired Models of Network, Information and Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604672/4610057/04610087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIMNICS.2007.4610087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610057","startPage":"84","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward bio-inspired network robustness - Step 1.

Projects are the core of the practised teaching methodology and are structured in a pedagogical format according to the course programme. The use of the FPGA technology as the most suitable implementation technology for digital design teaching purposes is discussed. The course structure, oriented to the development of real working digital systems, challenges the students and increases their motivation.

We develop the theory and a concrete algorithm to perfectly recover a signal within a subspace, from its nonlinear and nonideal samples. Three alternative formulations of the algorithm are described that provide different insights into the structure of the solution: A series of oblique projections, approximated projections onto convex sets, and quasi-Newton iterations. Using classical analysis techniques of descent-based methods, and recent results on frame perturbation theory, we prove convergence of our algorithm to the true input signal. We demonstrate our method by simulations, and explain the applicability of our theory to Wiener-Hammerstein analog-to-digital hybrid systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Nonlinear distortion","Signal processing algorithms","Signal sampling","Image reconstruction","Analog-digital conversion","Interpolation","Digital signal processing","Sensor systems","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","continuous time systems","Newton method","set theory","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear sampling","nonideal sampling","continuous-time signal","acquisition systems","analog-to-digital converter","convex sets","quasiNewton iterations","descent-based methods","frame perturbation theory","Wiener-Hammerstein analog-to-digital hybrid systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized sampling","interpolation","nonlinear sampling","Wiener\u2013Hammerstein"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04610271.pdf","startPage":"5874","endPage":"5890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear and Nonideal Sampling: Theory and Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear and Nonideal Sampling: Theory and Methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610271/","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610271/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10313335","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear and Nonideal Sampling: Theory and Methods","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-dvorkind-929872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096253S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4610271","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4610272,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper investigates the use of a single calibration emitter, whose position is known to the sensor array, to reduce the loss in localization accuracy due to sensor position errors that are random. Using a Gaussian noise model, we first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for a time difference of arrival (TDOA)-based source location estimate with the use of a calibration source. The differential calibration technique that is commonly used in Global Positioning System through the use of a calibration source to mitigate the inaccuracy in satellite ephemeris data is analyzed. The analysis indicates that differential calibration in most cases cannot reach the CRLB accuracy. The paper then proceeds to propose an algebraic closed-form solution for the source location estimate using both TDOA measurements from the unknown and the calibration source. The proposed algorithm is shown analytically, under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small sensor position noise, or under moderate level of SNR and sensor position noise together with distant unknown and calibration sources, to reach the CRLB accuracy.

However, an important advantage of the developed probability-constrained MV beamformers with respect to their standard worst-case counterparts is that the former approaches enable to explicitly quantify the parameters of the uncertainty region in terms of the beamformer outage probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Relationship Between Robust Minimum Variance Beamformers With Probabilistic and Worst-Case Distortionless Response Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4652320/04610274.pdf","startPage":"5719","endPage":"5724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Relationship Between Robust Minimum Variance Beamformers With Probabilistic and Worst-Case Distortionless Response Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4610274/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265503","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Relationship Between Robust Minimum Variance Beamformers With Probabilistic and Worst-Case Distortionless Response Constraints","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-vorobyov-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098506S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4610274","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4610292,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth E.

In most countries installing the phasor measurement units (PMUs) and getting to know the PMU system behavior through continuous observations of system events has been the first step. All installations are reaching for a hierarchical wide-area measurement system (WAMS ) so that the measurements obtained from various substations on the system can be collected at central locations from which various monitoring, protection, and control applications can be developed. In this article, experts from several countries summarize their WAMS -related activities in some detail.

To this end, the use of the Engset multirate loss model (EnMLM) is proposed in the uplink direction. To apply the EnMLM we need to extend it by incorporating the so called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">local</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">blockings</i>\n. Arriving calls compete for their successful admission to a W-CDMA cell. The call admission depends on the availability of the required channels. To analyze the system, we formulate an aggregate one-dimensional Markov chain, and based on it, we determine the system state probabilities by an efficient recurrent formula. Consequently, we determine the call blocking probabilities in the uplink direction. Although the proposed model is approximate, its accuracy is found to be quite satisfactory. The evaluation is done through simulation. Moreover, the model performs better than the existing model which assumes infinite number of traffic sources in the cell.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call Blocking Probabilities in a W-CDMA cell with fixed number of channels and finite number of traffic sources","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610704","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610704.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Call Blocking Probabilities in a W-CDMA cell with fixed number of channels and finite number of traffic sources","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610704/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10185983","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call Blocking Probabilities in a W-CDMA cell with fixed number of channels and finite number of traffic sources","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"12959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04669S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610711,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaldo Spalvieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Spalvieri","id":"37268261400"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","id":"37268262100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1875-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1876-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4610711","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Transfer functions","Delay","Filtering theory","Phase noise","Equations","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","mean square error methods","minimum shift keying","phase detectors","phase locked loops","phase noise","quadrature phase shift keying","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener loop filter","carrier recovery","offset quadrature phase shift keying","minimum shift keying","AWGN channel","phase detectors","mean square error methods","phase noise"]}],"abstract":"Carrier recovery for offset QPSK (OQPSK) and minimum shift keying (MSK) based on phase-lock loop (PLL) is considered in the paper.

Delay in the loop, which may affect the numerical implementation of the phase-lock loop, is also considered in the paper. Closed-form expressions for the loop filter and for the mean-square error are given for the case where the phase noise is characterized as a first-order process.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610711","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","startPage":"525","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wiener\u2019s loop filter for PLL-based carrier recovery with OQPSK and MSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wiener\u2019s loop filter for PLL-based carrier recovery with OQPSK and MSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610711/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10185990","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4610711/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wiener\u2019s loop filter for PLL-based carrier recovery with OQPSK and MSK","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"20261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.180721S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4610714,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The transport network is formed of optical links between HAPs and optical backhaul uplinks and downlinks between HAPs and ground stations (GSs) hosting gateways to the backbone network. Taking into account the physical constraints imposed by free space optics (FSO) we analyze the number of wavelengths required for full interconnectivity without wavelength conversions in two regular topologies and determine the performance of a representative network with irregular topology using different routing and wavelength assignment algorithms. We show that the number of wavelengths needed to achieve full interconnectivity strongly depends on the physical topology of the network, and that adaptive routing yields better overall performance of the network compared to fixed and fixed alternate routing. The analysis also shows that resources in realistic network topologies tend to be used very inefficiently, which could be improved by traffic engineering solutions or wavelength conversions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4610714/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10185993","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength requirements in optical transport networks based on high-altitude platforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength requirements in optical transport networks based on high-altitude platforms","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"22420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070599S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4610716,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The proposed communication system consists of four major modules: multiple-accessing chaotic transmitter (MACT), frequency modulation (FM) transmitter, FM receiver and multiple-accessing chaotic receiver (MACR). In this multiple-accessing chaotic digital communication system, the transmitted data of every Link are carried in a different state of the chaotic system instead of the using of chaotic sequences spreader or binary codes spreader, and only a scalar state variable (i.e. the output of MACTpsilas chaotic circuit) is sent to the MACRpsilas chaotic circuit through both FM transmitter and FM receiver. For synchronizing the chaotic circuits of the MACT and MACR, an observer-based chaotic synchronization scheme is used in this work. Besides, the Bit Detector in MACR is applied to recover the transmitted input digital bits corresponding to each individual link. Some numerical simulations are executed for the illustrative communication system, which is a Rossler - like chaotic system. Moreover, the performance of bit error rate of the proposed system is compared with those of the correlator-based communication systems adopting coherent binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and coherent differential chaotic shift keying (DCSK) schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610717.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multiple-accessing chaotic digital communication system based on Interleaved Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying (I-CDPK)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Chaos","Synchronization","Receivers","Digital communication","Transmitters","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","digital communication","error statistics","frequency modulation","phase shift keying","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic digital communication","multiple accessing communication","interleaved chaotic differential peaks keying","multiple-accessing chaotic transmitter","frequency modulation transmitter","frequency modulation receiver","chaotic sequences spreader","binary codes spreader","chaotic circuit","chaotic synchronization","numerical simulations","Rossler-like chaotic system","bit error rate","coherent binary phase shift keying","coherent differential chaotic shift keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Access","Chaotic Digital Communication System","Chaotic Modulation","Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying","I-CDPK","BPSK","DCSK","Observer","Chaotic synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of multiple-accessing chaotic digital communication system based on Interleaved Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying (I-CDPK)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610717/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10185996","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multiple-accessing chaotic digital communication system based on Interleaved Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying (I-CDPK)","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"24765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060733S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610721,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The cabling and wired infrastructure to provide several hundred such connections is complex, heavy and makes reconfiguring the airliner seating patterns a time-consuming process. Wireless data transmission to seat-back terminals may therefore be advantageous and optical wireless may be an attractive means to achieve this. In this paper we report measurements and simulations of the optical wireless channel inside a mock-up of a commercial airliner cabin. These indicate that careful control of illumination and receiver field of view can create channels with the bandwidths likely to be required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High data-rate optical wireless communications in passenger aircraft: Measurements and simulations","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610733","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610733.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"High data-rate optical wireless communications in passenger aircraft: Measurements and simulations","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610733/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High data-rate optical wireless communications in passenger aircraft: Measurements and simulations","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"33414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06279S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610737,"authors":[{"name":"Lucy J.

The simple filter design without optimizations has sharp transition, good stopband attenuation with less filter complexity. An uniform linear array beamformer with a narrow transition bandwidth and low side lobes is synthesized with fewer sensor elements. This is achieved by using the proposed filters as subfilters in the frequency response masking approach. Precise and independent specification of main beamwidth and side lobe level for the beamformer is possible.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610737","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610737.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610737","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","startPage":"247","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel design of sharp transition FIR filter for digital beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel design of sharp transition FIR filter for digital beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610737/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186014","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel design of sharp transition FIR filter for digital beamforming","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"34979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053581S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4610743,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

However, an appreciable high availability of the link is the basic requirement of any communication application. Free space optics (FSO) links are highly weather dependent and fog is the major attenuating factor reducing the link availability. Hybrid networks consisting of free space optics (FSO) link and back up link in the GHz frequency range renders high availability besides providing comparable data rates. The back up link should be nearly immune to fog attenuation for achieving carrier class availability. In this paper effects of fog on FSO and GHz frequency range links are studied so that frequencies with best complementary behaviour can be selected as a back up link.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610745","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610745.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing the fog effects on hybrid network using optical wireless and GHz links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610745/","displayDocTitle":"Comparing the fog effects on hybrid network using optical wireless and GHz links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186022","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610745/","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing the fog effects on hybrid network using optical wireless and GHz links","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"41250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04799S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610750,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Pimenta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Pimenta","id":"37673347300"},{"name":"Izzat Darwazeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Izzat","lastName":"Darwazeh","id":"37281888400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1875-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1876-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4610750","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fiber optics","Optical fibers","Optical signal processing","Adaptive optics","Optical filters","High speed optical techniques","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","signal processing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic signal processing","optical code division multiple access networks","distributed topologies","time-domain optical CDMA signals","multi-wavelength optical CDMA signals","group velocity dispersion"]}],"abstract":"This work demonstrates the potential of electronic signal processing for applications in optical code division multiple access networks.

POW offers several advantages over radio technologies, making it an attractive solution for home networks. Orthogonal modulations such as OFDM are currently used in many radio transmission standards. Among these modulations, OFDM/OQAM is an interesting alternative to classical OFDM, as it does not require the use of guard interval and it has an optimal spectral efficiency. In this paper, over a diffuse infrared channel based on experimental measurements, and with a modified scheme adaptable to optical system constraints, we investigate the combination of OFDM/OQAM and POW technology. Using intensity modulation and direct detection, we show that our modified OFDM/OQAM system increases the bit rate of POW communications, mitigates the effects of inter symbol interference (ISI), and could outperform conventional OFDM schemes with cyclic-prefix.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610752","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610752.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffuse Infrared Personal optical wireless based on modified OFDM/OQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610752/","displayDocTitle":"Diffuse Infrared Personal optical wireless based on modified OFDM/OQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610752/","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffuse Infrared Personal optical wireless based on modified OFDM/OQAM","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"44574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0463S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610758,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The maximum-likelihood (ML) solution derived in this paper closes this gap. However, the latter provides a set of two nonlinear vector equations, which might be simplified only for modulation schemes with constant envelope like M-ary PSK. For signals with nonconstant envelope, like 16-QAM as most prominent example in this respect, a much less complex approach based on the expectation-maximization (EM) principle is developed in this paper. In the medium SNR range, this bridges part of the performance gap mentioned previously. Over the full SNR range, we propose a hybrid algorithm, where the EM estimate is replaced by a moment-based method as soon as the true SNR drops below a predefined threshold.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610773.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML and EM algorithm for non-data-aided SNR estimation of linearly modulated signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Artificial neural networks","Modulation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Evolution (biology)","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao lower bound","signal-to-noise ratio","nondata-aided SNR estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","expectation-maximisation estimation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital modulation","SNR estimation","maximum-likelihood solution","expectation-maximization algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"ML and EM algorithm for non-data-aided SNR estimation of linearly modulated signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186049","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML and EM algorithm for non-data-aided SNR estimation of linearly modulated signals","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"58243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070698S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610777,"authors":[{"name":"Trung Thanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"lastName":"Trung Thanh Nguyen","id":"38184426800"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1875-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1876-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4610777","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610777","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Hamming distance","Gallium","Constellation diagram","Modulation","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","error correction codes","Gaussian processes","optical communication","pulse position modulation","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communications","multipulse pulse-position modulation","error-correcting codes","capacity-maximized MPPM constellations","constellation-constrained channel capacity","Poisson regime","Gaussian regime","photon detection FSO channel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610777","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610777.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-maximized MPPM constellations for free-space optical communications","abstract":"Multipulse pulse-position modulation (MPPM) is a preferred signaling scheme for free-space optical (FSO) communications under certain constraints.

For a comparison, we consider distributed space time block codes (DSTBC). As expected, DSTBC perform poorly when source-relay channels have low SNR, thus, an error floor is reached.

A recently proposed method uses the decoding result to request unreliable bits for retransmission (reliability-based Hybrid ARQ). Commonly, Belief Propagation is used to decode LDPC codes. The result of this algorithm naturally provides an estimate for the probability of a bit to be erroneous. Another possibility to decode LDPC codes is via linear programming (LP) decoding. Despite some drawbacks (e.g. in terms of implementation complexity), linear programming decoding provides an interesting alternative to Belief Propagation. This work investigates the feasibility of combining LP decoding with ARQ. In lack of a probability measure for the decoded bits, when using LP decoding, request criteria using the integrality of the values in the LP solution are proposed. We present statistical investigations on the proposed criteria and the results of throughput simulations demonstrating the gains achievable by the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610781","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","startPage":"535","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LP decoding of LDPC codes in HARQ systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LP decoding of LDPC codes in HARQ systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610781/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186056","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4610781/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LP decoding of LDPC codes in HARQ systems","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"63383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035726S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610784,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Ertug","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Ertug","id":"38189414100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1875-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1876-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4610784","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic ergodic capacity of multidimensional vector-sensor array MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610784","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Barium","Copper","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Artificial intelligence","Fault currents","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","fading channels","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","probability","sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic ergodic capacity","multidimensional vector-sensor array","MIMO channels","dual-polarized antennas","channels identification","multiple independently-fading","free probability theory","antenna locus aspect ratio","average symbol SNR","cross-polar discrimination","multiple-input multiple-output communication techniques","signal to noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"We analyze asymptotic ergodic capacity of multidimensional vector-sensor array MIMO (PMD-MIMO) channels established by the use of dual-polarized antennas in the form of 1D, 2D and/or 3D MIMO arrays.

This paper presents an analog front-end receiver that is designed to overcome challenges faced by high-speed optical wireless links requiring wide field-of-view (FOV), high dynamic range imaging receivers for signal acquisition/ tracking. This receiver employs a capacitive feedback transimpedance amplifier (TIA), with a self-biased automatic gain control (AGC) circuit to increase the input dynamic range. The receiver is designed for integration with wide FOV detectors with associated capacitance up to 5 pF and its performance is insensitive (within 5%) to an order of magnitude variation in input capacitance. The self-biased AGC allows 42 dB dynamic range in received optical power to accommodate varying link ranges and different OW system configurations. The receiver achieves a maximum gain of 52 dBOmega, -3 dB bandwidth of 523 MHz at 5 pF input capacitance, and variable TIA gain from 52 dBOmega to 32 dBOmega without instability. The input referred noise is 18.6 pA/radic(Hz) for 5 pF input capacitance. The front-end receiver is implemented in a 0.5 mum CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.06 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n not including pads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analog front-end receiver with desensitization to input capacitance for free space optical communication","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610802","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610802.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An analog front-end receiver with desensitization to input capacitance for free space optical communication","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610802/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186075","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analog front-end receiver with desensitization to input capacitance for free space optical communication","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"81415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044065S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4610804,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In such networks, the distinction between the new and the handoff traffic is very important. A simple CAC scheme can distinguish the calls between the two traffic types by setting different thresholds for call admission. This simple CAC scheme is evaluated in respect of blocking probabilities of both new and handoff calls. To this end, we formulate an aggregate Markov chain, which describes both the new-call and handoff-call arrival processes, under the assumption that they are both Poisson processes. Based on this Markov chain we derive recurrent and computationally efficient formulas for the calculation of the system state probabilities. Consequently, we calculate the new-call and handoff-call blocking probabilities. The analytical results are verified through simulation and found to be absolutely satisfactory.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599592/4610700/04610806.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a call admission control scheme in W-CDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Probability","Spread spectrum communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Simulation","Analytical models","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","Markov processes","probability","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["call admission control","W-CDMA cellular networks","multiple service-classes","handoff traffic","call blocking probability","aggregate Markov chain","Poisson processes","CAC scheme","new-call arrival processes","handoff-call arrival processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a call admission control scheme in W-CDMA cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610806/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186079","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a call admission control scheme in W-CDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"82966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059107S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599592","isNumber":"4610700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599592","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4610700","articleId":"4610806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610813,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The purpose is to develop a networked sensor for static, full-axis deformation of large and long structures such as bridges, roads, and railways. We propose a novel technique based on the combined use of an optical vortex (OV) beam and correlation image sensors (CIS). Since the beam profile of OV involves definitive features known as zeros or phase singularities and they are invariant through propagation, we can encode and transmit information to determine geometrical relations between the sender and receiver nodes. By demodulating an amplitude and phase profile of OV using the CIS, all (three lateral and three rotational) displacement components can be determined. The basic optical setup is presented and the results of the fundamental experiments are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Networked Sensing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607201/4610837/04610894.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Networked Sensing Systems","doi":"10.1109/INSS.2008.4610894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INSS.2008.4610894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical vortex and correlation image sensor for networked deformation sensing of infrastructures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical beams","Optical vortices","Measurement by laser beam","Laser beams","Displacement measurement","Optical sensors","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","demodulation","distributed sensors","image sensors","optical correlation","optical vortices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical vortex beam","correlation image sensor","networked infrastructure deformation sensing","structure health monitoring","demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["structure health monitoring","optical vortex beam","correlation image sensor","displacement measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optical vortex and correlation image sensor for networked deformation sensing of infrastructures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4610894/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10186357","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical vortex and correlation image sensor for networked deformation sensing of infrastructures","confLoc":"IKanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050738S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607201","isNumber":"4610837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607201","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4610837","articleId":"4610894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE (The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers)IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4610926,"authors":[{"name":"Einar Halvorsen","affiliation":["Institute of Microsystem Technology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Vestfold University College, Horten, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4636779/4610926/4610926-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Einar Halvorsen (M'03) received the Siv.Ing. degree in physical electronics from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), Trondheim, Norway, in 1991, and the Dr.Ing. degree in physics from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 1996.","He has worked both in academia and the microelectronics industry.

This substantially enhances the versatility of the device by providing the means to apply independent electrical biases to two separate parts of the structure. Here, we demonstrate a joint magnetic spin-valve (SV)/tunnel junction structure sharing a common free layer nanomagnet contacted by this third electrode. A spatially nonuniform spin-polarized current flowing into the free layer via the low-resistance SV path can reverse the magnetic orientation of the free layer as a consequence of the spin-torque (ST) effect, by nucleating a reversal domain at the spin injection site that propagates across the free layer. The free layer magnetic state can then be read out separately via the higher resistance magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This three-terminal structure provides a strategy for developing high-performance ST magnetic random access memory (ST-MRAM) cells, which avoids the need to apply a large voltage across a MTJ during the writing step, thereby enhancing device reliability, while retaining the benefits of a high-impedance MTJ for read-out.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2005187","startPage":"190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4799383/04610963.pdf","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2005187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610963/","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Terminal Approach to Developing Spin-Torque Written Magnetic Random Access Memory Cells","volume":"8","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4610963/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10505216","publicationDate":"March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Terminal Approach to Developing Spin-Torque Written Magnetic Random Access Memory Cells","sourcePdf":"tnano-braganca-2005187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103997S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4799383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4799383","articleId":"4610963","onlineDate":"03 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4610965,"authors":[{"name":"Harish Bhaskaran","affiliation":["Zurich Research Laboratory, International Business Machines Corporation, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Harish","lastName":"Bhaskaran","id":"37697979500"},{"name":"Abu Sebastian","affiliation":["Zurich Research Laboratory, International Business Machines Corporation, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Abu","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37320446800"},{"name":"Michel Despont","affiliation":["Zurich Research Laboratory, International Business Machines Corporation, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Despont","id":"37267355500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-125X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0085"}],"articleNumber":"4610965","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":401},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"}],"abstract":"A method to improve the conduction and wear properties of nanometric conducting tips by forming silicides of Pt at the tip apex is presented.

Nowadays, increasing attention has turned to cellular systems with relays, but only a few algorithms have been designed for OFDMA-based relay systems. In this paper, resource-allocation schemes are proposed for the cases of one relay station (RS) and multiple RSs in the cell. Due to the specific design of these algorithms, which operate in an RS-aided base station centralized manner, the amount of required channel-state information and algorithm complexity are minimized, making them suited for practical use.

In particular, we consider a type of beamforming with a maximum ratio transmission/maximum ratio combining (MRT-MRC) transceiver structure. For this system, we derive a central limit theorem for various block-based performance metrics. This motivates an accurate Gaussian approximation to the system data rate and the number of outages per OFDM block. In addition to the data rate and outage distributions, we also consider the subcarrier signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a process in the frequency domain and compute level crossing rates (LCRs) and average fade bandwidths (AFBs). Hence, we provide fundamental but novel results for the MIMO OFDM channel. The accuracy of these results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations, and applications to performance analysis and system design are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Based Performance Measures for MIMO OFDM Beamforming Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2005102","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04610969.pdf","startPage":"2236","endPage":"2248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2005102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4610969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4610969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","displayDocTitle":"Block-Based Performance Measures for MIMO OFDM Beamforming Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4610969/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Based Performance Measures for MIMO OFDM Beamforming Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kongara-2005102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101796S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4610969","onlineDate":"03 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4610971,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Bai","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Laboratory (WCRL) Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, Swansea, U.K."],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Bai","id":"37590586800"},{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Laboratory (WCRL) Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, Swansea, U.K."],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4610971","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Silicon carbide","Maximum likelihood detection","Interference cancellation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Receiving antennas","Detection algorithms","Detectors","Transmitting antennas","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","partial maximum a posteriori probability","multiple-input-multiple-output detection","successive interference cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference cancellation","list decoding","maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detection","maximum likelihood (ML) detection","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) system","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space\u2013time (V-BLAST)"]}],"abstract":"The partial maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">posteriori</i>\n probability (PMAP) principle can be applied to reduce the complexity of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) detection through the successive interference cancellation (SIC).

The key point of the amplifier is the source degeneration with resistive shunt series feedback and the load circuit based on combined parallel-series resonance circuit. The voltage gain of the amplifier is 11 dB, the matching is better than -10 dB, the noise figure lies between 3.2 and 4 dB in the whole frequency range. The value of CP1dB is -15 dB at the frequency near the amplitude response maximum 7.6 GHz. The amplifier consumes the power of 11.5 mW from the voltage supply 1.8 V.

Some natures of WBT MIMO systems and the data transmission scheme are discussed theoretically, and two types of signal processing structure, i.e., a spatio-temporal beamformer with and without the cascade connection of a one-dimensional (1-D) FIR filter are proposed for the equalization of WBT MIMO channel. Transmission characteristics in the frequency-domain are obtained through a measurement in a radio anechoic chamber, and computer simulations are carried out using them.

The mean square error and the complexity of different estimators are analyzed analytically, while an actual ASIC implementation allows to assess the real-world silicon area requirements for our proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM channel estimation algorithm and ASIC implementation","publicationTitle":"2008 4th European Conference on Circuits and Systems for Communications","doi":"10.1109/ECCSC.2008.4611691","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th European Conference on Circuits and Systems for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604652/4611637/04611691.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCSC.2008.4611691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4611637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4611691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4611691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDM channel estimation algorithm and ASIC implementation","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4611691/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203660","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM channel estimation algorithm and ASIC implementation","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053433S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604652","isNumber":"4611637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604652","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4611637","articleId":"4611691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4611693,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Yuan Yang","id":"37694983800"},{"name":"Mong-Kai Ku","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mong-Kai Ku","id":"37353792000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2419-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2420-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4611693","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"abstract":"This paper investigates efficient low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation schemes for fixed wireless application.

In this paper, we consider an oversampled OFDM system which is a special case of the precoded OFDM systems. We show that the system performance is significantly improved if the deep faded symbols on the subcarriers of each oversampled OFDM signal are discarded and then reconstructed from the remaining ones. In fact, dropping the weak symbols at the receive side results in a nonuniform sampled version of the oversampled OFDM signal and as the nonuniform sampling theorem guarantees, as long as the average symbol rate of the symbols on the remaining subcarriers stays above the Nyquist rate, the perfect OFDM signal recovery is possible. For reconstructing the symbols on the weak subcarriers from the symbols on the remaining subcarriers at the receiver, we consider an iterative receiver for its fast convergence rate and its simple implementation. Simulation results reveal the oversampled OFDM system performance valuable merits as compared to that of the conventional detector for the OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/ECCSC.2008.4611695","publicationTitle":"2008 4th European Conference on Circuits and Systems for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th European Conference on Circuits and Systems for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604652/4611637/04611695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCSC.2008.4611695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4611637","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative reconstruction of oversampled OFDM signals over deep fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4611695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative reconstruction of oversampled OFDM signals over deep fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4611695/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203664","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4611695/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative reconstruction of oversampled OFDM signals over deep fading channels","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046078S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604652","isNumber":"4611637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604652","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4611637","articleId":"4611695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4611696,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Andrei Perisoara","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunication and Information Technology,Applied Electronics and Information Enginnering Departament, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian Andrei","lastName":"Perisoara","id":"38188911800"},{"name":"Mihai Neghina","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconducteurs, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Neghina","id":"37546450900"},{"name":"Rodica Stoian","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunication and Information Technology,Applied Electronics and Information Enginnering Departament, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Rodica","lastName":"Stoian","id":"38185969400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2419-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2420-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4611696","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel capacity","concatenated codes","convolutional codes","error correction codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output communication systems","MIMO systems","OFDM systems","channel capacity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","forward error correcting codes","block codes","convolutional codes","concatenated codes","QAM constellations","Rayleigh flat fading channels","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems are used to increase the channel capacity or the data rate for a particular connection through multiplexing or to improve performance through diversity.

The case considered here is an infinite slab subjected to an external ac magnetic field. This problem can be modeled by a 1-D partial differential equation (diffusion equation). This relatively simple case allowed investigating the influence of the various parameters in a reasonable time. The findings of this work can be used as a starting point for optimizing the numerical settings of more complex models. As the main results, it is shown that choosing first-order elements for approximating the flux density ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n) is the most stable option, and that using high order adaptive time-stepping methods provides good accuracy and fast simulations. A new and simple self-check test for validating the computed ac losses is also proposed. Finally, a detailed analysis about the behavior of the numerical solution near flux/current fronts is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2008.2001740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/4616531/04616550.pdf","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2008.2001740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Considerations About Using Finite-Element Methods to Compute AC Losses in HTS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616550/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Considerations About Using Finite-Element Methods to Compute AC Losses in HTS","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185868","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616550/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Considerations About Using Finite-Element Methods to Compute AC Losses in HTS","sourcePdf":"tasc-sirois-2001740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062838S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4616531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4616531","articleId":"4616550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4616626,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The best known algorithm used to solve ECDLP is Pollardpsilas rho method.

The ANN FPGA design presented here facilitates dynamic network structure and parameter changes required for intrinsic training of artificial neural networks, without reliance on runtime FPGA reconfigurations.

In this paper, we propose a parallel genetic algorithm in which the 3-D rectilinear Steiner tree with bounded number of bends is obtained by replacing each edge of the given Euclidean spanning tree by the segments which are parallel to the X-axis, the Y-axis, or the Z-axis. In the proposed method, the algorithm can avoid obstacles flexibly by using, at most, three bends to replace one edge of the Euclidean spanning tree. For the fitness value, a linear sum of the wire length and diameter of the rectilinear Steiner tree is used. In the experimental results, it is shown that our parallel genetic algorithm can avoid obstacles, and obtain the 3-D rectilinear Steiner tree with bounded number of bends.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616743","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616743.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel genetic algorithm for 3-D rectilinear Steiner tree with bounded number of bends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616743/","displayDocTitle":"A parallel genetic algorithm for 3-D rectilinear Steiner tree with bounded number of bends","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203248","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616743/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel genetic algorithm for 3-D rectilinear Steiner tree with bounded number of bends","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"023_5112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049971S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4616748,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Saxena","affiliation":["E.C.E.

The XtremeData XD1000 is one available system that addresses the first challenge by coupling the reconfigurable hardware with the host muP on a dual-core Opteron motherboard. The ImpulseC development environment, addresses the challenge of portability and programmability by enabling development of applications in C that are capable of targeting multiple reconfigurable hardware platforms. We present a workflow methodology for accelerating a production-level biomolecular simulation framework called LAMMPS in ImpulseC.

This feature can be used to overcome the multi-tone signal detection limitation of the DFT/FFT. The paper demonstrates that by externally controlling the frequency resolution of the WDFT in an intelligent manner, multi-tone signals can be more readily detected and classified. Furthermore, the WDFT can be built upon an FFT enabled framework, insuring high efficiency and bandwidths.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616791.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Muti-tone detection using the warped discrete fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency control","Finite impulse response filter","Signal resolution","Filter bank","Filtering theory","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["warped discrete Fourier transform","multi-tone signal detection technology","WDFT","FFT","frequency resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Muti-tone detection using the warped discrete fourier transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616791/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10186773","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muti-tone detection using the warped discrete fourier transform","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"071_5274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069745S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616802,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Suzuki","affiliation":["Laboratory for Brainware Systems, Research Institute of Eletrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Daisuke Suzuki","id":"37313956200"},{"name":"Tetsuo Endoh","affiliation":["Information Devices Devision, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Tetsuo Endoh","id":"37319060700"},{"name":"Takahiro Hanyu","affiliation":["Laboratory for Brainware Systems, Research Institute of Eletrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Takahiro Hanyu","id":"37069285400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2166-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2167-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4616802","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TMR-logic-based LUT for quickly wake-up FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616802.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616802","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Barium","Table lookup","Nonvolatile memory","MOSFETs","CMOS integrated circuits","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","magnetoresistive devices","MOSFET","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TMR-logic-based LUT","quickly wake-up FPGA","look-up-table circuit","tunneling magnetoresistive devices","MOS transistors","power-aware FPGA","field programmable gate array","standby mode","variable resistor","logic functions","TMR-based logic-circuit structure","circuit-configuration information","dynamic current-mode circuitry","dynamic power dissipation","arithmetic-circuit design","switching delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616802","abstract":"A new look-up-table (LUT) circuit combined with tunneling magneto-resistive (TMR) devices and MOS transistors is proposed for a power-aware FPGA, where the standby mode can be quickly changed to the active one. Since a TMR device is regarded as a variable resistor, any logic functions with external inputs and one-bit stored input can be performed by series and/or parallel connection of TMR devices and MOS transistors, which achieves a compact circuit implementation. The use of TMR-based logic-circuit structure makes circuit-configuration information still maintained without external nonvolatile memory even if the power supply is cut off, which realizes an instant standby/active-state capability. The combination of a dynamic current-mode circuitry and the TMR-based logic network also makes it possible to greatly reduce the dynamic power dissipation. A typical arithmetic-circuit design example using the proposed LUTs is discussed, and its advantages in terms of device counts, switching delay and power dissipation are demonstrated in comparison with a corresponding SRAM-based FPGA with external nonvolatile memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203291","htmlLink":"/document/4616802/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TMR-logic-based LUT for quickly wake-up FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TMR-logic-based LUT for quickly wake-up FPGA","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"082_5303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074696S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616814,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic Maurath","affiliation":["Chair of Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Maurath","id":"37268653700"},{"name":"Fridolin Michel","affiliation":["Chair of Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Fridolin","lastName":"Michel","id":"37700148000"},{"name":"Maurits Ortmanns","affiliation":["Chair of Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Maurits","lastName":"Ortmanns","id":"37270110800"},{"name":"Yiannos Manoli","affiliation":["Chair of Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Yiannos","lastName":"Manoli","id":"37270096500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2166-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2167-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4616814","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Delta modulation","Logic gates","Transistors","Robustness","CMOS integrated circuits","Differential amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS amplifier","micro-energy harvesting","differential amplifier design","single ended amplifier design","PMOS transistors","voltage 0.5 V","power 1.5 muW","size 0.35 mum","gain 90 dB","capacitance 10 pF","bandwidth 100 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616814","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616814.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0:5V rail-to-rail 1.5 \u03bcW CMOS amplifier for micro-energy harvesting applications","abstract":"This paper presents a fully differential and single ended amplifier design in a standard 0.35 mum CMOS twin well process, targeted to ultra low voltage applications down to 0.5 V.

A nine transistor (9T) cell at a 32 nm feature size in CMOS is proposed to accomplish improvements in stability, power dissipation and performance compared with previous designs for low-power memory operation. Initially, this paper presents the optimal transistor sizing for this 9T SRAM cell considering stability, energy consumption, and delay. A write bitline balancing scheme is proposed to reduce the leakage current of the SRAM cell. By optimizing size and employing the proposed write circuitry scheme, a saving of 32% in power dissipation is achieved in memory array operation compared with a conventional 6T SRAM based design. The impact of process variations is investigated in detail, and the HSPICE simulation shows that the 9T SRAM cell has an excellent tolerance to process variations.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616826","startPage":"422","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616826","endPage":"425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32nm SRAM design for low power and high stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 32nm SRAM design for low power and high stability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616826/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10186781","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32nm SRAM design for low power and high stability","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"106_5215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028703S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4616827,"authors":[{"name":"Afshin Nourivand","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Nourivand","id":"37688739300"},{"name":"Asim J.

Source-biasing of cells during standby mode reduces leakage currents significantly. However, to ensure reliable data-retention during standby mode, source-bias voltage should not exceed a critical voltage, called optimum source bias voltage (OSBV). Due to process variations and weak defects, OSBV exhibits an intra-die distribution. Existing leakage reduction techniques choose a worst-case approach by using a source-bias voltage smaller than the lowest OSBV among all cells in an SRAM array. In contrast, we propose raising source-bias voltage beyond worst-case and counter the ensuing unreliability using error checking and correcting (ECC) techniques. In this work, we first model OSBV distribution in the presence of process variations and weak defects. Then, probabilistic models are developed to explore trade-offs between power reduction and overhead of the ECC scheme. It is shown that using conventional single error correcting Hamming codes, leakage is reduced up to 50% compared to that of the worst-case approach.","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616827.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggressive leakage reduction of SRAMs using error checking and correcting (ECC) techniques","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Aggressive leakage reduction of SRAMs using error checking and correcting (ECC) techniques","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10186782","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4616827/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggressive leakage reduction of SRAMs using error checking and correcting (ECC) techniques","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"107_5296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039903S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616830,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Its power consumption is reduced to 42% compared to synchronous architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power field-programmable VLSI based on a fine-grained power-gating scheme","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616896","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616896.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A low-power field-programmable VLSI based on a fine-grained power-gating scheme","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616896/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203364","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power field-programmable VLSI based on a fine-grained power-gating scheme","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"176_5221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054147S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616897,"authors":[{"name":"Nobukazu Takai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Gunma University, Gunma, Japan"],"lastName":"Nobukazu Takai","id":"37370669500"},{"name":"Yukihiro Fujimura","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Gunma University, Gunma, Japan"],"lastName":"Yukihiro Fujimura","id":"38092222500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2166-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2167-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4616897","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616897","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Generators","Regulators","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling","Oscillators","Discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage regulators","waveform generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triangular waves","switching regulator","duty ratio","sawtooth wave generator","oscillation frequency error","Spectre simulations"]}],"abstract":"Switching regulator is used in many electronics devices because of its small size and low power consumption.

In this paper, method to realize sawtooth wave generator which has slight fall time, less amplitude error, and less oscillation frequency error compared with conventional circuit, is proposed.

We synthesized our VLSI architectures using a 0.18 mu standard cell library. The final VLSI design combines polyphase decimated FIR filters to reduce power dissipation, pipelined computational cells for higher throughput, and data-interleaving for lower chip area. An analytical comparison with other existing DWT implementations illustrates a two fold improvement in throughput for the proposed architecture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Finite impulse response filter","Computer architecture","Power dissipation","Hardware","Throughput","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","FIR filters","optimisation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","1D convolutional discrete wavelet transform","optimizations","FIR filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616938","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616938","startPage":"870","endPage":"873","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616938.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616938/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient VLSI implementation for the 1D convolutional discrete wavelet transform","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10203396","htmlLink":"/document/4616938/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient VLSI implementation for the 1D convolutional discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"218_5220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041699S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616942,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad S.

Hardware implementation of these networks, often using a backpropagation algorithm for learning, has many advantages over software implementation, the main advantage being speedup due to taking advantage of the inherent parallelism of neural networks. However, tradeoffs are often introduced with respect to speed, area, precision, and other factors. Moreover, many of the calculations involve multiplications, which can be costly and complex to implement in custom hardware. This paper proposes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that can be used to replace multiplications with a series of shifts and additions. This, combined with the same approximation for the nonlinear activation function and its derivative, results in a neural network realization in which all arithmetic and function computations are carried out using adders only.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616944","startPage":"894","endPage":"897","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616944.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A backpropagation neural network design using adder-only arithmetic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","backpropagation","digital arithmetic","feedforward neural nets","neural chips","nonlinear functions","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network design","adder-only arithmetic","feedforward neural networks","recurrent neural networks","machine learning","backpropagation algorithm","piecewise linear approximation architecture","nonlinear activation function approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A backpropagation neural network design using adder-only arithmetic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616944/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203400","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A backpropagation neural network design using adder-only arithmetic","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"224_5185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066012S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616949,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Oshima","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Takashi Oshima","id":"38183037800"},{"name":"Tomomi Takahashi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Tomomi Takahashi","id":"37087850066"},{"name":"Taizo Yamawaki","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Taizo Yamawaki","id":"37087738575"},{"name":"Cheonguyen Tsang","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Cheonguyen Tsang","id":"37087846009"},{"name":"Dusan Stepanovic","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Stepanovic","id":"37688757200"},{"name":"Borivoje Nikolic","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Borivoje","lastName":"Nikolic","id":"37268296200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2166-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2167-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4616949","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616949","abstract":"The high-speed and high-resolution ADC is a key enabler for many future wireless communications systems.

Although division and square root are relatively infrequent operations in traditional general-purpose applications, they are indispensable and becoming increasingly important in many modern applications. In this paper, a fused floating-point multiply/divide/square root unit using the Taylor-series expansion algorithm with reduced lookup tables is presented. The implementation results of the proposed fused unit based on standard cell methodology in IBM 90 nm technology exhibits that the incorporation of square root function to an existing multiply/divide unit requires only a modest 20% area increase and the same low latency for divide and square root operation can be achieved (12 cycles). The proposed arithmetic unit also exhibits a reasonably good area-performance balance.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616959","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616959.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","startPage":"954","endPage":"957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Floating-point division and square root implementation using a Taylor-series expansion algorithm with reduced look-up tables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4616959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Floating-point division and square root implementation using a Taylor-series expansion algorithm with reduced look-up tables","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616959/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203413","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4616959/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Floating-point division and square root implementation using a Taylor-series expansion algorithm with reduced look-up tables","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"239_5188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055108S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4616962,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Gestner","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Gestner","id":"37590866000"},{"name":"David V.

Toward the VLSI implementation of lattice reduction algorithms, we address the integer-rounding operation present in these algorithms. In particular we exploit the reciprocal-reuse of a complex-valued lattice reduction algorithm, the Complex Lenstra, Lenstra, Lovasz (CLLL) algorithm, by employing the reciprocation-based Newton-Raphson iteration technique. We derive an easily-computed upper-bound of the relative quotient error for a given reciprocal table size. In addition we show how the CLLL algorithm contains part of the rounding error detection operations necessary for Newton-Raphson-based methods. Application of this analysis results in an area-efficient hardware architecture for FPGAs that requires a small reciprocal look-up table. Implementation results on both Xilinx Virtex4 and Virtex5 FPGAs show that our approach exhibits slightly smaller average latency and requires 40% less equivalent gates than a comparison architecture constructed from existing IP blocks.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616962","startPage":"966","endPage":"969","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603800/4616714/04616962.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 51st Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2008.4616962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single newton-raphson iteration for integer-rounded divider for lattice reduction algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Algorithm design and analysis","Lattices","Receivers","Hardware","Equalizers","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","diversity reception","equalisers","error detection","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","Newton-Raphson method","roundoff errors","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single reciprocation-based Newton-Raphson iteration technique","integer-rounded divider","complex-valued lattice reduction algorithm reciprocal-reuse","MIMO transmissions lattice reduction-aided equalizers","low-complexity method","receiver diversity","VLSI implementation","complex Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm","relative quotient error","reciprocal table size","rounding error detection operations","hardware architecture","Virtex5 FPGA","reciprocal look-up table","Xilinx Virtex4 FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4616962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Single newton-raphson iteration for integer-rounded divider for lattice reduction algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4616962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203416","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single newton-raphson iteration for integer-rounded divider for lattice reduction algorithms","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"242_5342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055431S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603800","isNumber":"4616714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603800","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4616714","articleId":"4616962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4616998,"authors":[{"name":"Mamatha Samson","affiliation":["Center for VLSI and Embedded System Technologies, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Mamatha","lastName":"Samson","id":"38229688200"},{"name":"M.

We employed a quenching observation method [1] where intensity of fluorescent dyes around CNTs is decreased due to the energy transfer. By the quenching observation method, CNTs can be observed continuously for a long time by adding new fluorescent reagent after fluorescence photobleaching. However, we have to adjust its density around CNTs and it is extremely difficult to control proper condition of the reagent. Hence we built up a supplying system of fluorescent reagent in a microfluidic chip. We have found that a porous structured of PDMS could absorb fluorescent reagent as a carrier and supply reagent in high and equivalent density for a long time. In experiment, by using a micro-stirrer, we could mix a different couple of fluids uniformly and succeeded in controlling density of fluorescent reagent. Also, we have applied dielectrophoretic force for trapping of CNTs. The material for electrodes is ITO (Indium Tin Oxide). ITO is suitable for manipulation and observation of CNTs under an optical microscope because of its high conductive property and good transparency. In experiment, we trapped and observed CNTs by using quenching on the chip and confirmed that the fluorescent image of the CNTs was clearer than the bright-field image of them.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2008.92","pdfPath":"/iel5/4616981/4616982/04617074.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2008.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616982","endPage":"294","startPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Using Microfluidic Chip Under Optical Microscope","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617074/","displayDocTitle":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Using Microfluidic Chip Under Optical Microscope","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617074/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10186959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Using Microfluidic Chip Under Optical Microscope","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"S05P21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054715S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4616981","isNumber":"4616982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4616981","xplore-issue":"4616982","articleId":"4617074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4617083,"authors":[{"name":"A.

PCM cell stores data by a thermally induced phase transition between crystalline to amorphous states, and thus understanding of temperature distributes within a cell and determining the programming current of phase transition are crucial in design and technology of PCM. In this study, a three-dimensional electro-thermal time-domain simulation is conducted for dynamic analysis of the cylindrical-shaped PCMs. The structure GST is a cone with different cone angle, ranging from 90deg to 45deg. The relation between contact size of nanoscale GeSbTe (GST) alloy and the required programming current for phase transition is advanced. The preliminary result shows that the GST structure with a 90deg angle exhibits the smallest required programming current, the fastest phase transition characteristic, the highest resistance contrast, and the best heat utilization efficiency. This study quantitatively estimates the structure effect on phase transition of PCM and physically provides an insight into design and technology of PCMs.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2008.109","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4616981/4616982/04617091.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2008.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure Effect of Cylindrical-Shaped GeSbTe Alloy on Phase Transition in Phase Change Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617091/","displayDocTitle":"Structure Effect of Cylindrical-Shaped GeSbTe Alloy on Phase Transition in Phase Change Memory","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617091/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10186961","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure Effect of Cylindrical-Shaped GeSbTe Alloy on Phase Transition in Phase Change Memory","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"S06P14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04142S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4616981","isNumber":"4616982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4616981","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616982","articleId":"4617091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4617123,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Conventionally this is achieved by generating the signals at 300 K, transmitting them along very long coaxial cables that span ges 4 m from 300 K to sub-K (30-500 mK) into a dilution refrigerator, and reading-out the final qubit states via similar lengths of cable. Here we fabricate the control-pulse generator circuits using a foundry-processed SOS-CMOS technology that is capable of operation down to sub-K temperatures so that control signals can be generated at cryogenic temperatures in the near vicinity of the qubits. We present two full-custom large-scale integrated (LSI) control-pulse generator circuits: (a) a mixed-mode; and (b) a digital design each comprising hundreds of devices, and show pulse characteristics at 4.2 K, demonstrating LSI circuit operation at low temperatures. The mixed-mode design showed lower power dissipation but had increasing jitter at longer dwell times. The digital design eliminated jitter but at the expense of increased power dissipation. Although power dissipation is higher in the digital design, it should be possible to thermally anchor such control circuits at the 1 K stage of a dilution refrigerator thereby minimizing heat propagation to the qubits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4616981/4616982/04617125.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"475","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2008.143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2008.143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Qubit Control-Pulse Generator Circuits for Operation at Cryogenic Temperatures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Quantum computing","Generators","Electrostatic discharge","Cryogenics","Power dissipation","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","cryogenic electronics","digital integrated circuits","large scale integration","pulse generators","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["qubit control-pulse generator circuit","cryogenics","solid-state quantum bits","dilution refrigerator","SOS-CMOS technology","LSI circuit","digital design","power dissipation","heat propagation","temperature 30 mK to 300 K"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Qubit Control-Pulse Generator Circuits for Operation at Cryogenic Temperatures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203814","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Qubit Control-Pulse Generator Circuits for Operation at Cryogenic Temperatures","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"S07P11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045128S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4616981","isNumber":"4616982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4616981","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4616982","articleId":"4617125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4617162,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The superparamagnetic limit imposes a signal-to-noise ratio, thermal stability, and writability tradeoff that limits the ability to continue to scale traditional magnetic recording technology to higher storage densities. Heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) offers a new degree of freedom with elevated writing temperature that holds the promise of extending the areal density of magnetic data storage. By temporarily heating the media during the recording process, the media coercivity can be lowered below the available applied magnetic write field, allowing higher media anisotropy and therefore smaller thermally stable grains. The heated region is then rapidly cooled in the presence of the applied head field where transition is recorded. With a tightly focused laser beam heating the media, the write process is similar to magneto- optical recording, but in a HAMR system the readout is performed with a magneto-resistive element.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4616981/4616982/04617162.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2008.180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2008.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording on High Anisotropy Nanocomposite Media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Heating","Magnetic recording","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Magnetic heads","Head","Magnetic anisotropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","hard discs","laser beam applications","magnetic anisotropy","magnetoresistive devices","nanocomposites","thermal stability","thermomagnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heat assisted magnetic recording","high anisotropy nanocomposite media","magnetic areal density","hard disk drive recording","superparamagnetic limit","signal-to-noise ratio","thermal stability","writability tradeoff","storage density","media coercivity","applied magnetic write field","magnetic anisotropy","focused laser beam heating","magneto-optical recording","magneto-resistive element"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording on High Anisotropy Nanocomposite Media","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10186966","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording on High Anisotropy Nanocomposite Media","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"S09P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113838S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4616981","isNumber":"4616982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4616981","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4616982","articleId":"4617162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4617165,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas M.

The key ingredient is the use of fault injection components (i.e. mutants and saboteurs), which are tailored according to the noise model. The evaluation of quantum fault tolerant (FT) schemes is dominated by analytical studies, mostly restricted to independent probabilistic faults. The model adopted herein addresses general noise, which includes: probabilistic faults, amplitude errors, depolarization, amplitude damping, and phase damping. This way, we show that a rigorous CAD analysis for lower levels of FT schemes can be performed. The results can then be used to tune up simulation or analytical parameters for the higher levels.

At present, there are a number of research efforts that have focused on different devices that might either replace or augment CMOS technology such that the performance scaling trends that we have seen for the last 30 years - and expect for the next 10-15 years - might continue beyond the year 2020. This work represents one such effort and focuses on computing with nanoscale magnets. Our goals are two-fold: First, we extend our previous work to develop more accurate and detailed designs of the structures required to perform a computationally interesting task with nanomagnets. Second, we analyze the performance of said systems and compare the results to what one might expect from end-of-the-roadmap CMOS, as well as other emerging device technologies and their requisite architectures - namely, nano wire-based PLA's. Magnetic logic based on ferrite cores was pursued in the 1950's, but due to disadvantages such as size, was replaced by semiconductor technology. We are studying systems made from nanomagnets that (i) are scalable, (ii) do not possess the disadvantages of the early, bulky, ferrite core magnets, and (iii) can be arranged to form circuits within the quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) architecture scheme (A. Imre, January 2006). For nanomagnet-based QCA (MQCA), wires, gates, and inverters have all been experimentally realized and verified, they operate at room temperature, and we estimate that if 1010 magnets switch 108 times/second, they would dissipate only about 0.1 W (G. Gsaba, et al., 2005). That said, more than just magnets are required for computation. A lithographically-defined clock structure is used to generate a magnetic field that polarizes groups of nanomagnets along their hard axes and removes the remanent magnetizations associated with a previous computation. When the field is removed, magnets relax to their new preferred state in response to new inputs. While the power loss from nanomagnet switching events should be quite low, the power loss from the clock is anticipated to be more significant, and constitutes the bulk of the energy required to perform a computation with MQCA. We extend our previous work to consider a more thorough and detailed analysis of an MQCA system (i.e. components such as the clock generation circuitry will also be considered.) On the surface, this technology has many attractive features that could bolster the performance of systems-level applications. Devices should be low power, non-volatile,radiation hard, and should have a natural interface with MRAM. However, again, the aggregate system must better the projected state-of-the-art for at least some tasks of interest. To provide some initial insight into MQCA's potential in this regard, we will compare MQCA circuit designs to functionally equivalent designs in CMOS and other emerging technologies. Our metric of choice will be energy-delay product (EDP) as this provides some insight into both performance (i.e. latency) as well as energy.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2008.192","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4616981/4616982/04617174.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2008.192","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","startPage":"637","endPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Logic Based on Coupled Nanomagnets: Clocking Structures and Power Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Logic Based on Coupled Nanomagnets: Clocking Structures and Power Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617174/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617174/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203859","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Logic Based on Coupled Nanomagnets: Clocking Structures and Power Analysis","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"S09P16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046072S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4616981","isNumber":"4616982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4616981","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4616982","articleId":"4617174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4617198,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Edward Lyshevski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York 14623, USA"],"firstName":"Sergey Edward","lastName":"Lyshevski","id":"37326934800"},{"name":"Vlad Shmerko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Shmerko","id":"37282986400"},{"name":"Marina Alexandra Lyshevski","affiliation":["Microsystems and Nanotechnologies, Webster, New York 14580-4400, USA"],"firstName":"Marina Alexandra","lastName":"Lyshevski","id":"37326871200"},{"name":"Svetlana Yanushchkevich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Svetlana","lastName":"Yanushchkevich","id":"37087747796"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2104-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2103-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"4617198","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Neurons","Hypercubes","Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling","Topology","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical computing","neural nets","neurophysiology","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional reconfigurable vector neural networks","neurocomputing paradigm","neuroscience","engineered molecular processing platforms","Foster preeminent technology-centric design algorithms","computing hardware synthesis","neuronal processing","stochastic computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617198","abstract":"-This paper proposes and studies the premise of three-dimensional (3D) reconfigurable vector neural networks (\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3DV</sup>\nNNs).

In this paper, we present a fiber-coupled Fourier-transform microspectrometer of a nominal size of 3 cm times 3 cm times 3 cm, constructed using 3D hybrid microassembly.

We use modular microscale parts, including minimum energy compliant MEMS fasteners, in order to configure a die-sized microoptical bench.

To reduce cost, resources, such as memories and interconnect, are shared between applications. However, resource sharing introduces interference between the sharing applications, making it difficult to satisfy their real-time requirements. Existing arbiters do not efficiently satisfy the requirements of applications in SoCs, as they either couple rate or allocation granularity to latency, or cannot run at high speeds in hardware with a low-cost implementation. The contribution of this paper is an arbiter called credit- controlled static-priority (CCSP), consisting of a rate regulator and a static-priority scheduler. The rate regulator isolates applications by regulating the amount of provided service in a way that decouples allocation granularity and latency. The static-priority scheduler decouples latency and rate, such that low latency can be provided to any application, regardless of the allocated rate. We show that CCSP belongs to the class of latency-rate servers and guarantees the allocated rate within a maximum latency, as required by hard real-time applications. We present a hardware implementation of the arbiter in the context of a DDR2 SDRAM controller.

Because of its superior read performance, OneNAND flash became the most promising storage solution for implementing high performance mobile device which adopts demand paging memory architecture. However, unfortunately, existing general purpose operating systems, such as Linux, fail to exploit the read performance of OneNAND flash because of a restriction imposed by their I/O architecture and device driver interface. This paper investigated the cause of such inability, and proposed the design of vectored read scheme for solving that problem. Implementation studies on Linux kernel shows that vectored read scheme reduces the block level read latency of OneNAND flash by up to 41% compared with commercial FTL device.

Complexity increases when there are more than one inputs and outputs making the system unrealizable. The ordinal structure model of fuzzy reasoning has an advantage of an easier approach of setting the rules with multiple inputs and outputs. This is achieved by giving an associated weightto each rule in the defuzzification process. An ordinal fuzzy logic controller has been designed with application for obstacle avoidance of Khepera mobile robot. Implementation show that ordinal structure fuzzy is easier to design compared to conventional fuzzy controller. However finding the best weight for each rule is a large and complex search problem. A specially tailored Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach has been proposed to find the best weight value foreach rule in the ordinal structure fuzzy controller. In this work, the comparison of direct and incremental GA for optimization of the controller is presented. Simulation results demonstrated significantly improved obstacle avoidance performance of incremental GA optimization of ordinal fuzzy controllers compared to direct GA optimized controller.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2008.70","pdfPath":"/iel5/4617324/4617326/04617360.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"134","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","publicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2008.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4617326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Direct and Incremental Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of Ordinal Fuzzy Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Direct and Incremental Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of Ordinal Fuzzy Controllers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10203965","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4617360/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Direct and Incremental Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of Ordinal Fuzzy Controllers","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3263a128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048818S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4617324","isNumber":"4617326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4617324","xplore-issue":"4617326","articleId":"4617360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4617367,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This technique is used in a system based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM has many orthogonally modulated sub-carriers which unexpectedly produce high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The high PAPR will occasionally reach the amplifier saturation region and therefore result in signal distortion, which causes bit error rate (BER) degradation. The proposed method, a sequence of input data is rearranged by SLM for the reduction of PAPR and then fed into the APPR process in the proposed system. The APPR method controls the peak levels of the modulation signal by an adaptive algorithm. It reduces modulation signals over a predefined range. The parameter for simulation used standard WLAN in IEEE 802.11a system. In simulation results, the proposed method shows the improvement on PAPR, power spectrum density (PSD) and high performance BER compared with conventional APPR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4617324/4617326/04617367.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2008.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2008.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4617326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique for OFDM-WLAN in 802.11a Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bit error rate","Modulation","Simulation","Silicon","Partial transmit sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak to average power ratio reduction technique","selective mapping","adaptive peak power reduction methods","OFDM-WLAN","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate","BER","IEEE 802.11a system","power spectrum density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","SLM","APPR","Wlan"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique for OFDM-WLAN in 802.11a Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10203970","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique for OFDM-WLAN in 802.11a Systems","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3263a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031026S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isNumber":"4617326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4617324","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4617367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4617374,"authors":[{"name":"Kamrul Hasan Talukder","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kamrul Hasan","lastName":"Talukder","id":"37282796500"},{"name":"Koichi Harada","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37614211800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3263-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4617374","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Image resolution","Filter bank","Transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","formal specification","formal verification","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message sequence charts","communicating thread specification","concurrent discrete wavelet transform","image compression","system design","system requirements","executable specifications","high-level transition systems","system components","nonatomic component interactions","formal verification","concurrent wavelet transform","symbolic model verifier","syntax grammar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Message Sequence Chart","Wavelet Transform","Concurrency","Image Compression","Verification Analysis"]}],"abstract":"Message sequence charts (MSCs) are an appealing visual formalism mainly used in the early stages of system design to capture the system requirements.

This specification is amenable to formal verification. We present the way how to specify the communicating threads using MSCs and how to verify the correctness of the concurrent wavelet transform used for image compression.

Like other pattern recognitions, most automatic speech recognition systems rely on HMM acoustic models. In such systems, recognition performances are significantly affected by their topologies. In this paper, we propose an HMM topology estimation approach for Thai phoneme recognition tasks whose process is divided into 2 stages. First, a set of suitable topologies are constructed by combinations of different objective functions and topology generation methods. Second, a genetic algorithm is deployed as the topology selection algorithm which considers global fitness and selects the most suitable topology from the candidates proposed in the previous stage for each phoneme. As a result, the well-trained topology yields a maximum of 4.36% error reduction over predefined left-to-right models. The estimated topologies still work well when the topology estimation was performed on speech utterances whose recording environments differ from the ones recognized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-aided Hidden Markov Model Topology Estimation for Phoneme Recognition of Thai Continuous Speech","publicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2008.73","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4617324/4617326/04617416.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2008.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4617326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4617416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4617416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-aided Hidden Markov Model Topology Estimation for Phoneme Recognition of Thai Continuous Speech","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4617416/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10204003","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm-aided Hidden Markov Model Topology Estimation for Phoneme Recognition of Thai Continuous Speech","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3263a475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057054S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4617324","isNumber":"4617326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4617324","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4617326","articleId":"4617416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4617447,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A preemptive schedule can better utilize the resources and offers a lot of flexibility. In order to schedule tasks, FPS simulates preemptive task execution at a very low overhead and requires very little runtime support. The experimental results show that, the scheduling cost of FPS is lower than that of other well known non-preemptive and preemptive list heuristic scheduling algorithms for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.

First, the structure of OFDM receiver system based on IEEE 802.11 a is established. Then, least square (LS) based channel estimation algorithm is mainly studied. Combing with the character of the preamble frame in IEEE 802.11a protocol, by using of the two long training symbol sequences in the frame preamble and de-noising technology with filters, a novel simple method to estimate channel is proposed. Simulations are done to the algorithm on some aspects such as the mean square error (MSE), constellation map of the demodulated data, bit error rate (BER) and the performance after de-noising with filters. Results show that this method could enhance the performance of the receiver in a certain level. At last, performances of the whole transceiver system based on IEEE 802.11a standard are simulated. It can be concluded that the performance of the OFDM receiver system is able to meet the requirement of IEEE 802.11a standard. Furthermore, the results prove the validity of our research on OFDM receiverpsilas channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618061","publicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603797/4618046/04618061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618046","startPage":"35","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on channel estimation for OFDM receiver based on IEEE 802.11a","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on channel estimation for OFDM receiver based on IEEE 802.11a","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203041","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on channel estimation for OFDM receiver based on IEEE 802.11a","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SS-TCL_4_KF-010715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049301S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4618071,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyang Song","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weiyang Song","id":"37690961000"},{"name":"Weihai Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weihai Chen","id":"37279188000"},{"name":"Jingmeng Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jingmeng Liu","id":"37405251500"},{"name":"Lihong Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lihong Xu","id":"37695405800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618071","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","mobile robots","optical radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive speed-adjustable scheme","3D laser scanning","FPGA","DSP","3D perception"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hardware solution for the implement of an adaptive speed-adjustable scheme for 3D laser scanning.

Since the cGAs use the PV of the current population to reproduce offsprings of the next generation instead of the genetic operators such as crossover and mutation, the cGA needs no parameter tuning. Besides, the cGA has some advantages that the cGA can be easily implemented with reducing memory requirements. However, although the update of the PV is a core in the cGA, the PV is heuristically updated by a static population size in the most previous works. In this paper, we try to improve the updating scheme not using the population size, but using the Bayesian information given by the previous generations. For this purpose, we utilize the parameter learning scheme of an ABN. Moreover, the usefulness of the proposed probabilistic approach is empirically investigated by comparing with the original cGA and other cGAs.","publicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603797/4618046/04618124.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618124","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian network-based non-parametric compact genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian network-based non-parametric compact genetic algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618124/","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618124/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186669","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian network-based non-parametric compact genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SS-ISS_3_KF-010359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081753S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4618132,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Hyun Lee","affiliation":["Robotics Program, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Hyun Lee","id":"37087201253"},{"name":"Ju-Jang Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ju-Jang Lee","id":"37087159392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618132","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","matrix algebra","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network evolution","augmenting weight matrix method","nonmating method","mutation operator","add connection","add node","delete connection","delete node","simplified alopex method","correlation based method","optimization problem","structural information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618132","abstract":"In this paper, a simple method is proposed to evolve artificial neural networks(ANNs) using augmenting weight matrix method(AWMM).

This type of networks supports a massively parallel extraction of low-level features in the processed images. Especially this characteristic is assumed to impact the performance of convolutional networks in character recognition tasks - and in particular when considering scaled, rotated, translated or otherwise deformed patterns. Yet training of convolutional networks is rather time-consuming due to the relatively high complexity of the entire model. To speed-up the training process, we will propose a new variant of convolutional networks - the so-called hybrid convolutional neural network (HCNN). HCNN-networks combine the original idea of LeCun's convolutional networks with the benefits of RBF-like neurons in all the layers and with the winner-takes- all mechanism applied during recall. In the tests done so far in hand-written digit recognition, HCNN proved to be capable of considerably speeding-up the training process while maintaining roughly the same performance of the trained networks like original convolutional networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10186681","htmlLink":"/document/4618146/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SS-PCCT1_4_KF-010316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055607S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4618149,"authors":[{"name":"Jianan Xu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China","College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jianan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37695081900"},{"name":"Mingjun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Mingjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280645000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618149","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Neural networks","Dynamics","Vehicle dynamics","Control systems","Predictive models","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion control","neurocontrollers","predictive control","remotely operated vehicles","underwater vehicles","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network modeling","generalized predictive motion control","autonomous underwater vehicle","Elman neural network online learning","multistep predictive model","fused identification model","control system adaptability","yaw velocity control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618149","abstract":"This paper investigates the application of neural network based generalized predictive motion control to an autonomous underwater vehicle.

More accurately, depending on the kind of attack it targets, NIDS can be oriented to detect misuses (by defining all possible attacks) or anomalies (by modelling legitimate behaviour to find those that do not fit into that model). Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention. In this way, ESIDE-Depian uses a Bayesian network to learn from both anomaly and misuse knowledge in order to be able to detect either kind of attacks, known and unknown. Finally, we evaluate ESIDE-Depian against all kind of menaces to prove in which degree it has been achieved to integrate both approaches.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618168","publicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603797/4618046/04618168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618046","startPage":"586","endPage":"591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating network misuse and anomaly prevention","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrating network misuse and anomaly prevention","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618168/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203097","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618168/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating network misuse and anomaly prevention","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TT-ISST3_3_KF-008613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084557S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4618173,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-ning Gan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Jun-ning","lastName":"Gan","id":"37652562100"},{"name":"Wan-rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Wan-rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536611500"},{"name":"Hong-yun Me","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Hong-yun","lastName":"Me","id":"37088154915"},{"name":"Dong-yue Jin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Dong-yue","lastName":"Jin","id":"37530292700"},{"name":"Pei Shen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37531844500"},{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37656144000"},{"name":"Li jian He","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, 100022, China"],"firstName":"Li jian","lastName":"He","id":"37687277500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618173","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Gain control","Noise figure","Silicon germanium","Multiaccess communication","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar MIMIC","code division multiple access","Ge-Si alloys","heterojunction bipolar transistors","millimetre wave transistors","radiofrequency amplifiers","UHF transistors","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high dynamic range variable gain amplifier","WCDMA applications","gain control stage","voltage control","noise figure","unction technology","heterojunction technology","wideband code-division multiple access communication system","wireless communication system","voltage 0 V to 2.7 V","gain 11 dB to 60 dB","frequency 1.95 GHz","size 0.35 mum","frequency 43 GHz","noise figure 4.685 dB","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear-in-dB gain control","high dynamic range","variable gain amplifier","SiGe HBT"]}],"abstract":"A high dynamic range linear-in-dB variable gain amplifier (VGA) using SiGe HBT devices for WCDMA applications is presented in this paper.

An intelligent vehicle and a service robot require these techniques. In particular, there is a big demand for line detection because it has a wide range of applications. The line features in an image are used for object identification, robot navigation, and intelligent vehicle control. To detect the lines, a Hough transform is generally used. The Hough transform has good detection results and it is robust to noise, but it takes a long time to execute and it requires a great deal of memory to store the parameter space. This paper proposes a dedicated line detection hardware system. To increase the processing speed, it has a parallel Hough transform unit, and it partitions the parameter space to decrease the memory requirements. It can detect not only the line parameters, but also the exact start and end points of each line, and it sorts these lines by length. It can display the detected line on a monitor via the DVI interface. This system is designed with VHDL and implemented on an XC4VLX200 FPGA. The device usage is about 15% and the maximum clock frequency is 67 MHz. It can detect up to 256 lines in one image frame and it can process up to 149 frames per second. The simulation and real experimental results are given to verify the system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time finite line detection system based on FPGA","publicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618183","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603797/4618046/04618183.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A real-time finite line detection system based on FPGA","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618183/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time finite line detection system based on FPGA","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TT-SCT3_3_KF-003883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052633S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4618192,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Weihua","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Weihua","id":"37402579500"},{"name":"Huang Fenggang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Huang Fenggang","id":"37398296800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618192","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","correlation methods","independent component analysis","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain blind source separation","permutation indetermination","amplitude correlation matrixes","independent component analysis"]}],"abstract":"The permutation indetermination is a very important problem in the frequency domain blind source separation.

HWNN makes good use of the characteristics of wavelet neural networks (WNN) and back-propagation neural networks (BPN), so that it inherits WNNpsilas capability in learning efficiency and BPNpsilas performance consistency in classification problems. We conducted k-fold cross validation (CV) to compare the performance of this single neural net classifier with some of the other existing multiple classifier systems (MCS) including logiboost Bayesian classifier (LBC), multistage neural networks ensemble (MNNE), and self-organizing neural Grove (SONG). The results show that HWNN achieves higher classification accuracy than the three methods being compared. Besides, HWNN is faster than SONG in terms of computation time. Furthermore, we augment HWNN by introducing an extra moment term in the learning process to further speed up the convergence of the learning. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that this improved HWNN (iHWNN) actually outperforms HWNN in terms of classification accuracy and computation time.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618266","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1102","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603797/4618046/04618266.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2008.4618266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network and its performance evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Bayes methods","neural nets","pattern classification","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","hybrid wavelet neural networks","backpropagation neural networks","k-fold cross validation","multiple classifier systems","logiboost Bayesian classifier","multistage neural networks ensemble","self-organizing neural grove"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network and its performance evaluation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618266/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10203169","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network and its performance evaluation","confLoc":"Daejeon","sourcePdf":"TT-CCI4_4_KF-009881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059901S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603797","isNumber":"4618046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618046","articleId":"4618266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4618271,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Strasser","affiliation":["Robotics and Adaptive Systems, PROFACTOR GmbH, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Strasser","id":"37298728200"},{"name":"Christoph Sunder","affiliation":["Automation and Control Institute (ACIN), Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Sunder","id":"37268160800"},{"name":"Antonio Valentini","affiliation":["03NEIDA Europe ASBL, Rue de L'Eglise 42, Belgium"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Valentini","id":"37672002600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2170-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2171-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4618271","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Automation","Computer architecture","Software","Object oriented modeling","Embedded systems","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","industrial control","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven embedded systems design","industrial automation","industrial control systems","FP7 research project","MEDEIA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618271","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to describe a model-driven embedded systems design approach which is applied to Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS).

The complexity of the multichannel equalization method restricts its use widely. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) converts the frequency selective channel into parallel non-frequency selective subchannel and eliminates the intersymbol interference. This paper investigates using Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of known space time coding schemes in an OFDM environment with different channel delay spreads. Simulation results (i.e. frame error rate) show that super-orthogonal space time code in an OFDM environment outperform other schemes (i.e. STTC-OFM and STBC-OFDM) with delay spreads incorporated.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2008.4618434","publicationTitle":"MELECON 2008 - The 14th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MELECON 2008 - The 14th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604648/4618400/04618434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MELCON.2008.4618434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618400","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of space time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing schemes with delay spreads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of space time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing schemes with delay spreads","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618434/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10203447","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of space time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing schemes with delay spreads","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"t2-sf0016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047523S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604648","isNumber":"4618400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604648","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4618400","articleId":"4618434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4618442,"authors":[{"name":"Toni Janevski","affiliation":["Skopje, Macedonia"],"bio":{"p":["Toni Janevski is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje, Macedonia.

Development of distributed generation units, along with concerns raised over the security of supply has prompted many customers to consider the installation of their own local capacity for generating electricity (and heat). This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing the operation of a portfolio of distributed units, based on profit maximization using genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are an optimization method based on the analogy with biological evolution, where the so-called population of solutions evolves through generations as a result of recombination, mutation and selection processes. Optimization is carried out based on the day-ahead forecast of hourly market prices of electricity. The method is tested on a set of distributed units, demonstrating the ability to find good solutions in an acceptable time period.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618530/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10203529","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618530/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the operation of distributed generation in market environment using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the operation of distributed generation in market environment using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"t5-sf0116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064555S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604648","isNumber":"4618400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604648","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4618400","articleId":"4618530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4618541,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, NoCs need to deliver this high bandwidth at low latencies, while keeping within a tight power envelope. In this paper, we present a novel NoC with hybrid interconnect that leverages multiple types of interconnects - specifically, conventional full-swing short-range wires for the data path, in conjunction with low-swing, multi-drop wires with long-range, ultra-low-latency communication for the flow control signals. We show how this proposed system can be used to overcome key limitations of express virtual channels (EVC), a recently proposed flow control technique that allows packets to bypass intermediate routers to simultaneously improve energy-delay-throughput. Our preliminary results show up to a 8.2% reduction in power and up to a 44% improvement in latency under heavy load compared to the original EVC design that only uses the conventional full-swing

These structures can be inserted at driver or/and receiver side at either the chip or package level and the communication bandwidth can be improved with little overhead on power consumption. Using the area of the eye as the objective function to be maximized, we optimized these equalizers for the CPU-memory interconnection of an IBM POWER6trade System with and without practical constraints on the RLCG parameter values. Our experimental results show that without employing any equalizers, the data-eye is closed for a bit-rate of 6.4 Gbps. We tried twelve different equalizer schemes and found they produce very different eye diagrams. The scheme yielding the maximum eye improves the height of the eye to more than 300 mV at a total power cost of 7.2 mW, while the scheme yielding the minimum jitter limits the jitter magnitude to 10 ps at a total power cost of 9.5 mW. We also have shown that the solution resulting from the proposed optimization approach have very small sensitivity to the tolerance of the R,L,C values and the magnitude of the coupled noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618576/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10187065","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618576/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low Power Passive Equalizer Design for Computer Memory Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Passive Equalizer Design for Computer Memory Links","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3380a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096628S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4618557","isNumber":"4618558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4618557","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4618558","articleId":"4618576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4618577,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Hadke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Hadke","id":"37660455100"},{"name":"Tony Benavides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Benavides","id":"37297018100"},{"name":"S.J.

We show that OCDIMM has at least three key benefits when compared to alternatives such as FBDIMM (fully buffered DIMM), which is used in products from Sun (U. Nawathe et al., 2008) and Intel. First, replacing the multi-hop store-and-forward network in the FBDIMM architecture by a WDM (wavelength-division multiplexing) based optical interconnect results in significantly lower latency (up to 50% reduction in some configurations). Second, it is scalable to much higher capacities (such as 32 DIMMs per channel) with only a modest degradation in latency. Third, due to the higher data rate of an optical interface and the concurrency offered by multiple wavelengths, OCDIMM offers up to a 90% improvement in memory bandwidth. Most importantly, these benefits can be obtained using off-the-shelf DRAM devices, by making simple modifications to the DIMM circuit board and the memory controller.","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2008.25","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/4618557/4618558/04618577.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2008.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OCDIMM: Scaling the DRAM Memory Wall Using WDM Based Optical Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"OCDIMM: Scaling the DRAM Memory Wall Using WDM Based Optical Interconnects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618577/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10204054","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618577/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OCDIMM: Scaling the DRAM Memory Wall Using WDM Based Optical Interconnects","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3380a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051658S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4618557","isNumber":"4618558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4618557","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4618558","articleId":"4618577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4618583,"authors":[{"name":"Miad Faezipour","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Miad","lastName":"Faezipour","id":"37296205600"},{"name":"Mehrdad Nourani","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"37273839500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4794"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5569"}],"articleNumber":"4618583","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Radiation detectors","Pattern matching","Doped fiber amplifiers","Logic gates","Inverters","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","finite automata","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint repetition inspection","FPGA","network intrusion detection system","nondeterministic finite automata","field programmable gate arrays","regular expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Intrusion Detection System","Non-deterministic Finite Automata","Regular Expression","Constraint Repetition Inspection"]}],"abstract":"Recent network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) use regular expressions to represent suspicious or malicious character sequences in packet payloads in a more efficient way.

This block is a customized counter capable of handling any type of constraint repetition, applicable to any sub-regular expression.

However, there are quite significant challenges at this frequency range such as high propagation loss, oxygen absorption, antenna alignment and unavailability of high-gain, high power circuit elements. In this paper we present a novel 2-channel hybrid smart-antenna system operating at 60 GHz band which can be used with an antenna switching system to improve the signal power performance and to serve as an automated alignment system. The critical system parameters for a smart-antenna system at this frequency are the transmitter to receiver distance, element spacing, and antenna beamwidth. As the widely known beamforming assumptions may not hold for some configurations, a more general beamforming formulation is given in the paper to serve as a guideline for system designers. The twist angle of array elements is introduced as a new array design parameter. By selecting the optimal twist angle to help overlap radiation patterns, the fine alignment of the transmit and receive beams is established electronically using beamforming, thus reducing the cost of deployment and maintenance of the 60 GHz indoor communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618677/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185769","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and Experimental Verification of a Smart Antenna System Operating at 60 GHz Band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and Experimental Verification of a Smart Antenna System Operating at 60 GHz Band","sourcePdf":"56tap09-celik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066692S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4618673","articleId":"4618677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4618678,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4618673/4618678/4618678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Jian Cheng (S'08) was born in Sichuan Province, China, on April 20, 1983.

Both the sum and difference beams can be generated only employing a single DVLTSA respectively through the multimode substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) feeding technology. With detailed theoretical analysis, a prototype of the monopulse antenna proposed at the center frequency of 36 GHz was integrated on a single substrate using the normal PCB process. Measured gain of the sum beam is 10.6 dBi, while the zero depth of the difference beam is lower than -35 dB.

This paper introduces a new non-iterative method for linear array synthesis based on the matrix pencil method (MPM). The method can synthesize a nonuniform linear array with a reduced number of elements, and can be also used to reduce the number of elements for linear arrays designed by other synthesis techniques. In the proposed method, the desired radiation pattern is first sampled to form a discrete pattern data set. Then we organize the discrete data set in a form of Hankel matrix and perform the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix. By discarding the non-principal singular values, we obtain an optimal lower-rank approximation of the Hankel matrix. The lower-rank matrix actually corresponds to fewer antenna elements. The matrix pencil method is then utilized to reconstruct the excitation and location distributions from the approximated matrix. Numerical examples show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed synthesis method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4618673/04618700.pdf","startPage":"2955","endPage":"2962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.928801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.928801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Number of Elements in a Linear Antenna Array by the Matrix Pencil Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear antenna arrays","Matrix decomposition","Antenna arrays","Sparse matrices","Singular value decomposition","Satellite antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Satellite communication","Costs","Scholarships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","approximation theory","Hankel matrices","linear antenna arrays","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear antenna array","matrix pencil method","antenna radiation pattern","Hankel matrix","singular value decomposition","approximation theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array synthesis","low rank approximation","matrix pencil method (MPM)","nonuniform antenna arrays","singular value decomposition (SVD)","sparse antenna array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Number of Elements in a Linear Antenna Array by the Matrix Pencil Method","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4618700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185788","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Number of Elements in a Linear Antenna Array by the Matrix Pencil Method","sourcePdf":"56tap09-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057626S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4618673","articleId":"4618700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4618702,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Martinez-Fernandez","affiliation":["Departamento de Electromagnetismo y Teor\u00eda de Circuitos, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4618673/4618702/4618702-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez was born in Madrid, Spain.

An optimized profile UWB planar monopole designed by means of a Simulated Annealing algorithm and full three-dimensional finite element method, detailed in a companion paper, was considered as the design starting point. In order to design the band-notched rejection no full finite element analysis is carried out on each profile modification as is usual. The procedure is based on a genetic algorithm and a multipurpose admittance matrix approach instead. Artificial ports are allowed in the computational domain and an admittance-type matrix comes up. As a result, a multiport network describes the electromagnetics within the analysis domain. Circuit manipulations of this network efficiently outperform full-wave analyses for different monopole modifications, thus making it possible to use this strategy in a computer aided-design scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Notched UWB Planar Monopole Antenna Optimization Using a Finite Element Method-Based Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.928805","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4618673/04618702.pdf","startPage":"2884","endPage":"2893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.928805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Notched UWB Planar Monopole Antenna Optimization Using a Finite Element Method-Based Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4618702/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Notched UWB Planar Monopole Antenna Optimization Using a Finite Element Method-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"56tap09-martinezfernandez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079217S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4618673","articleId":"4618702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4618703,"authors":[{"name":"Jose A.

The basic antenna configuration consists of two oppositely facing paraboloidal reflectors sharing a common focal point. A planar feed array is used to illuminate the subreflector allowing the antenna to scan its beam. The resulting quadratic aberrations can be compensated by active mechanical deformation of the subreflector surface, which is based on translation, rotation and focal length adjustment. In order to reduce the complexity of the mechanical deformation, least squares fit paraboloids are defined to approximate the optimal correction surface. These best fit paraboloids considerably reduce scanning losses and pattern degradation. This work also introduces two different zooming techniques for the Gregorian confocal dual reflector antenna: the first consists of introducing a controlled quadratic path error to the main reflector aperture; and the second is based on reducing the size of the radiating aperture of the feeding array.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.928777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4618673/04618703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.928777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618673","startPage":"2910","endPage":"2919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zooming and Scanning Gregorian Confocal Dual Reflector Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zooming and Scanning Gregorian Confocal Dual Reflector Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185791","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4618703/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zooming and Scanning Gregorian Confocal Dual Reflector Antennas","sourcePdf":"56tap09-martinezlorenzo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166577S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4618673","articleId":"4618703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4618704,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A conventional annular-ring slot antenna is first analyzed, and it is found that two adjacent CP modes can be simultaneously excited through the proximity coupling of an L-shaped feed line. By tuning the dimensions of this L-shaped feed line, the two CP modes can be coupled together and a broad CP bandwidth is thus formed. The design method is also valid when the inner circular patch of the annular-ring slot antenna is vertically raised from the ground plane. In this case, the original band-limited ring slot antenna is converted into a wide-band structure that is composed of a circular wide slot and a parasitic patch, and consequently the CP bandwidth is further enhanced. For the patch-loaded wide slot antenna, its key parameters are investigated to show how to couple the two CP modes and achieve impedance matching. The effects of the distance between the parasitic patch and wide slot on the CP bandwidth and antenna gain are also presented and discussed in details.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.928769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4618673/04618711.pdf","startPage":"2826","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.928769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly-Polarized Wide Slot Antenna Loaded With a Parasitic Patch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618711/","displayDocTitle":"Circularly-Polarized Wide Slot Antenna Loaded With a Parasitic Patch","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185797","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circularly-Polarized Wide Slot Antenna Loaded With a Parasitic Patch","sourcePdf":"56tap09-row.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042428S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"74","articleId":"4618711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4618715,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In the field of wave propagation in plasmas, the mainstream in theory and applications is oriented to frequency domain asymptotic methods, where the determination of the plasma response presents less difficulty. However, in many cases of interest (like, e.g., mode conversion) this approach breaks down, the solution becomes questionable and therefore a full-wave analysis is necessary. In this work, we present a (novel) scattered-field FDTD algorithm for fully kinetic, anisotropic plasma. As an application, we study the perpendicular electron-cyclotron propagation and absorption in simplified tokamak geometry, under different physics models for the dielectric response of the plasma. In general, since FDTD is a time domain technique, conversion from the frequency domain is needed in order to be able to exploit the existing knowhow on the dielectric response. However, in the case of a constant-frequency wave propagating in a stationary plasma, the FDTD method can be applied directly using the frequency domain dielectric tensor.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.928774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4618673/04618717.pdf","startPage":"2988","endPage":"2994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.928774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattered-Field FDTD Algorithm for Hot Anisotropic Plasma With Application to EC Heating","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618717/","displayDocTitle":"Scattered-Field FDTD Algorithm for Hot Anisotropic Plasma With Application to EC Heating","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185803","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618717/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattered-Field FDTD Algorithm for Hot Anisotropic Plasma With Application to EC Heating","sourcePdf":"56tap09-tsironis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081368S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4618673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4618673","articleId":"4618717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4618723,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538295800"},{"name":"Wei Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hong","id":"38667477800"},{"name":"Chen Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404659900"},{"name":"Zhen-Qi Kuai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-Qi","lastName":"Kuai","id":"37318202800"},{"name":"Yu-Dan Don","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Dan","lastName":"Don","id":"37687862500"},{"name":"Jian-Yi Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Yi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291307800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4618723","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":221,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Slot antennas","Ultra wideband antennas","Antenna feeds","Etching","Optical ring resonators","Frequency","Antenna measurements","FCC","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","microstrip antennas","microstrip resonators","monopole antennas","multifrequency antennas","planar antennas","slot antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar ultrawideband antennas","patch monopole UWB antenna","etched slot antenna","split ring resonators","SRR","feed line","electromagnetic coupling","multiple narrow frequency notched band","multiband antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Notched band","split ring resonator (SRR)","split ring slot","ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"]}],"abstract":"Three types of ultrawideband (UWB) antennas with triple notched bands are proposed and investigated for UWB communication applications.

We then describe why this traditional approach loses validity at the nanoscale. Next, we describe semiclassical ballistic transport and the Landauer-Buttiker approach to phase-coherent quantum transport. Realistic devices include interactions that break quantum mechanical phase and also cause energy relaxation. As a result, transport in nanodevices is between diffusive and phase coherent. We introduce the NEGF approach, which can be used to model devices all the way from ballistic to diffusive limits. This is followed by a summary of equations that are used to model a large class of structures such as nanotransistors, carbon nanotubes, and nanowires.

In general, temporal correlated signals are not independent which means the independence assumption for independent component analysis method is not satisfied. To achieve good separation performance, we apply high order statistics and temporal structure together to put the separation processing in residual level. The residual signals, which is residual part of source signals by extracted temporal structure, are independent. We discuss two types of BSS problem: instantaneous BSS and convolutive BSS. The cost function is derived by simplifying the mutual information of residual signals for both cases. And then we develop efficient learning algorithms respectively.

The TD-SEFIE and TD-VEFIE, which enforce fundamental boundary and field consistency conditions on conducting surfaces and dielectric volumes, are solved by marching-on-in-time (MOT) [1]. Hierarchical regularization [2-3] is applied to the TD-SEFIE to render it immune to low-frequency breakdown; no regularization is applied to the TD-VEFIE as it is protected from low-frequency breakdown by an identity term [1]. At low-frequencies (i.e., when the time-step size is large), the MOT matrices constructed using hierarchical bases are far better-conditioned than those constructed using standard RWG [4] and loop-star bases [5]; hence the iterative solution of hierarchically-regularized MOT systems is considerably faster than that of its unregularized counterpart. The proposed technique is used to analyze low-frequency electromagnetic transients on realistically modeled computer boards.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4618925","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04618925.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4618925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A well-conditioned integral-equation formulation for transient analysis of low-frequency microelectronic devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4618925/","displayDocTitle":"A well-conditioned integral-equation formulation for transient analysis of low-frequency microelectronic devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204625","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4618925/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A well-conditioned integral-equation formulation for transient analysis of low-frequency microelectronic devices","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s102p7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055605S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4618925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4618976,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Akiyama","affiliation":["Information Technology R & D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Japan"],"lastName":"Tomohiro Akiyama","id":"37289409400"},{"name":"Jiro Suzuki","affiliation":["Information Technology R & D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Japan"],"lastName":"Jiro Suzuki","id":"37693779600"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Ando","affiliation":["Information Technology R & D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiyuki Ando","id":"37569234700"},{"name":"Takeshi Sakimura","affiliation":["Information Technology R & D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Japan"],"lastName":"Takeshi Sakimura","id":"37701148700"},{"name":"Yohihito Hirano","affiliation":["Information Technology R & D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Japan"],"lastName":"Yohihito Hirano","id":"37693960800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4618976","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Fiber optics","Optical modulation","Optical polarization","Arrays","Antenna measurements","Optical beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","beam steering","spatial light modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial light modulator","optically controlled beamformer","Ku band","phase distribution","beam steering control","two-dimensional beam steering","optically controlled array antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4618976","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4618976","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","abstract":"This paper presents a spatial light modulator-based optical beamformer with 100 (10times10) elements, and its experiments in Ku band, such as the amplitude and the phase distribution, and the beam steering control.

There are different types of optical delay lines such as optical fiber delay lines, fiber Bragg grating delay lines, photonic crystal delay lines and coupled resonator optical waveguides. The crucial criterion to choose the proper delay line for beamforming is the tunability of the delay line. It is preferred to use a continuous delay line to steer the beam accurately to any direction within the coverage region and avoid complex lossy and bulky switching circuits. Among different delay lines, optical ring resonators are more promising for beamforming application shows an optical resonator delay line consisted of parallel rings coupled to a waveguide.

Moreover, the coupling factors are adjusted manually [Zhuang, et al., 2005].

However, due to the overall low correlation, the corresponding MIMO capacity gain over SISO capacity only increases from about 1.78 to about 1.87, and thus only a small extra capacity obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular MIMO system performance versus base station element spacing","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619033","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619033.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cellular MIMO system performance versus base station element spacing","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619033/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204748","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular MIMO system performance versus base station element spacing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s120p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040506S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4619037,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Cheng","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Lin Cheng","id":"37087157174"},{"name":"Benjamin E.

The radio propagation is modeled as a set of plane waves, approximated by rays which, undergoing multiple scattering phenomena (reflection, diffraction, transmission), link the transmitting to receiving antennas. Typically, the computational time of RT tools quickly increases as the complexity of the scenario and the maximum order of bouncing allowed grow. Several acceleration techniques have been proposed based on a reduction of the total number of ray-facet intersection tests [1-2-3]. In order to reduce the allowed rays, one can resort to algorithms typically employed in computer graphics: to this end, an evaluation of visibility relations between pair of facets and between facets and transmitting/receiving antennas is needed (two objects - antenna or facets - are visible if and only if a not occluded direct ray can be traced between them).","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619043","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An acceleration technique for Ray Tracing simulation based on a shadow volumetric binary and line space partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An acceleration technique for Ray Tracing simulation based on a shadow volumetric binary and line space partitioning","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204374","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An acceleration technique for Ray Tracing simulation based on a shadow volumetric binary and line space partitioning","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s121p7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073161S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4619044,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Lakafosis","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of ECE, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Lakafosis","id":"37540508600"},{"name":"Manos M.

However, multiple antennas are not easily integrated in mobile devices or sensors, because the space available is usually limited. Moreover, in order to lead high performances, good isolation and decoupling between antennas are required. Another drawback is that multiple antennas require multiple RF devices for signal processing that are very expensive. To suppress mutual coupling several methods were proposed in the available literature. In [1] the distance between MIMO antennas array was increased mounting them at the corner of a PDA. In [2] several parasitic elements were employed between MIMO antenna array, while in [3] band-notch slots on a ground plane were etched. In this paper we propose a new MIMO antenna that consists in a metallic ring fed at four ports with alternate phase. The alternate phase of the feeding leads to the excitation of orthogonal modes and allows the implementation of the MIMO antenna. The antenna has been analysed using the Theory of Characteristic Modes [4], which is really appropriate to design multimode antennas because of the physical insight it provides.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modal analysis of a MIMO antenna for sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Resonant frequency","Current distribution","Antenna theory","Loading","Microwave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna feeds","fading channels","MIMO communication","signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modal analysis","sensor networks","multiple antennas","multiple-input multiple-output systems","channel fading","signal processing","mutual coupling suppression","MIMO antennas array","orthogonal modes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modal analysis of a MIMO antenna for sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219744","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal analysis of a MIMO antenna for sensor networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s126p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058304S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619076,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud L.

For this reason, it is desirable to have simulation methods to study the propagation of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves under water. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [2-5] is one of the most widely used methods in electromagnetic simulation. Unfortunately, the discrete Fourier transform method used to quantify the results of the time-domain simulation is not practical at ELF. Furthermore, the Bessel/Legendre expansion method used to verify the FDTD results is also not valid at low frequencies. These two major issues are addressed in this paper. Results comparing the FDTD and an analytic method confirm the accuracy of FDTD at low frequencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619148.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater FDTD simulation at low frequencies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Mathematical model","Equations","Materials","Accuracy","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","ships","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antiship mines","electromagnetic signature","surface ship","low frequency electromagnetic waves under water","finite-difference time-domain method","electromagnetic simulation","underwater FDTD simulation","time-domain simulation","Bessel-Legendre expansion method","discrete Fourier transform method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Underwater FDTD simulation at low frequencies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619148/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219420","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater FDTD simulation at low frequencies","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s143p1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044298S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4619159,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

The MIMO performance of the antenna systems is assessed using tools that combine the active E-field radiation patterns of the antennas with appropriate channel models. The studies properly treat the effect of the user on the antenna system via an electromagnetics exact formulation. It is shown that MIMO antennas in wireless devices provide a degree of system robustness under a variety of simulated usage conditions.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619162","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of a user on the performance of MIMO antenna systems in small wireless devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619162/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of a user on the performance of MIMO antenna systems in small wireless devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619162/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of a user on the performance of MIMO antenna systems in small wireless devices","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s204p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028117S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619163,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Ting Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jui-Ting Chuang","id":"37686221800"},{"name":"Fu-Chiarng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Chiarng Chen","id":"37291643000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619163","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Approximation methods","Mutual coupling","MIMO","Antennas","Accuracy","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO spatial correlation approximations","angular spread","approximate correlation formulation","AoA distribution","uniform-distribution-like AoA scenarios","correlation calculation","MIMO antennas"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new approximate correlation formulation when the AoA distribution is uniform distribution or other uniform-distribution-like AoA scenarios.

These systems use multiple antennas at both receiver and transmitter in order to increase communication capacity. Theoretically, the higher the number of antennas, the better the capacity enhancement. However, their radiation characteristics have also an important impact on the channel capacity. Antenna patterns which offer low signal correlation between each radiating element are suitable for a high channel capacity. Furthermore, since the channel is not stationary, it is interesting that each antenna of the MIMO system can switch between different radiation pattern configurations in order to optimize in real time the channel capacity to prevent environment modifications. So reconfigurable antennas used as one of multiple radiating elements offer an additional degree of freedom for adaptive MIMO communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619209.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of adaptive MIMO systems using radiation pattern recongurable antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","MIMO","Antennas and propagation","Transmitting antennas","Adaptive arrays","Antennas","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO systems","radiation pattern reconfigurable antennas","multiple input multiple output applications","multipath scattering effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of adaptive MIMO systems using radiation pattern recongurable antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619209/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219753","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of adaptive MIMO systems using radiation pattern recongurable antennas","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s210p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06702S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619210,"authors":[{"name":"Prathaban Mookiah","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Prathaban","lastName":"Mookiah","id":"37394266600"},{"name":"Daniele Piazza","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Piazza","id":"37304110100"},{"name":"Kapil R.

In the proposed method, it is not required to solve 1D FDTD for calculation of an incident plane wave. In addition, no reflected wave from the 1D absorbing boundary exists. Hence, in the TF region, the resulting incident wave can be more close to the exact plane wave than that for the conventional method. Since a monochromatic wave can not be excited in any FDTD scheme, at the beginning of the wave propagation, error between the exact wave and wave simulated by FDTD method can exist. However, this error will decrease with increasing time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sinusoidal plane wave excitation method without solving 1D FDTD in 2D ID-FDTD scheme","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619352","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619352.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sinusoidal plane wave excitation method without solving 1D FDTD in 2D ID-FDTD scheme","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619352/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204581","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sinusoidal plane wave excitation method without solving 1D FDTD in 2D ID-FDTD scheme","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s232p10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089657S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619354,"authors":[{"name":"Tengmeng Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Tengmeng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37288934700"},{"name":"Mike E.

Using the SOoA, it becomes possible to design schemes tailored to a given excitation spectrum in order to reduce the overall error. While the conventional OoA is related to a special case of the SOoA, defined about the origin of the dispersion curve, the general definition of the SOoA applies to cases where the OoA is undefined. Since the OoA becomes irrelevant for a pulse whose spectrum does not have a DC component, it can be traded for higher accuracy in terms of numerical dispersion errors. The SOoA concept consolidates and simplifies the methodology reported in [1] and [2]. This methodology is shown to encompass both existing [3] and new schemes. Numerical examples demonstrate the improvement in long term errors for a modulated pulse.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619355","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619355.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The spectral order of accuracy: A unified ool for designing excitation-adaptive wave equation FDTD schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619355/","displayDocTitle":"The spectral order of accuracy: A unified ool for designing excitation-adaptive wave equation FDTD schemes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619355/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The spectral order of accuracy: A unified ool for designing excitation-adaptive wave equation FDTD schemes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s232p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035906S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619356,"authors":[{"name":"Maksims Abalenkovs","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Maksims","lastName":"Abalenkovs","id":"38188794200"},{"name":"Fumie Costen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Fumie","lastName":"Costen","id":"37284180000"},{"name":"Craig Lucas","affiliation":["Research Computing Services, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Lucas","id":"38186362000"},{"name":"Anthony Brown","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Brown","id":"37277558500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619356","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Production","Fitting","Linux","Libraries","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data format selection","I/O-intensive large-scale FDTD","ultra wide band systems","numerical simulation","waveform distortion","finite difference time domain","processor elements"]}],"abstract":"One of the bottle-necks of the large-scale FDTD calculation is the data I/O.

HDF5 is compared with the ASCII format and the binary formats from the perspective of the computational efficiency. It becomes clear that HDF5 is beneficial when more than 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n PEs are used and more than 1 GB of data in ASCII format are produced. The effect of the number of files on the datafile production time as seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3 is under investigation for the presentation in the conference. Since it is difficult to install and maintain scientific format libraries, they are usually not present on wide-access HPC systems. This means high portability of the code using any scientific format is currently not achievable.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619356","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619356.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data format selection for an I/O-intensive large-scale FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619356/","displayDocTitle":"Data format selection for an I/O-intensive large-scale FDTD","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219631","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619356/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data format selection for an I/O-intensive large-scale FDTD","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s232p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067683S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619362,"authors":[{"name":"T.

While these arrays possess beneficial properties, their performance is basically limited by the corresponding set of prototiles that make up the tiling, i.e. the arrays tend to lack design flexibility. A design technique was recently introduced that circumvents this limitation of these arrays by incorporating additional parameters into the basic tiling generation process. With only a small number of parameters it is possible to greatly vary the geometry, and consequently the radiation properties, of aperiodic tiling arrays. This technique has been combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate planar arrays with bandwidths up to 22:1. With successful single-objective optimizations carried out, a natural extension of this technique is to expand its application to multiobjective designs. In this paper examples will be presented for arrays that were optimized to achieve two design objectives: a desired number of elements within a given aperture and minimum sidelobes at a specified frequency. The conventional GA that was utilized in the single-objective optimizations was replaced by a multiple objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), which is much more adept at handling such a design problem. Optimized array examples with bandwidths up to 7.35:1 and a targeted number of elements will be presented.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619362","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619362.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization in the design of broadband arrays based on aperiodic tilings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization in the design of broadband arrays based on aperiodic tilings","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10219871","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619362/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization in the design of broadband arrays based on aperiodic tilings","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s233p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035637S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4619363,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The array of antennas samples the reflected field at a fixed set of locations. The received data are then processed using signal processing techniques such as beamforming to produce an image characterizing the distribution of the objects in the field of view of the active array imaging system. For some applications, as in through-wall microwave imaging, the scene to be imaged is often illuminated with wideband signals to achieve good range resolution. For such imaging problems, the concept of coarrays may be used to facilitate array signal processing issues in a simplified context [1, 2], resulting in a Point Spread Function, PSF(thetas, phi), which is not only a function of weights at the coarray elements but also a function of the wideband signal spectrum, S(omega). For high resolution imaging, it is desirable to synthesize the weights and S(omega), to achieve a desired PSF distribution, for example one with certain beam shape and/or with tapered side lobe levels. This could be potentially a challenging non-linear optimization problem, consisting of a very large number of optimization parameters, and is different from the standard narrow-band fixed antenna array problem, which maybe solved by traditional array synthesis techniques. Evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GAs), evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are well suited for this class of problems.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619366","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619366.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of wideband imaging beamformers using evolutionary programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619366/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of wideband imaging beamformers using evolutionary programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619366/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10204249","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of wideband imaging beamformers using evolutionary programming","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s233p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036085S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4619368,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular since the final user of these antenna is a radar system whose beam is scanned as a function of the frequency, the frequency squint that was observed in Fig. 3 should not be considered a disadvantage.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619390.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leaky-wave slot array antenna fed by a dual reflector system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619390/","displayDocTitle":"Leaky-wave slot array antenna fed by a dual reflector system","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219430","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leaky-wave slot array antenna fed by a dual reflector system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s302p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037563S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4619401,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Performances of these multiple antenna systems largely depend on the correlation between received signals. To maximize the capacity, the correlation must be as low as possible. Spatial diversity is usually used to decrease this correlation. The antenna system presented in this paper is composed of four co-located antennas which are able to produce uncorrelated signals by using both magnitude and polarization diversities. Furthermore, the structure is planar and contains a ground plane which is well-suited to be integrated in a communicant terminal. The diversity potential of the structure is quantify by calculating the envelope correlation between each radiation pattern. The coupling between each access has been decreased by using vias for confinement modes.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619401","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four co-located antennas for MIMO systems with a low mutual coupling using mode confinement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Four co-located antennas for MIMO systems with a low mutual coupling using mode confinement","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619401/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219547","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four co-located antennas for MIMO systems with a low mutual coupling using mode confinement","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s304p1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157845S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619403,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Honma","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoki Honma","id":"37277559500"},{"name":"Kentaro Nishimori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Kentaro Nishimori","id":"37264894100"},{"name":"Riichi Kudo","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Riichi Kudo","id":"37319844500"},{"name":"Yasushi Takatori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasushi Takatori","id":"37265912800"},{"name":"Kazuyasu Okada","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazuyasu Okada","id":"37310993700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619403","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"In this paper, a deterministic solution for controlling reactively steerable antenna, which requires extremely a few channel trainings, has been proposed.

The approach is based on the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) for the field computation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619472.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast ray-tracing for computing n-bounces between curved surfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Ray tracing","Surface waves","Reflection","Algorithm design and analysis","Antennas and propagation","Diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","conductors (electric)","dielectric materials","electromagnetic wave propagation","geometrical theory of diffraction","ray tracing","surface structure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast ray-tracing","curved surfaces","antennas onboard complex structures analysis","indoor-outdoor environments","planar surfaces","electrical conductors","dielectric materials","parametric surfaces","nonuniform rational b-spline surfaces","uniform theory of diffraction","n-bounces"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast ray-tracing for computing n-bounces between curved surfaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619472/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219763","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast ray-tracing for computing n-bounces between curved surfaces","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s315p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0458S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4619476,"authors":[{"name":"Naoya Kukutsu","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoya Kukutsu","id":"37087212951"},{"name":"Akihiko Hirata","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Akihiko Hirata","id":"37087213142"},{"name":"Toshihiko Kosugi","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshihiko Kosugi","id":"37087212826"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Takahashi","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroyuki Takahashi","id":"37087212556"},{"name":"Ryoichi Yamaguchi","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Ryoichi Yamaguchi","id":"37087214075"},{"name":"Tadao Nagatsuma","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan","Osaka University, Japan"],"lastName":"Tadao Nagatsuma","id":"37087212440"},{"name":"Yuichi Kado","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuichi Kado","id":"37087213141"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619476","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optics","microwave photonics","millimetre wave generation","MMIC","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless link systems","photonic technologies","photonic millimeter-wave generator","photonic transmitter core","radio-over-fiber system","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","frequency 120 GHz","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619476","abstract":"We have developed two types of 10-Gbit/s wireless link systems using the 120-GHz band.

The key procedure is to cut an asymmetric edge slot on one of the cross slot antenna elements, such that a combination of single- and dual-band operation cross slot antennas are produced and they become the basic radiating elements of the dual-band cube.

One of the significant challenges of such systems lays on the design of multifunctional radiators. UWB antenna apertures (arrays) can meet the demands of such designs because they offer large bandwidth, gain and scan volume and can be easily reconfigured by dynamically partitioning the aperture and controlling the element or sub-array excitation. Among others, dual-polarized tapered slot (Vivaldi) arrays are very attractive candidates because they offer large bandwidths (4:1 and upwards), scan volume (typical 50deg-elevation) and polarization diversity. The design of such arrays has been traditionally done using ldquoperiodic cellrdquo (infinite array) approximations in conjunction with full-wave (FEM or BEM) solvers, because large computational savings in terms of meshing and solution are achieved [1]. Infinite array approximation, although very successful for large arrays, it ignores truncation effects, that can have prominent affects at the lower bands of UWB antennas. Moreover, in a multifunctional aperture setting, periodic cell solutions can not be used to predict important design merits such as inter or intra array or sub-array coupling. Presently, the study of such affects has been done either using experiments [4] or supercomputer simulations using traditional full-wave methods eg. FEM, BEM and FDTD [2] The purpose of this paper is to firstly study the radiation behavior of isolated finite arrays under various excitations by quantifying truncations effects, and secondly to quantify inter-array coupling effects. Simulations will be done on commodity workstations via a rigorous yet efficient domain decomposition finite element (DD-FEM) method proposed in [3].","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619542","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619542.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation and coupling studies of finite-size dual polarized vivaldi arrays using a domain decomposition FEM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiation and coupling studies of finite-size dual polarized vivaldi arrays using a domain decomposition FEM","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619542/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219808","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619542/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation and coupling studies of finite-size dual polarized vivaldi arrays using a domain decomposition FEM","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s325p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042954S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4619575,"authors":[{"name":"Lai-Ching Ma","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Lai-Ching Ma","id":"37278560600"},{"name":"Raj Mittra","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Raj","lastName":"Mittra","id":"37281104600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619575","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"Two-dimensional periodic structures, that exhibit spatial filtering characteristics, find a variety of applications in defense as well as communication. Several PBC/FDTD schemes have been proposed for analyzing such structures. By incorporating the PBC, which takes advantage of the periodicity inherent in the geometry as well as the excitation, the simulation of the original problem is reduced to that of a single unit cell, considerably simplifying the process. However, the simulation time may still be extensive because of the multiple reflections that might occur, especially when the periodic structure is comprised of multiple screens, and the waves can bounce back and forth between them. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel implementation of the PBC/FDTD based on the split-field formulation, which can significantly reduce the total simulation time when multiple processors are used. For truncating the open boundary of the computational domain, the convolutional PML (CPML) has certain advantages over other types of PML, namely that it is numerically-efficient and essentially independent of the material that it terminates. In this work, we propose a stable implementation of CPML in the PBC/FDTD algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619575.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementation of the periodic boundary condition (PBC) in the FDTD for the investigation of spatial filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Program processors","Mathematical model","Periodic structures","Reflection","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave reflection","finite difference time-domain analysis","frequency selective surfaces","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic boundary condition","spatial filters","multiple reflections","frequency selective surface","two-dimensional periodic structures","PBC/FDTD algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementation of the periodic boundary condition (PBC) in the FDTD for the investigation of spatial filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619575/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219441","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementation of the periodic boundary condition (PBC) in the FDTD for the investigation of spatial filters","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s332p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05481S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4619580,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Hsiang Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Hsiang Su","id":"37293142600"},{"name":"Chih-Wen Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Wen Kuo","id":"37279591200"},{"name":"T.

The most popular technique for eliminating these scan blindnesses is based on the use of electric walls in the grid of the two dimensional array. In this paper we present a dual polarized ultra-wide band array based on dasiabunny earspsila antennas from 0.3 GHz to 1 GHz which presents scan blindness. We analyze the cause of the anomaly and present a technique non based on electric walls in order to avoid the scan blindness with a small increase in the noise figure of the array.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619657.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of scan impedance anomalies in ultra-wide band phased arrays of differentially fed tapered slot antenna elements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistors","Blindness","Antenna arrays","Antennas","Phased arrays","Antennas and propagation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna phased arrays","slot antenna arrays","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scan impedance anomalies elimination","ultra-wide band phased arrays antenna","differential fed tapered slot antenna elements","scan blindnesses","electric walls","frequency 0.3 GHz to 1 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of scan impedance anomalies in ultra-wide band phased arrays of differentially fed tapered slot antenna elements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619657/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219771","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of scan impedance anomalies in ultra-wide band phased arrays of differentially fed tapered slot antenna elements","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s414p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036202S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4619658,"authors":[{"name":"Ozlem Kilic","affiliation":["Catholic University of America, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Ozlem","lastName":"Kilic","id":"37266349400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619658","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Interference","Satellites","Phased arrays","Antennas","Bandwidth","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","electromagnetic interference","satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference analysis","spot beam partitioning","cellular satellite communication systems","satellite antenna","system requirements"]}],"abstract":"It is observed that the sub-beam approach will reduce the gain requirements by 3 dB and 3.6 dB or partition factors of four and seven, respectively. This implies more than 50% reduction in the aperture size. The interference study shows that the partition factor of seven results in high levels of interference as the sub-beams are defined at only 0.4 dB down relative to the peak, and the half power beamwidth is quite broad so that spatial isolation can not work favorably to reduce interference levels. However, the partition factor of four produces similar interference levels as the spot beam configuration (26.92 versus 26.87) using only half of the aperture size. The investigation shows that the spot beam partitioning is a good technique to reduce the antenna size while maintaining the system requirements, such as edge gain and center to center interference.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619658","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619658.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference analysis for spot beam partitioning in cellular satellite communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619658/","displayDocTitle":"Interference analysis for spot beam partitioning in cellular satellite communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219813","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619658/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference analysis for spot beam partitioning in cellular satellite communication systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s414p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08601S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4619662,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Hang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Hu Hang","id":"37087173127"},{"name":"Lei Lili","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Lei Lili","id":"37087251675"},{"name":"Hu Yi","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hu Yi","id":"37087366711"},{"name":"Wu Qun","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Wu Qun","id":"37087250510"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619662","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Arrays","Neodymium","Optimization","Radar","Genetics","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","genetic algorithms","interference suppression","phased array radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subarray weighting method","sidelobe suppression","difference pattern","genetic algorithm","phased array","digital weighting","optimization method","Bayliss weight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subarray weighting","genetic algorithm","sidelobe suppression","difference pattern"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619662","abstract":"This paper studies the method for sidelobe suppression of difference pattern at subarray level in phased array. Sidelobe suppression of difference pattern by digital weighting at subarray level takes advantage that the hardware cost and complexity can be reduced effectively. The optimization method for subarray weights based on genetic algorithm is presented. In order to avoid being constrained on local optimal solution of genetic operation, we partition the genetic optimization process into two stages. Bayliss weight is adopted as objective function for the first stage and parameters of pattern for the second one. Compared with conventional GA, the improved GA achieves better sidelobe suppression performance.

These novel material models enabled the development of ABCs that were perfectly matched to lossy dielectric materials.

Compared to their differential equation counterparts, these solvers automatically impose radiation conditions, do not require unknown fields to be discretized throughout homogeneous volumes, and are highly immune to numerical dispersion. Among their many incarnations, marching on in time, time domain electric field integral equation (MOT-TDEFIE) solvers remain the most widely used. Unfortunately MOT-TDEFIE solvers often are plagued by DC instabilities, i.e. constant and linear-in-time solutions of MOT-TDEFIE systems that reside in the null space of the (non-causal) TDEFIE operator. In the past, these instabilities have been partially cured by using loop-tree decompositions [1] and by enforcing boundary conditions on normal magnetic field components [2]. Unfortunately, neither technique completely annihilates the static null space of the TDEFIE operator, nor guarantees that MOT-TDEFIE solutions are free of DC remnants. In this paper, a modified TDEFIE that resolves static and linear-in-time currents is presented. The equation is obtained by leveraging the time domain Calderon identities in conjunction with the ldquodot-trickrdquo, viz. a careful rearrangement of temporal derivative operators appearing in sequences of TDEFIE operators. The effectiveness of the dottrick TDEFIE for both open and closed structures is demonstrated theoretically, proving the resonance free behavior of the dottrick TDEFIE, and numerically.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619766","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The \u201cdottrick TDEFIE\u201d: a DC stable integral equation for analyzing transient scattering from PEC bodies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The \u201cdottrick TDEFIE\u201d: a DC stable integral equation for analyzing transient scattering from PEC bodies","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619766/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10219395","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4619766/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The \u201cdottrick TDEFIE\u201d: a DC stable integral equation for analyzing transient scattering from PEC bodies","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s433p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04268S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619787,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The decoupling and matching network consist of only reactive elements so that it does not dissipate the input power. For dual-band antenna, it is usually easier to have high isolation in high frequency band (5 GHz) due to its short wave length. Therefore, the decoupling design can be turned to improve low frequency band and not to influence the high frequency band as much as possible. Besides, the matching circuit is still required to match both low and high bands for maintaining good impedance matching. Measurement results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed configuration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two nearby dual-band antennas with high port isolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Dual band","Antenna measurements","Impedance matching","Periodic structures","Microstrip","Microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance matching","multifrequency antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-band antennas","high port isolation","decoupling method","IEEE 802.11 a/b/g WLAN","matching circuit","impedance matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Two nearby dual-band antennas with high port isolation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619893/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204591","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two nearby dual-band antennas with high port isolation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s507p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034816S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4619898,"authors":[{"name":"Mircea Hossu","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Hossu","id":"38273270600"},{"name":"S.

Conventional time-modulated arrays employ switching schemes in which each element of the array has a common start time and an switch-off time which varies according to a prescribed amplitude taper. In this paper we have examined switching strategies in which the element dasiaswitch-onpsila time can be arbitrary. This approach introduces an extra design variable and can be used to modify the sidelobe pattern of the array pattern at harmonic frequencies. In particular we have shown that relatively simple switching schemes can be used to generate a boresight null at harmonic frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619900","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619900.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619900","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of the harmonic radiation patterns of time-modulated antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Control of the harmonic radiation patterns of time-modulated antenna arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619900/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204651","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of the harmonic radiation patterns of time-modulated antenna arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s508p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033675S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4619901,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Montesinos","affiliation":["University of Toulouse-ISAE, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Montesinos","id":"37700715900"},{"name":"Olivier Besson","affiliation":["University of Toulouse-ISAE, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Besson","id":"37274638700"},{"name":"Cecile Guiraud","affiliation":["THALES ALENIA SPACE, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Cecile","lastName":"Guiraud","id":"37563809500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2041-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2042-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"4619901","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619901","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Array signal processing","Loading","Sensors","Gain","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","gradient methods","interference suppression","jamming","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","satellite communications","geostationary satellite system","jammers","interferences suppression","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","iterative conjugate gradient","orthogonal projections","directions-of-arrival"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619901","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619901.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for large arrays in satellite communications","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on adaptive beamforming applied to a geostationary satellite system working in the Ka-band. Given a user of interest, all users of the system using the same frequency appear as jammers. Unknown sources might also interfere with the system. Adaptive beamforming provides the system with the suppression of interferences. Given the high number of sensors, computational load must be accounted. Our goal is therefore to design adaptive beamformers that yield the best signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at lower possible cost.

The results obtained show that only at short distances MIMO-UWB systems exploit a significant multiplexing gain. This is mainly due to the SNR of UWB communications. Since the bit rate of UWB at short distances is already very high, non-negligible improvements can be obtained only at large distances. Consequently, MIMO techniques in UWB systems should be devoted to exploit the diversity gain to increase the communication range. Moreover, it should considered that the variations of the environment conditions could change the working region of the MIMO-UWB system with a decreasing of the achievable gain. In order to avoid such an event, smart techniques should be taken into account to adaptively reconfigure the system itself thus ensuring the best SNR conditions for reaching the optimal gain performance.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2008.4619924","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604650/4618896/04619924.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2008.4619924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4618896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental channel characterization of a MIMO-UWB communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4619924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4619924/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental channel characterization of a MIMO-UWB communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10204197","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4619924/","conferenceDate":"5-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental channel characterization of a MIMO-UWB communication system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s512p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038806S","chronDate":"5-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604650","isNumber":"4618896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604650","xplore-issue":"4618896","articleId":"4619924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4619941,"authors":[{"name":"M.
