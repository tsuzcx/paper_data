An estimate of the source distribution can also be obtained by the use of the truncated inverse Fourier transform. A quantitative measure is obtained of the reductions in the mean-squared error in the estimates which are produced by the data processing techniques. The relative merits of the two processing techniques depend upon the aperture size and the signal-to-noise ratio. The processing of data by means of the wave functions is found to be more advantageous for small apertures and for large signal-to-noise ratios. The processing techniques are also compared as to the ability to reconstruct the detail in an isolated target or source distribution of limited size. The wave functions are shown to be useful for the processing of data obtained from a large aperture that is used to observe a small target.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1972.1140169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25505/01140169.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1972.1140169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar mapping: Prolate spheroidal wave functions versus truncated inverse fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1140169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140169/","displayDocTitle":"Radar mapping: Prolate spheroidal wave functions versus truncated inverse fourier transform","volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar mapping: Prolate spheroidal wave functions versus truncated inverse fourier transform","sourcePdf":"01140169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040245S","chronDate":"Mar 1972","isNumber":"25505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1140169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1140171,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The study is mainly concerned with anomalous wave nulls and their relation to endfire surface-wave radiation, and in addition some data is presented to demonstrate the scan matching properties of the fence geometry. An interesting new development in open periodic structure theory is reported and is shown to apply to both surface waves and anomalous waves. Certain restrictions on the phase distributions of the aperture fields and fence currents are revealed and their origin outlined briefly. These restrictions are introduced to further emphasize relationships between surface and anomalous waves. In addition to these basic relationships, a numerical study of the scanning properties of waveguide-fence arrays is presented which has indicated that structures of this type can reduce impedance variation during scan and can be especially useful when it is desirable to scan very near to, or in the limited scan case, beyond the point at which a grating lobe moves into real space.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25505/01140171.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1972.1140171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1972.1140171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1140171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface waves and anomalous wave radiation nulls on phased arrays of TEM waveguides with fences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Surface waves","Planar waveguides","Geometry","Apertures","Rectangular waveguides","Periodic structures","Surface impedance","Arrayed waveguide gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Phased arrays","Waveguide arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1972","displayDocTitle":"Surface waves and anomalous wave radiation nulls on phased arrays of TEM waveguides with fences","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1972","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface waves and anomalous wave radiation nulls on phased arrays of TEM waveguides with fences","sourcePdf":"01140171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036059S","chronDate":"Mar 1972","isNumber":"25505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1140171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1140179,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The network formulation of antenna arrays is found to be a convenient and useful approximation. Two main effects of coupling are separately considered. The first is the increase in the sidelobe level. A new solution for the distribution of sidelobe level has been obtained which is applicable even for small arrays. It is found that the increase in sidelobe level is noticeable only for small average spacing (e.g., less than 2.5 wavelengths). The second effect of coupling is that it causes the fluctuation of main-beam amplitude as a function of the scan angle. The probabilistic properties of these fluctuations are studied. In the uniformly spaced arrays the accumulation of coupling effects may cause \"blind angles\". In random arrays this accumulation is highly improbable. This method of removing blind angles is further illustrated by an experiment on diffraction gratings where Wood's anomalies and blind angles are recognized as identical phenomena. Finally, an important contribution of this investigation is the analysis by various methods of the radiation pattern of random array. The results obtained by these methods agree remarkably well with the Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1972","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1972","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mutual coupling in phased arrays of randomly spaced antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual coupling in phased arrays of randomly spaced antennas","sourcePdf":"01140188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037639S","chronDate":"May 1972","isNumber":"25506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1140188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":1140193,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For the first time small scale statistics of the multipath propagation for vehicle travel distances on the order of 30 m along streets are presented in the following forms: 1) average power-delay profiles made up of over 200 individual profiles, 2) cumulative distributions of signal amplitude at fixed delays, and 3) radio frequency Doppler spectra at fixed delays. Delay spreads for typical suburban streets are on the order of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.25 \\mu</tex>\ns.

The purpose of this paper is to point out the advantage of the plane-wave spectrum (PWS) approach for analysis of antenna near fields. The advantage of the PWS approach over aperture-integration techniques is quite substantial throughout the entire near-field region for circular apertures. Furthermore, the advantage increases in proportion to closeness to the aperture. The PWS approach also appears to offer advantage for noncircular apertures, e.g., rectangular, at least for large aperture sizes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25517/01140448.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1973.1140448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1973.1140448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1140448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-field analysis by the plane-wave spectrum approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Horn antennas","Antenna theory","Electrons","Electromagnetic reflection","Nonuniform electric fields","Electromagnetic analysis","Hafnium","Dipole antennas","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Aperture antennas","Electromagnetic diffraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1973","displayDocTitle":"Near-field analysis by the plane-wave spectrum approach","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field analysis by the plane-wave spectrum approach","sourcePdf":"01140448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042042S","chronDate":"Mar 1973","isNumber":"25517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1140448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1140479,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Shing Chu","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Ta-Shing Chu","id":"37363063300"},{"name":"R.

The cross polarized radiation of horn reflector and open Cassegrainian antennas rises sharply to rather high values off the beam axis; however, in general, the maximum cross polarized radiation of offset reflector antennas can be made small by using a small angle between the feed and reflector axes. The cross polarization caused by offset is compared with that caused by an unbalanced feed pattern. The effect of the longitudinal current distribution and of departure of the surface from a paraboloid on cross polarization are also examined.

The distribution is compared to that of a set of 170 random arrays. Both distributions are found to be nearly log normal with the same average and median values. They differ markedly in their standard deviations, however, the standard deviation of the random array distribution (1.1 dB) is approximately half that of the algorithmic group.

The method is derived by first expanding both the field radiated by the antenna and the field radiated by the measurement probe, when it is used as a transmitter, into cylindrical wave expansions. The Lorentz reciprocity theorem is then used to solve for the field radiated by the antenna from the probe output voltage. It is shown rigorously that the antenna pattern can be determined independently of the characteristics of the measurement probe provided that certain calibration data are known.

The eigencurrents are shown to provide bases for the irreducible representations of the symmetry group.

Transmission loss estimates for the bistatic scatter path were computed using the weather radar data, the bistatic radar equation, and a model for the scattering cross section per unit volume of rain based upon Rayleigh scattering by an ensemble of water spheres. The measured and estimated transmission loss values were compared to test the use of the scattering model for the estimation of interference. The averaged ratio of measured-to-calculated transmission loss for the 4.5 GHz data is 1.2\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\pm 0.4</tex>\ndB.

The analysis is based on the magnetic-field integral equation simplified to account for rotational symmetry. A technique is developed for the numerical evaluation of the natural frequencies and modes of a perfectly conducting rotationally symmetric body. The technique is used in a numerical sample calculation of natural frequencies and modes of a prolate spheroid. The general method of treating transient electromagnetic scattering problems developed previously is specialized to perfectly conducting bodies of revolution. In particular, scattering of a step-function plane wave from a prolate spheroid is treated numerically. The time response of the induced surface current is constructed from the natural modes in the same way as in network theory. The convergence of the solution, as the number of modes is increased, is also considered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Frequency","Magnetic separation","Wire","Current distribution","Magnetic analysis","Time factors","Electromagnetic transients","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Electromagnetic transient scattering","Transient electromagnetic scattering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.1974.1140779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25529/01140779.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1974.1140779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural-mode representation of transient scattering from rotationally symmetric bodies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1140779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Natural-mode representation of transient scattering from rotationally symmetric bodies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140779/","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural-mode representation of transient scattering from rotationally symmetric bodies","sourcePdf":"01140779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024568S","chronDate":"Mar 1974","isNumber":"25529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1140779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1140783,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This causes a loss in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and in radar range resolution (a broadening of the compressed-pulse width). Depending on the choice of the receiver matched filter (MF) and weighting filter (WF) one or the other of these effects may be minimized. The effects of dispersion in a square planar array with either a parallel feed or a center-fed series feed are studied. Loss in S/N ratio and in range resolution are determined for typical cases, and general curves are given for arrays with arbitrary size, scan range, and signal bandwidth. It is shown that there is an optimum or maximum-useful signal bandwidth for each array, for which the minimum S/N-loss MF-WF design is the same as the ideal-compressed-pulse-shape MF-WF design. For pulses having greater signal bandwidths, time delay steering should be used in the array.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1974.1140807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25530/01140807.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"426","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1974.1140807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relation of radar range resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to phased-array bandwidth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1974","displayDocTitle":"Relation of radar range resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to phased-array bandwidth","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1974","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relation of radar range resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to phased-array bandwidth","sourcePdf":"01140807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037012S","chronDate":"May 1974","isNumber":"25530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1140807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1140809,"authors":[{"name":"J.

When the polarization aspects of the antenna and scene are carefully observed, the resulting integral expression for the antenna temperature differs significantly from that reported for polarization invariant temperature distributions. It is observed that the antenna couples to both emitted surface polarizations, and the phase character of the antenna introduces a term involving the product of the polarized and cross-polarized antenna patterns. A matrix approximation of the integral expression is suggested and developed as a means for inverting polarized antenna temperature observations for the underlying partially polarized apparent temperature distributions. The resulting matrix formulation is interpreted and special cases are treated. By means of sample cases, the cross-coupling effect between the antenna and the emitted field polarization vectors is illustrated. When the polarization aspects of the radiometer and the scene are ignored, inversions for the apparent temperature are shown to suffer appreciably even for a highly efficient antenna. The sensitivity of the matrix inversion technique to errors in the measurement vector is also examined.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25530/01140809.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1974.1140809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1974.1140809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1140809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The recovery of polarized apparent temperature distributions of flat scenes from antenna temperature measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Temperature distribution","Layout","Temperature measurement","Ocean temperature","Antenna theory","Microwave radiometry","Temperature sensors","Atmosphere","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Microwave radiometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1974","displayDocTitle":"The recovery of polarized apparent temperature distributions of flat scenes from antenna temperature measurements","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The recovery of polarized apparent temperature distributions of flat scenes from antenna temperature measurements","sourcePdf":"01140809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031443S","chronDate":"May 1974","isNumber":"25530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1140809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1140845,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Some data are also given on relative power, as a function of polarization, contained in the two distinctly different fluctuation spectra observed. The fast fluctuations are from wind ripples, and the slower fluctuations are strongly dependent on the sea structure. The information on fluctuations is given as support of a two-scatterer concept for sea echo. The scatterers are: 1) a wind-dependent fine structure of the sea (ripples) interspersed with 2) smooth areas (facets) of the wave structure. The composite theory for rough surfaces developed recently in both the United States and the Soviet Union predicts that average radar cross section of sea echo for transmitting and receiving horizontal polarization never exceeds that for vertical polarization. However, measurements at near grazing incidence yield average HH cross sections that sometimes exceed average VV cross sections, and the observations reported herein suggest that reflection from facets is the cause. The composite theory includes the facets only in the sense of varying the slope of the waves on which the ripples are located. Therefore, the need is emphasized for a sea echo theory that is applicable to small incidence angles and includes the effects of the facets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1140870/","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1974","displayDocTitle":"On a two-scatterer theory of sea echo","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a two-scatterer theory of sea echo","sourcePdf":"01140870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041658S","chronDate":"Sep 1974","isNumber":"25532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1140870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1140894,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The fundamental idea used to develop the hybrid technique is to modify the usual impedance matrix that characterizes, for example, a wire antenna such that a metallic body or discontinuity on that body is properly accounted for. It is shown in general that one can modify the impedance matrix for any basis and/or weighting functions if one can compute the correct modification to the impedance matrix element. The modification is readily accomplished using the geometrical theory of diffraction and/or geometrical optics. Several example problems are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the technique. First, the canonical problem of a monopole near a conducting wedge is investigated. Second, a monopole at the center of a four-sided and an eight-sided flat plate is considered. Impedance results for the latter case are in good agreement with measurements. Third, a monopole at the center of a circular disc is examined and compared with experimental measurements in the literature, and fourth, the problem of a monopole near a conducting step is solved and the dependence of the input impedance upon the step height shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25540/01141004.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1975.1141004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1975.1141004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid technique for combining moment methods with the geometrical theory of diffraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Moment methods","Physical theory of diffraction","Optical surface waves","Wire","Geometrical optics","Impedance measurement","Laboratories","Frequency","Optical scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Antenna proximity factors","Geometrical diffraction theory","Moment methods","Monopole antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1975","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid technique for combining moment methods with the geometrical theory of diffraction","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid technique for combining moment methods with the geometrical theory of diffraction","sourcePdf":"01141004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053931S","chronDate":"Jan 1975","isNumber":"25540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"162","articleId":"1141004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1141006,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These fluctuations, caused by irregularities between a target and a receiver, bias the angle estimator towards boresight and cause a spread in the measurements of both on- and off-boresight angles. To illustrate the general results simplified expressions are given for Gaussian antenna patterns, targets near boresight, and a simple power-law irregularity spectrum. Comparisons with other models of angular jitter show that the mean square angular fluctuation observed with an amplitude comparison monopulse radar is closely related to the angular fluctuation, which is predicted when the averaging effect of a radar aperture is considered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Fluctuations","Radar antennas","Interference","Radar measurements","Antenna measurements","Rain","Amplitude estimation","Magnetic noise","Radar theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monopulse radar","Radar meteorological factors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.1975.1141029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25541/01141029.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1975.1141029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angular jitter in an amplitude comparison monopulse radar due to turbulence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Angular jitter in an amplitude comparison monopulse radar due to turbulence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141029/","volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angular jitter in an amplitude comparison monopulse radar due to turbulence","sourcePdf":"01141029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038407S","chronDate":"Mar 1975","isNumber":"25541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1141029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1141041,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Since no practical antenna can be built with absolute precision, only optimization in some probabilistic sense of a random performance index appears to be meaningful. The method also generalizes and gives meaning to the concept of regularization used by others. An approximate solution to the probability distribution of the random performance index is obtained. From this several possible senses of optimization may be defined. Several examples in the synthesis of a two-dimensional secant pattern are studied in detail. In general, it may be impractical to build an array with deterministically optimum currents but also next to impossible to even compute the currents accurately. A detailed numerical analysis is given to show possible sources of errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1975","volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Antenna pattern synthesis based on optimization in a probabilistic sense","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna pattern synthesis based on optimization in a probabilistic sense","sourcePdf":"01141043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033235S","chronDate":"Mar 1975","isNumber":"25541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1141043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1141064,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The basis for this method is that the gross structure of a radar target can be identified from scattered fields of the target at harmonic radar frequencies located just in the low resonance region. This is in sharp contrast to many target signature schemes that operate at much higher frequencies and observe many of the details of the target in lieu of its gross features. Multiple frequency radar scattering data and the complex natural resonant frequencies of radar targets are integrated into a predictor-correlator processor. The method is illustrated using as target models both classical shapes and thin-wire configurations of simple geometry. Integral equation programs are utilized to calculate multiple frequency backscatter data for the wire geometries and to deduce the complex natural resonant frequencies of the wire structures. Discrete multiple frequency radar scattering data spanning a particular spectral range are shown to be desirable for optimum capability but discrimination and detection can be achieved using just two near-conventional radars, even if the radars are located at different sites and hence view the target from different aspects.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1975.1141078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25542/01141078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1975.1141078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25542","startPage":"358","endPage":"367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and discrimination of radar targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection and discrimination of radar targets","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and discrimination of radar targets","sourcePdf":"01141078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054914S","chronDate":"May 1975","isNumber":"25542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"97","articleId":"1141078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141083,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To extract the brightness temperature of the water from the antenna temperature, an unstable Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is solved. Fourier transform techniques are used to invert the integral after it is placed into a cross correlation form. Application and verification of the methods to a two-dimensional modeling of a laboratory wave tank system are included. The instability of the ill-posed Fredholm equation is examined and a restoration procedure is included which smooths the resulting oscillations. With the recent availability and advances of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, the method presented becomes very attractive in the evaluation of large quantities of data. Actual radiometric measurements of sea water are inverted using the restoration method, incorporating the advantages of the FFT algorithm for computations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25545/01141180.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1975.1141180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1975.1141180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Fourier transforms for microwave radiometric inversions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Microwave radiometry","Ocean temperature","Brightness temperature","Integral equations","Microwave theory and techniques","Marine technology","Microwave technology","Sea surface","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT","Discrete Fourier transforms (DFT's)","Fredholm integral equations","Microwave radiometry","Sea surface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1975","displayDocTitle":"Application of Fourier transforms for microwave radiometric inversions","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Fourier transforms for microwave radiometric inversions","sourcePdf":"01141180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031173S","chronDate":"Nov 1975","isNumber":"25545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1141180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1141184,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Application of the modeling is presented for instrument landing system (ILS) glide slope arrays. The results show close correlation between the theoretical and experimental DDM and signal patterns. For transverse half-planes the capture effect and sideband reference systems out-perform the null reference, whereas for lateral edges close to the antenna the reverse is shown to be true.

System performance is strongly influenced by the quantity and character of precipitation that occurs over the links of the system. Rain appears to be the precipitation form that accounts for most of the serious attenuation occurrences. It is also for rain that the Scattering theory is most complete. Rain attenuation can be accurately predicted if the drop-size distribution along the propagation path is known. The drop spectrum determines as well the rainfall rate, radar reflectivity, and microwave emission of rain. Consequently, it is possible to make estimates of rain attenuation through indirect measurements by raingauge, radar, and radiometer. Recent experiments have confirmed that these estimates are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. From propagation experiments and studies of the fine-scale structure of rain, data are becoming available on the horizontal extent of heavy rain areas and the way this structure influences system performance. These data have been used to formulate statistical raincell models that permit prediction of the performance of single-path and path-diversity systems. The current status of raincell models is reviewed and suggestions for future research are offered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical rainstorm models: Their theoretical and physical foundations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1976.1141359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25555/01141359.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1976.1141359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1976","displayDocTitle":"Statistical rainstorm models: Their theoretical and physical foundations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical rainstorm models: Their theoretical and physical foundations","sourcePdf":"01141359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090517S","chronDate":"Jul 1976","isNumber":"25555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1141359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1141369,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The main goal of this paper is to present new PWS formulations for the near-fields of strip and circular apertures. Only special cases are developed in detail. For example, the uniform and parabolic aperture distributions are developed for the circular aperture. These new formulations are expressed in terms of either elementary functions or Fresnel integrals.

A larger tolerance on the element location results in the loss of gain and deterioration of the radiation pattern. In a self-cohering phased array, the phasing of the array elements is accomplished closed-loop and adaptively; therefore, no information on the element location is necessary. On the other hand, to scan the adaptively formed beam about the direction of the received wave, which has to be performed open-loop, one requires information on the element locations. In this paper, basic relations pertaining to the open-loop scanning of adaptive antenna arrays of arbitrary geometry are derived for both far-field and near-field scanning problems, and the transition between the two cases and the required accuracy in the knowledge of the same distance are explored. It is shown that the tolerance requirement on the element locations is the conventional tolerance divided by the maximum scan angle. In large systems designed for target imaging, it is shown that the tolerance on element location can be two or more orders of magnitude larger than that in a conventional array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Tolerances in self-cohering antenna arrays of arbitrary geometry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tolerances in self-cohering antenna arrays of arbitrary geometry","sourcePdf":"01141399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035904S","chronDate":"September  1976","isNumber":"25556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1141399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141400,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Data for the study were obtained using the Wide Aperture HF Radio Research Facility (WARF) which is located in the central valley of California and is operated by Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, CA. Eastward-looking transmissions were employed with an operating frequency chosen so as to provide single-hop ionospheric propagation on both the forward and backscatter paths. Digital real-time recordings were taken at eight received subarray outputs. These recordings were then processed off-line using a large general purpose computer. The beamforming methods studied, however, are computationally simple and may be readily implemented in real-time using a commercially available minicomputer. Two adaptive algorithms were studied and in both cases it was shown that signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 10 to 15 dB are readily achieved when adaptive beamforming is compared with conventional, Dolph taper beamforming methods using identical received data in an HF backscatter environment. It was also demonstrated that the time scale of coefficient variation in an adaptive processor operating in this environment is the order of 1 s. Successful tracking of the adaptive algorithm under these conditions was demonstrated. The use of moving target indication (MTI) clutter suppression filters at the subarray outputs, prior to adaptation, was investigated. No significant improvement was observed with the use of these filters on experimental data. Finally, it was shown that the presence of fading nulls can significantly affect the determination of optimal subarray location and spacing in an HF environment. In general, the adaptive beamformer performance was found to be less dependent upon array geometry than was the case for conventional processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1976","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain adaptive beamforming of HF backscatter radar signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain adaptive beamforming of HF backscatter radar signals","sourcePdf":"01141409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075619S","chronDate":"Sep 1976","isNumber":"25556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1141409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141410,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Desired signals utilized were aircraft targets and a fixed, ground-based radar repeater simulating a moving target, while unwanted signals were other-user interference and signals from a separate ground-based radar repeater. It was found that adaptive rejection of unwanted signals was dependent on pointing-angle alignment and that rejection was often increased by removal of the clutter by moving target indicator (MTI) filtering prior to adaptation. For some conditions, Doppler broadening can he produced by the time modulation imposed by continuous adaptation, unwanted-signal rejection with the adaptive beamformer is variable, but side-by-side comparisons obtained at WARF show that adaptive beamforming can reject off-azimuth signals up to 20 dB better than conventional beamforming with a -25 dB Dolph taper.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1976.1141410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25556/01141410.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1976.1141410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"721","endPage":"732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-line adaptive beamforming capability for HF backscatter radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1976","displayDocTitle":"An on-line adaptive beamforming capability for HF backscatter radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141410/","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-line adaptive beamforming capability for HF backscatter radar","sourcePdf":"01141410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030252S","chronDate":"September  1976","isNumber":"25556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1141410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1141411,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Analytical expressions are developed that define the relationship between rate of adaptation and \"misadjustment,\" a dimensionless measure of the difference between actual and optimal performance due to noise in the adaptive process. For a fixed rate of adaptation it is shown that the LMS algorithm, which is the most efficient, has a misadjustment proportional to the number of adaptive parameters, while the DSD and LRS algorithms have misadjustments proportional to the square of the number of adaptive parameters. The expressions developed are verified by computer simulations that demonstrate the application of the three algorithms to system modeling problems, of the LMS algorithm to the cancelling of broadband interference in the sidelobes of a receiving antenna array, and of the DSD and LRS algorithms to the phase control of a transmitting antenna array. The second application introduces a new method of constrained adaptive beamforming whose performance is not significantly affected by element nonuniformity. The third application represents a class of problems to which the LMS algorithm in the basic form described in this paper is not applicable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of adaptive algorithms based on the methods of steepest descent and random search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1976.1141414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25556/01141414.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1976.1141414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1976","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of adaptive algorithms based on the methods of steepest descent and random search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of adaptive algorithms based on the methods of steepest descent and random search","sourcePdf":"01141414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032972S","chronDate":"Sep 1976","isNumber":"25556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"190","articleId":"1141414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141415,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In more recent applications, longer transmitted waveforms have combined with returns from extended clutter and/or strong targets to create a more serious signal cancellation problem. There are several ways in which the adaptive processor can be constrained from responding to desired main lobe target returns while maintaining good cancellation of interference in the sidelobes. This paper examines the major techniques for constraining the response of the adaptive processor, including methods of controlling the response of the array in the absence of external interference. Time domain and frequency domain techniques are discussed. The majority of the discussion is devoted to angle domain techniques such as pilot signals, preadaption spacial filtering, and control loop spatial filtering. Analysis is presented showing the relationship between these techniques. Finally, examples are given showing the effects of these constraints as well as control of the quiescent array pattern.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1976.1141416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25556/01141416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1976.1141416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25556","startPage":"650","endPage":"662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive arrays with main beam constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive arrays with main beam constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1976","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive arrays with main beam constraints","sourcePdf":"01141416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027374S","chronDate":"Sep 1976","isNumber":"25556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"267","articleId":"1141416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1141417,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The specific case of a satellite multiple-beam antenna at synchronous altitude operating over the earth field of view is considered in detail, although the general results are presented so as to be applicable to an arbitrary planar aperture such as a phased array. The multiple-beam antenna offers the large aperture needed for good nulling resolution, while keeping the number of signal ports utilized in any nulling algorithm at a tractable number. Two specific modes of operation are considered: an earth-coverage mode, in which one desires to null a number of interfering sources while realizing the best possible earth-coverage communications link over the remaining earth field of view; and a maximum signal mode, where one desires only to maximize the signal to a specified number of users while nulling the interfering sources. Both cases are treated in detail. Optimum results are derived for an arbitrary planar aperture and compared to what can be accomplished with a fixed set of beams (the case of 7 and 19 beams are considered). For the earth-coverage mode, the quality of the earth-coverage radiation pattern versus beam position must be traded off with the optimum beam position for good nulling-i.e., it will be shown that the set of beams which gives the flatest earth-coverage radiation pattern with no prescribed nulls is not optimum when nulls are to be formed. The optimum beam positioning is determined using the results of two-dimensional sampling theory. Furthermore, the earth-coverage constraint is seen to severely limit the gain available to a signal source near the null, relative to the maximum signal mode. The maximum directivity available to a user in the maximum signal mode is also shown to be a function of beam position. For signal sources close to the edge of the field of view, the directivity available to the source can be significantly less than optimum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Nulling limitations for a multiple-beam antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nulling limitations for a multiple-beam antenna","sourcePdf":"01141441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018318S","chronDate":"Nov 1976","isNumber":"25557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1141441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141445,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular, it is shown that the conventional two-dimensional surface integration can be reduced to a closed form solution. Two applications of these results are presented relative to radar altimetry, namely, radar antenna pointing angle determination and altitude bias correction for pointing angle and surface roughness effects.

The data used for the study were recorded using a bistatic HF radar located in the central valley of California. Eastword-looking transmissions were generated using a continuous sweep-frequency (chirp) format with a sweep repetition rate of 60 Hz. Backscatter signals, produced by a one-hop forward ionospheric path followed by a one-hop ionospheric return path were received using eight adjacent 32-element linear subarrays spanning a total linear aperture of 2.5 km. Single-channel receivers at each of the eight subarrays were employed for deramping and conversion to baseband. The overall system bandwidth was 960 Hz, and a common local oscillator was used for the receivers. All adaptive processing was carried out off-line using digitized data recorded simultaneously at the eight receiver outputs. The objective of the study described in this paper was to compare the results obtained using the receiving system described above with those which would be obtained using quadrature receivers at the subarray outputs. In the latter case, dual common local oscillator injection, with a\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">90\\deg</tex>\nphase difference, is employed to obtain two receiver outputs, (in-phase and quadrature components) for each receiver. The component outputs then each have a bandwidth equal to one-half that of the single-channel receiver or 480 Hz for both the in-phase and quadrature signals. One advantage of quadrature reception is that a single real multiplying weight can be used at the two outputs to obtain a frequency-independent gain and phase-shift across the received bandwidth, a property which is not easily obtained for all azimuths in the single-channel receiver structure. The study described in this paper was undertaken to quantitatively determine the importance of this difference in an adaptive beamforming system. The approach taken was to synthesize quadrature receiver signals from the recorded single-channel data using Hilbert transform methods. Comparisons between the two receiving systems were then carried out using identical data sets. The results obtained illustrate that minor differences (less than 5 dB) exist in the processed outputs provided that the same number of adaptive degrees of freedom are used in the two processors. As a result, decisions as to the specific form of a receiver to be used in an HF radar should be based on considerations relating to ease of implementation rather than the overall performance of the adaptive processor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of quadrature and single-channel receiver processing in adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of quadrature and single-channel receiver processing in adaptive beamforming","sourcePdf":"01141556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028917S","chronDate":"March  1977","isNumber":"25565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1141556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1141571,"authors":[{"name":"Wai Ko","affiliation":["Advanced Programs Laboratories, Hughes Aircraft Company, Canoga Park, CA, USA","Electromagnetics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Wai Ko","id":"37357499700"},{"name":"R.

The method takes advantage of the fact that the Fourier transform of the unknown surface current distribution is proportional to the scattered far-field. A number of asymptotic methods are currently available that provide good approximation to this farfield in a convenient analytic form which is useful for deriving an initial estimate of the Fourier transform of the current distribution. An iterative scheme is developed for systematically improving the initial form of the high frequency asymptotic solution by manipulating the integral equation in the Fourier transform domain. A salient feature of the method is that it provides a convenient validity check of the solution for the surface current distribution by verifying that the scattered field it radiates indeed satisfies the boundary conditions at the surface of the scatterer. Another important feature of the method is that it yields both the induced surface current density and the far-field. Diffraction by a strip (two-dimensional problem) and diffraction by a thin plate (three-dimensional problem) are presented as illustrative examples that demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for handling a variety of electromagnetic scattering problems in the resonance region and above.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach based on a combination of integral equation and asymptotic techniques for solving electromagnetic scattering problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1977.1141571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25565/01141571.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1977.1141571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1977","displayDocTitle":"A new approach based on a combination of integral equation and asymptotic techniques for solving electromagnetic scattering problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach based on a combination of integral equation and asymptotic techniques for solving electromagnetic scattering problems","sourcePdf":"01141571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040673S","chronDate":"Mar 1977","isNumber":"25565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"62","articleId":"1141571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1141620,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Higher order terms provide perturbations to the leading term. The coefficients of the series are independent of the observation angles. Hence, once they are computed, the field may be determined very rapidly at large numbers of points. Initially, a suitable small angle approximation is made that places the radiation integral in the form of a Fourier transform on a circular disk. The theory is then extended such that the results are valid in both the near and the wide angle regions. Application to a rotationally symmetric paraboloid is presented herein. Other applications include the offset and dual reflectors and near- to far-field integrations.

In multiple beam or contour beam antennas, the feed normally consists of an array of identical elements located on a triangular lattice. Taking advantage of this arrangement, a \"cluster\" of feed elements instead of a single element may be used to control each beam. By adjusting the relative excitations of the elements in a cluster, the aperture phase distortion due to the feed displacement may be partially compensated. Two general methods for synthesizing the excitations for a laterally displaced feed cluster are presented. In the first method the excitations are chosen to minimize the weighted phase error in the effective aperture by analytical means. The second method determines the excitations by a gradient optimization algorithm which minimizes the weighted error between an objective and the actual power patterns in the secondary pattern space. The first method is roughly two orders of magnitude more efficient computationally than the gradient optimization algorithm, but not as flexible in application or as precise. Numerical results are presented for cluster feed designs and their application to the synthesis of contour patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25577/01141816.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1978.1141816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1978.1141816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25577","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1141816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of a laterally displaced cluster feed for a reflector antenna with application to multiple beams and contoured patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflector antennas","Antenna feeds","Apertures","Phase distortion","Phased arrays","Antenna arrays","Propulsion","Lattices","Clustering algorithms","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Circular arrays","Multibeam antennas","Offset reflector antennas","Reflector antennas, offset","Shaped-beam antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1141816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1978","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of a laterally displaced cluster feed for a reflector antenna with application to multiple beams and contoured patterns","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of a laterally displaced cluster feed for a reflector antenna with application to multiple beams and contoured patterns","sourcePdf":"01141816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02314S","chronDate":"Mar 1978","isNumber":"25577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1141816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1141821,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The nature of the modulation waveform depends on the orientation and dimensions of the object, its rotation speed, and very strongly on the incident and receiving (or scattering) directions. For a rectangular metal plate rotating in its own plane, the modulation is independent of time in the specular and forward directions. Near the specular and forward directions the modulation waveform is a sinusoidal function having a frequency equal to twice the rotation frequency of the plate. Further away from these directions, the waveform is a sinc-pulse type repeating at twice the rotation frequency. Similar results are also discussed for a rotating skewed metal plate. The observed waveforms are found to be in good agreement with theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1979.1142020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25588/01142020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1979.1142020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25588","startPage":"40","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering of electromagnetic waves by a slowly rotating rectangular metal plate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scattering of electromagnetic waves by a slowly rotating rectangular metal plate","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1979","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering of electromagnetic waves by a slowly rotating rectangular metal plate","sourcePdf":"01142020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044053S","chronDate":"Jan 1979","isNumber":"25588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1142020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1142034,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Electromagnetic fields in such regions can be represented, using the CAP formulation, in terms of two continuous potentials which satisfy a self-adjoint system of partial differential equations or, equivalently, a variational criterion. Using an optimized variational finite-element algorithm in conjunction with a triregional unimoment method, a versatile computer program is described that provides scattering solutions for each of multiple incident fields impinging upon an arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneous penetrable body of revolution.

Given an arbitrary feed pattern, it was shown that the surfaces required to transform this feed pattern by geometrical optics into any specified phase and amplitude pattern in the specified output aperture are found by the integration of two simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For the offset noncoaxial geometry, however, it is shown that the equations found by this method are partial differential equations which, in general, do not form a total differential. Hence the exact solution to this problem is generally not possible. It is also shown, however, that for many important problems the partial differential equations form a nearly total differential. It thus becomes possible to generate a smooth subreflector by integration of the differential equations and then synthesize a main reflector which gives an exact solution for the specified aperture phase distribution. The resultant energy (or amplitude) distribution in the output aperture as well as the output aperture periphery are then approximately the specified values. A representative group of important solutions are presented which illustrate the very good quality that frequently results by this synthesis method.

The field from this array is expanded into plane inhomogeneous waves, and the mutual impedance between the array elements and an exterior arbitrarily oriented element is derived. The formulation is particularly useful when the array is located adjacent to a dielectric interface. Numerical examples are given and the relationship to earlier formulations pointed out. It is further shown that the impedance of a single element can be obtained as the average of the scan impedance taken over the entire hemisphere (called the array scanning method (ASM)).

Numerical evaluation is straightforward when the dipole is in the lossy half-space, and the utility of the method is demonstrated by the presentation of results for the input impedance of dipoles in a variety of half-space environments.

Calculated and measured results show that, with proper design, the dielectric matching layers can be adjusted to produce a biplanar slot array with a wide low-loss passband. Further, the bandwidth will be much less dependent on the incidence angle than in similar arrays without dielectric matching layers. One interesting feature of the investigation was the appearance of an unexpected passband null due to the dielectric filler material which occurs at a lower frequency than any possible Wood's anomaly. This null was first predicted theoretically and later confirmed by measurements. By modifying the spacing between the slots this null can be removed from the passband.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25590/01142110.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1979.1142110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1979.1142110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode matching analysis of biplanar slot arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passband","Geometry","Aerospace electronics","Laboratories","Dielectric measurements","Modal analysis","Reflection","Bandwidth","Dielectric materials","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dielectric-loaded antennas","Mode-matching methods","Planar arrays","Slot arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1979","displayDocTitle":"Mode matching analysis of biplanar slot arrays","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode matching analysis of biplanar slot arrays","sourcePdf":"01142110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021755S","chronDate":"May 1979","isNumber":"25590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1142110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142115,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The radiation pattern, the input impedance of each of the three sections of the antenna system, and the isolation characteristics between all the sections of the SMA are measured and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1979.1142120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25591/01142120.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1979.1142120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slot-monopole antenna system for energy-density reception at UHF","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142120/","displayDocTitle":"Slot-monopole antenna system for energy-density reception at UHF","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slot-monopole antenna system for energy-density reception at UHF","sourcePdf":"01142120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065404S","chronDate":"Jul 1979","isNumber":"25591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1142120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142135,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This surface degradation could be corrected if a subreflector were deformed in a similar shape by the same amount. For testing this possibility an experimental Cassegrain subreflector was built which can be deformed in an astigmatic mode by simple means: two stiff diagonals and four points in-between where a motor pushes or pulls normal to the surface, servo-controlled by the on-line computer. Although the amount of deformation is too limited in the present setup, good results have already been obtained. Seven unresolved radio sources were observed at the water vapor line (22.3 GHz,\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda = 1.345</tex>\ncm), at various telescope pointing, and with different amounts of subreflector deformation, scanning in both directions for complete beam maps.

The pulse has the general characteristics of an EMP. The pulse is observed as it emerges from the plasma as a function of the plasma parameters. As the electron number density increases, it is found that energy is increasingly absorbed from the pulse, a process due to joule heating. In addition, at higher number densities, ringing of the pulse occurs. The nitrogen pressure in these experiments is sufficiently low so that collisions play only a minor role. Also developed is a theoretical model based on the fluid transport equations. This theory predicts that the electrons of the plasma are attaining a temperature of about 15 eV in that part of the system where the dc magnetic field is about 80 G. More importantly, it is able to predict the output pulse quite well under the conditions that the ambient nitrogen pressure and the electron number density are low. The theory appears to fail as these parameters are increased.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1979.1142150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1979.1142150","startPage":"596","endPage":"603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25592/01142150.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Absorption of energy from a large amplitude electromagnetic pulse by a collisionless plasma","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1979","displayDocTitle":"Absorption of energy from a large amplitude electromagnetic pulse by a collisionless plasma","publicationDate":"September 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142150/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absorption of energy from a large amplitude electromagnetic pulse by a collisionless plasma","sourcePdf":"01142150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0449S","chronDate":"Sep 1979","isNumber":"25592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1142150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":1142154,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A theorem by Stangel [1] is generalized, and it is shown that the scan angle limitations of the feed array and of the dome result in an upper bound on the average dynamic gain (scan dependent gain function) and in an upper bound on the gain in any particular scan direction. For specified scan limits, the former bound is determined essentially by the feed array, the latter by the dome size. These bounds are useful in posing realistic performance requirements for dome antennas and have been verified in a few specific examples. Subsequently, the synthesis problem is addressed; an optimization scheme is employed to arrive at a dome insertion phase distribution that produces a desired gain-versus-scan variation.

In many situations only a numerical description of the surface is available rather than an analytical expression which lends itself more readily to a determination of the specular point. The numerically prescribed form for the surface may be locally interpolated each time a specular point is to be calculated. An alternative approach is investigated that circumvents the step of deriving the specular point and obtains the scattered field in a more direct manner. Basically, the method begins by computing the reflected rays off the surface at the points where their coordinates, as well as the partial derivatives (or equivalently, the direction of the normal), are numerically specified. Next, a cluster of three adjacent rays are chosen to define a \"mean ray\" and the divergence factor associated with this mean ray. Finally, the amplitude, phase, and vector direction of the reflected field at a given observation point are derived by associating this point with the nearest mean ray and determining its position relative to such a ray.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1979.1142198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25593/01142198.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1979.1142198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient approach for computing the geometrical optics field reflected from a numerically specified surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142198/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient approach for computing the geometrical optics field reflected from a numerically specified surface","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient approach for computing the geometrical optics field reflected from a numerically specified surface","sourcePdf":"01142198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040115S","chronDate":"Nov 1979","isNumber":"25593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1142198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142247,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Among various possible nearfield scan geometries, the planar configuration has attracted considerable attention. In the past the planar configuration has been used with a probe scanning a rectangular geometry in the near field, and computation of the far field has been made with a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT). The applicability of the planar configuration with a probe scanning a polar geometry is investigated. The measurement process is represented as a convolution derivable from the reciprocity theorem. The concept of probe compensation as a deconvolution is then discussed with numerical results presented to verify the accuracy of the method. The far field is constructed using the Jacobi-Bessel series expansion and its utility relative to the FFT in polar geometry is examined. Finally, the far-field pattern of the Viking high gain antenna is constructed from the plane-polar near-field measured data and compared with the previously measured far-field pattern. Some unique mechanical and electrical advantages of the plane-polar configuration for determining the far-field pattern of large and gravitationally sensitive space antennas are discussed.

The medium is assumed to vary arbitrarily with position, though sufficiently slowly with respect to all wavelengths contained in the source spectrum. For simplicity only one spatial dimension is considered, but the development may be extended to include more space variables. After deducing integral representations that are evaluated asymptotically, the theory is applied to a particular plasma inhomogeneity characterized by an exponential variation of plasma frequency. Space-time rays associated with an impulsive source are shown to justify the use of time-inversion in establishing the required phase of an FM pulse capable of producing an optimally compressed signal at a particular space-time point. Since ordinary asymptotic methods fail in the neighborhood of such a focal point, a theory that in a prior study described signals in the focal region of a homogeneous plasma is applied to signals in a plasma with exponentially varying plasma frequency. Computed results based on this theory display the character of optimally compressed signals in focal regions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1980.1142331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25602","startPage":"342","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25602/01142331.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FM pulses in stratified isotropic plasma","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1980","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"FM pulses in stratified isotropic plasma","publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FM pulses in stratified isotropic plasma","sourcePdf":"01142331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031724S","chronDate":"May 1980","isNumber":"25602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1142331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142364,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Two simple array models, a two-element and a three-element array with dipole element patterns, are used to study this question. The element patterns are assumed unequal (i.e., the beam maxima point in different directions). It is shown that element patterns greatly affect the occurrence of grating nulls in the array. Unequal element patterns cause extra grating nulls (\"sign reversal grating nulls\") to occur, in addition to conventional grating nulls. These sign reversal grating nulls can occur even with element spacing less than a half-wavelength. For a two-element array with dipole element patterns, it turns out that grating nulls cannot be avoided if the spacing is greater than a half-wavelength. However, with more than two elements, the situation is not so bleak.

Special consideration is given to the treatment of edges so that rather arbitrary geometrical configurations may be handled. For the conducting body problems considered, an electric field integral formulation is used, and the method of moments is applied using pulse expansions to represent both the current and the charge. It is demonstrated that proper placement of the current and charge subdomains relative to edges not only is important in treating edges but also yields a convenient numerical procedure. A simple testing scheme is used which is almost as efficient as point-matching. Numerical results indicate that the approach is free of anomalies in the behavior of current near edges and of other previously observed numerical instabilities.

It yields a theory which is simple and inexpensive to apply. The fields in the interior of the antennas are characterized in terms of a discrete set of modes. The poles corresponding to these modes are complex and depend on the losses in the antenna. The representation of the fields in terms of these modes is rigorous only for a bona fide cavity with no copper loss. The proper shift in the complex poles due to the addition of copper and radiative losses is approximated by lumping the latter two together with the dielectric loss to form an effective loss tangent. By so doing, it is found that the resulting expressions for impedance of the microstrip antenna are in good agreement with measured results for all modes and feed locations.

The disk is assumed to have zero thickness, and the current on the probe is taken to be uniform. Using vector Hankel transforms the problem is formulated in terms of vector dual-integral equations, from which the unknown current can be solved for. Due to the singular nature of the current distribution arising from probe excitation, the direct application of Galerkin's basis function expansion method gives a slowly convergent result. Therefore the singular part of the current is removed since the singularity is known a priori. The unknown current to be solved for is then regular and tenable to Galerkin's method of analysis. It is shown that this analysis agrees with the single-mode approximation when the dielectric substrate layer is thin, and that it deviates from the single-mode approximation when the substrate layer is thick. Excellent agreement of both the computed real and imaginary parts of the input impedance with experimental data is noted. The radiation patterns and the current distributions on the disk are also-presented.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1981.1142534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25612/01142534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1981.1142534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"68","endPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a circular microstrip disk antenna with a thick dielectric substrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1981","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a circular microstrip disk antenna with a thick dielectric substrate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142534/","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a circular microstrip disk antenna with a thick dielectric substrate","sourcePdf":"01142534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028961S","chronDate":"Jan 1981","isNumber":"25612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1142534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142535,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The device is low cost, light weight, and has sufficient bandwidth to be of use in a variety of applications. An analytical model is developed which establishes transmission line equivalent circuits for the wire grid elements. Current distributions determined from the model are shown to predict accurately the measured pattern performance of a typical implementation. The bandwidth as established by various pattern parameters is quantitatively assessed. Particular emphasis is given to methods of amplitude control through control of line impedances.

The control is achieved by placing shorting posts at appropriate locations within the antenna's boundaries. By changing the number and locations of the posts, the operating frequency can be tuned over a 1.5-to-1 range, and the polarization can be changed from horizontal to vertical, right-hand circular, or left-hand circular. All of these changes are obtained without significantly altering the input impedance or radiation patterns of the antenna and without increasing the complexity of the external microwave feed network. The frequency and polarization can be electronically controlled by using microwave switching diodes for the shorting posts. Antennas that have two feeds and operate simultaneously in two orthogonal polarizations have been constructed with the capability to switch between linear and circular polarization. Also, a thin frequency-scanned array has been built with the frequency-agile microstrip elements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1981.1142546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25612/01142546.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1981.1142546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip antennas with frequency agility and polarization diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142546/","displayDocTitle":"Microstrip antennas with frequency agility and polarization diversity","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstrip antennas with frequency agility and polarization diversity","sourcePdf":"01142546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08824S","chronDate":"Jan 1981","isNumber":"25612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"233","articleId":"1142546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142549,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The latter technique is discussed, and a special excitation waveform called the \"kill-pulse\" or K-pulse is proposed. By analogy with lumped and distributed networks, a unique aspect-invariant excitation waveform is postulated for an isolated scatterer. This waveform, of finite and minimal duration, then characterizes the pole spectrum of the scatterer as used in the singularity expansion method (SEM) or for target identification. The derivation of this excitation waveform and its relation to one or more surface waves is illustrated by several examples. Using surface waves initiated at certain points of an object, the complex attenuation of circumnavigating waves is estimated by the geometrical theory of diffraction. Three-parameter characteristic equations are derived which predict pole strings with excellent accuracy for conducting spheres and cylinders and lesser accuracy for prolate spheroids of several axial ratios. For spheres and cylinders, the same characteristic equation also yields good estimates of cavity resonance frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The K-pulse concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The K-pulse concept","sourcePdf":"01142561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02357S","chronDate":"Mar 1981","isNumber":"25613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"102","articleId":"1142561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1142571,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Chan","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA","Moore School Graduate Research Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Chi Chan","id":"38226542700"},{"name":"N.

The concepts are illustrated by several examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1981.1142573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25613","startPage":"373","endPage":"379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25613/01142573.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some mathematical considerations in dealing with the inverse problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1981","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Some mathematical considerations in dealing with the inverse problem","publicationDate":"March 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some mathematical considerations in dealing with the inverse problem","sourcePdf":"01142573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031568S","chronDate":"March  1981","isNumber":"25613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"94","articleId":"1142573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142580,"authors":[{"name":"Luen Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Electro Science Laboratory, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA","Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Luen Chan","id":"37087612516"},{"name":"L.

The video pulse system, which utilizes complex natural resonances of the target and a prediction correlation processing, is improved in comparison to the system reported previously by better fitting the system bandwidth to the bandwidth which contains the complex natural resonances of the desired target. The antenna and associated hardware modifications to achieve this are described. Identification performance of the modified system is given using actual buried land mine-like targets. Significant improvement of the quality of the received waveforms and hence the signal-to-clutter ratio is obtained. Potential further improvement is discussed. This may be achieved by removing the natural resonance associated with the antenna from the data prior to the application of the predictor correlator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1981","volume":"29","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Improved performance of a subsurface radar target identification system through antenna design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved performance of a subsurface radar target identification system through antenna design","sourcePdf":"01142580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035725S","chronDate":"Mar 1981","isNumber":"25613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1142580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1142584,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The data are restricted in the sense that the frequencies, aspects, and polarizations are limited. All three solutions are based in part on a fundamental time domain viewpoint whereby the far-zone scattering characteristics of any finite object are uniquely summarized by its impulse response waveforms. Insight provided by these waveforms is exploited via geometrical characteristics extracted from steady-state, forced, and free responses of the object. For the present purposes the fundamental importance of signaling waveforms whose wavelengths are within an order of magnitude of the object dimension is demonstrated. The basic methods discussed have been previously identified in the literature as natural resonance estimation, radar imaging from ramp response signatures, and low frequency classification. Related common features, additional insight, and some new results are given. Applications of all three methods to objects ranging from simple to complex geometries are described.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1981.1142584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25613/01142584.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1981.1142584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient response characteristics in identification and imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transient response characteristics in identification and imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1981","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient response characteristics in identification and imaging","sourcePdf":"01142584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095345S","chronDate":"Mar 1981","isNumber":"25613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","articleId":"1142584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1142585,"authors":[{"name":"W.-M.

In the shadow region the field radiated by the source propagates along Keller's surface diffracted ray path, whereas in the lit region the incident field propagates along the geometrical optics ray path directly from the source to the field point. These ray fields are expressed in terms of Fock functions which reduce to the geometrical optics field in the deep lit region and remain uniformly valid across the shadow boundary transition region into the deep shadow region.

These nulls are generally required to be below some specified level of directive gain over the entire system bandwidth. Typically the nulls are formed by adaptively weighting each output of an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\n-port antenna, such as an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\n-element array. For large arrays operating over wide percentage bandwidths, some sort of frequency compensation is required at each output port to accomplish broad-band nulling. One technique commonly used is to employ a \"tapped\" delay line at each element output, with controllable weights (frequency independent) at the output of each tap. The objective of this paper is to develop some insight into the way in which delay-line compensation leads to improved performance, to develop some quantitative estimates of how performance varies with antenna and delay-line parameters, and to develop some tools useful in the performance evaluation of frequency-dependent weighting. Practical considerations dictate that only a minimum number of taps/ element be utilized. A primary consideration is to minimize the number of taps required for a specific system performance. With this objective in mind, we develop an analytic solution characterizing the two-element array, employing a two-tap delay line with each element. This provides valuable insight into the mechanism of delay-line compensation. Results for this simple case will then be extended to the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\n-element planar array using\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N_{t}</tex>\ntaps/element. Tap spacing which optimizes the array performance from the viewpoint of providing wide-band nulls on sources incident on the array from locations arbitrarily specified over the antenna field of view is developed and applied to numerous types of array configurations. The composite performance of nine specific array configurations is used to estimate the number of taps and tap spacing which would be required for an arbitrary array configuration, as a function of the array and delay-line parameters\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\Delta_{\\gamma m} = (2_{\\pi}D/\\lambda) \\sin \\theta_{m}</tex>\n, FBW,\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\phi_{0}</tex>\n, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N_{t}</tex>\nwhere FBW is the fractional bandwidth\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(100\\ast</tex>\nFWB = percentage nulling bandwidth),\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\theta_{m}</tex>\nis the maximum scan angle off broadside,\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\phi_{0}</tex>\nis the tap spacing (in degrees, relative to the center-band frequency),\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</tex>\nis the maximum aperture dimension, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N_{t}</tex>\nis the number of taps.

An improved procedure of field determination is used which combines Floquet's theorem and the variational principle, thus revealing an additional requirement on the corrugation geometry. Factors influencing a match at the feed mouth, and satisfactory launching of the surface wave are discussed. The degree of suppression of the feed radiation is given in db as a function of the geometry of the system. Approximate radiation patterns are derived for two cases, (a) when the system is terminated by an infinite ground plane, and (b) when the system is terminated by a finite ground plane. For the latter case, an upper bound on the tilt angle of the main beam and a lower bound on its beamwidth result from an approximate theory. For both cases, the Hansen-Woodyard endfire relation is found to provide beam sharpening even when the feed radiation is considered. The presence of higher order surface modes, their effect, and their elimination are discussed. Comparison of the theory with experiment is reasonably good.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AP.1954.27975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25623","startPage":"71","endPage":"81","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8236/25623/01142709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the theory of corrugated plane surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1954","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the theory of corrugated plane surfaces","publicationDate":"April 1954","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of corrugated plane surfaces","sourcePdf":"01142709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038807S","chronDate":"Apr 1954","isNumber":"25623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8236","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1142709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142715,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is shown that when the feed is achieved there results a circular beam cross section which optimizes the efficiency of illumination of a circular aperture. The back radiation from the feed is down 30 db from that in the forward direction, minimizing interference effects between feed and aperture.

The theory is based on the retarded electromagnetic potentials which permit a diakoptic approach to the problem. The antenna is broken up into its individual structure elements. Each element is assumed to be excited by currents which are impressed at its terminals, i.e., junctions with adjacent elements (current coupling) and by the electric fields of the currents and charges on all the other elements (fieid coupling). Both excitations are treated independently. Each impressed current produces a \"dominant\" current distribution, a characteristic of the element, which can be readily computed. Current coupling is formulated by \"intrinsic\" impedance matrices which relate the scaler potentials at the terminals of an element, caused by its dominant current distributions, to the impressed currents of the element. Field coupling produces \"scatter\" currents on all the elements and is formulated by a \"fieid-coupling\" matrix which relates the scalar potentials at the terminals, caused by field coupling, to the impressed currents at all the terminals. Intrinsic and \"field-coupling\" matrices are combined to form the \"complete\" impedance matrix of the diakopted antenna. Enforcing continuity of the currents and equality of the scalar potentials at all the interconnections between the elements yields a system of linear equations for the junction currents and the input impedance of the antenna. Current coupling dominates field coupling. Fieid coupling is primarily affected by the dominant current distributions of the elements, and in general the scatter currents have negligible effect on it. Although detailed numerical investigations will be presented in another paper, a simple example is included here to demonstrate that the diakoptic theory yields very good results even if greatly simplified assumptions are made.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1982","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diakoptic theory for multielement antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diakoptic theory for multielement antennas","sourcePdf":"01142741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019555S","chronDate":"Jan 1982","isNumber":"25626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","articleId":"1142741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142744,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The dipole and its balun are a linearly polarized version of the perimeter array radar (PAR) antenna element, and are modeled in strip-line geometry. Knowledge of the feed region modes is essential in determining the influence of supports on the element scan performance, and should shed light on the formation of blind spots in dipole arrays. It is shown that for practical spacings, the balanced strip-line feed structure supports a propagating transverse magnetic (TM) mode in addition to two transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes. The propagation constant of this mode is scan dependent, and under inappropriate conditions its cutoff occurs before the onset of the grating lobe.

However it cannot always steer one beam and one null toward two prespecified directions simultaneously with a single set of weights. The ability for an array to steer one beam and one or more nulls simultaneously is determined by five factors: 1) element positions, 2) orientations of elements, 3) antenna patterns of elements, 4) polarizations of signals, and 5) directions of the beams and/or nulls. A coefficient is defined, called spatial correlation, which includes these factors and completely characterizes array beam pointing and nulling. Its application to adaptive arrays is demonstrated. The adaptive array performance is dominated by this coefficient and can be improved by properly choosing the first three factors. Several examples on the selection of element placement in adaptive arrays are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1982.1142763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25627/01142763.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial correlations in adaptive arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142763/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial correlations in adaptive arrays","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial correlations in adaptive arrays","sourcePdf":"01142763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032672S","chronDate":"Mar 1982","isNumber":"25627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","articleId":"1142763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142765,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The radar can be organized so as to measure ocean wave height, wave direction, and wave velocity simultaneously for 15 different ocean wavelengths ranging from 150 m to approximately 6 m. An example of such a directional wave intensity spectrum is given. To illustrate the ranging and the identification potential of the technique in regard to airplanes, two different airplane categories, namely a propeller aircraft (Cessna 172) and a rigid jet aircraft (F-16), were flown through the radar beam. The signatures of these two airplanes are show in two signature domains: spatial distribution of scattering centers and motion pattern. The experimental results confirm theories presented in earlier contributions. It remains to introduce two more domains, namely the space/time coherence properties of the target and its polarization characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1982","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A multifrequency adaptive radar for detection and identification of objects: Results on preliminary experiments on aircraft against a sea-clutter background","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multifrequency adaptive radar for detection and identification of objects: Results on preliminary experiments on aircraft against a sea-clutter background","sourcePdf":"01142794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037468S","chronDate":"May 1982","isNumber":"25628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1142794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142804,"authors":[{"name":"B.

These effects result from adaptive interaction between signal and interference, when signal and interference are received simultaneously. Similar phenomena have been observed and analyzed in relatively simple adaptive noise cancelling systems. A study of these phenomena in the simpler systems is used to provide insight into similar behavior in adaptive antennas. A method for alleviating signal cancellation has been devised by Duvall, whereby the signal components are removed from the adaptive process, then reinserted to form the final system output. Widrow has devised a different solution to the problem: to move the receiving array spatially (or electronically) to modulate emanations received off the look direction, without distorting useful signals incident from the look direction. This approach is called \"spatial dither\" and introduces the additional possibility of modulating \"smart\" jammer signals, thereby limiting their effectiveness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25628/01142804.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1982.1142804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal cancellation phenomena in adaptive antennas: Causes and cures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Jamming","Signal processing algorithms","Interference","Noise cancellation","Signal processing","Radar antennas","Spread spectrum radar","Receiving antennas","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1982","displayDocTitle":"Signal cancellation phenomena in adaptive antennas: Causes and cures","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal cancellation phenomena in adaptive antennas: Causes and cures","sourcePdf":"01142804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061109S","chronDate":"May 1982","isNumber":"25628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"236","articleId":"1142804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142817,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Numerical results are presented only for the electrostatic case to illustrate the validity of this procedure which show excellent agreement with other available data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative method for solving electrostatic problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1982.1142833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25629/01142833.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1982","displayDocTitle":"An iterative method for solving electrostatic problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative method for solving electrostatic problems","sourcePdf":"01142833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051245S","chronDate":"July  1982","isNumber":"25629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1142833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142835,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A planar line antenna array and optical system for imaging has been developed by the authors. The significant advances are a \"reverse-microscope\" optical configuration and a modified bow-tie antenna design. In the \"reverse-microscope\" configuration, a lens is attached to the bottom of the substrate containing the antennas. Imaging is done through the substrate. This configuration eliminates the troublesome effects of substrate surface waves. The substrate lens has only a single refracting surface, making possible a virtually aplanatic system, with little spherical aberration or coma. The array is characterized by an optical transfer function that is easily measured. An array with 19 dB crosstalk levels between adjacent antennas has been tested and it was found that the array captured 50 percent of the available power.

The hybriding is based upon a novel use of a field equivalence theorem due to Schelkunoff, which permits a field penetration problem to be analyzed in steps by treating the relatively simple external region and the relatively complex internal region separately. The method involves first, determination of an equivalent short-circuit current excitation in the aperture regions of the structure using MM for a given external illumination. This equivalent current excitation over the aperture is next used to excite the complex loaded interior region, and the penetrating fields and induced currents are computed by the FD-TD method. A significant advantage of this frequency domain/time domain hybriding is that no Green's function need be calculated for the interior region. This hybrid approach takes advantage of the ability of MM to solve exterior problems using patch models and also takes advantage of the ability of FD-TD to model in great detail localized space regions containing metal structures, dielectrics, permeable media, anisotropic or nonlinear media, as well as wires.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1982.1142860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25629/01142860.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid moment method/finite-difference time-domain approach to electromagnetic coupling and aperture penetration into complex geometries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142860/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid moment method/finite-difference time-domain approach to electromagnetic coupling and aperture penetration into complex geometries","volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid moment method/finite-difference time-domain approach to electromagnetic coupling and aperture penetration into complex geometries","sourcePdf":"01142860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043568S","chronDate":"Jul 1982","isNumber":"25629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"84","articleId":"1142860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1142865,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The tracking takes place along phase paths perpendicular to the local phase fronts. The determination of the generally complicated configuration of phase paths constitutes a difficulty in the implementation of EWT. The viability of an approximate scheme is examined whereby the phase paths emanating from the initial surface, on which the field is prescribed, are taken locally as hyperbolas; these are known to represent exact global solutions of a particular canonical evanescent wave problem. Numerical comparisons to be presented elsewhere reveal, however, that the local hyperbolic phase path matching may generally be inadequate even for weakly evanescent fields, although this procedure is effective for certain types of initial conditions. To overcome this difficulty, the solution is obtained from an exact formulation involving field integration over the intital surface and subsequent asymptotic evaluation by the saddle point method. Since the saddle points are complex, the latter procedure is equivalent to an analysis in terms of complex rays, from which one may derive the phase paths of EWT. Therefore complex rays should be used as an algorithm for solving the phase path equations. The rigorous analysis also shows that complex ray theory, or EWT, cannot account for strongly evanescent fields, and that there may exist relevant ray contributions from deep within the complex space that cannot be found by the real-space tracking of EWT.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25629/01142865.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1982.1142865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1142865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evanescent waves and complex rays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical surface waves","Lighting","Surface waves","Equations","Aperture antennas","Antenna theory","Optical reflection","Physical theory of diffraction","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Antennas","Geometrical diffraction theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1982","displayDocTitle":"Evanescent waves and complex rays","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evanescent waves and complex rays","sourcePdf":"01142865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030876S","chronDate":"Jul 1982","isNumber":"25629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1142865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142867,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This scheme consists of synthesizing an aspect-independent waveform for the incident radar signal which excites an arbitrarily oriented target in such a way that the return radar signal from the target consists of only a single natural resonance mode of that target in the late-time period. When the incident waveform synthesized to excite a particular natural mode of a known preselected target is applied to a different target, the return radar signal will be significantly different from that of the expected natural mode. The wrong target can thus be sensitivity discriminated. In this paper, a thin cylinder illuminated by the radar signal at an oblique angle is considered. The impulse response of an arbitrarily oriented wire is approximated analytically. The aspect-independent, required incident-signal waveforms for exciting various single-mode return signals are obtained. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate target-discrimination sensitivity based on this method. Dependence of the required incident waveform upon its duration is studied, and an apparently optimum signal duration is identified.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1982.1142919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25630","startPage":"867","endPage":"880","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25630/01142919.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar waveform synthesis for single-mode scattering by a thin cylinder and application for target discrimination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1982","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Radar waveform synthesis for single-mode scattering by a thin cylinder and application for target discrimination","publicationDate":"September 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar waveform synthesis for single-mode scattering by a thin cylinder and application for target discrimination","sourcePdf":"01142919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0327S","chronDate":"Sep 1982","isNumber":"25630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1142919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1142923,"authors":[{"name":"Shung-Wu Lee","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Shung-Wu Lee","id":"37293438500"},{"name":"G.

In some cases, the nonlinearity causes effects such as the intermodulation products arising from the nonlinear mixing of two frequencies. In other cases, the nonlinearity may be exploited, for example, to reduce late-time ringing on a pulse-excited antenna. A procedure for treating general nonlinear loads is described and illustrated. This procedure is applied using a computer to several specific types of nonlinearities. The treatment within the framework of the thin-wire approximation to the electric field integral equation is developed. As such, the treatment can be applied to the large class of objects modeled by wires. The nonlinear load types that are considered include those with piecewise-linear voltage-current curves (e.g., one or more diodes), a load with a time varying resistance (which permits modulating the scattered fields), and a general nonlinear load represented by specified voltage-current functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1142982/","volume":"31","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","displayDocTitle":"Time domain modeling of nonlinear loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain modeling of nonlinear loads","sourcePdf":"01142982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028204S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"25632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1142982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1142987,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To first order the sidelobe cancellation is shown to be independent of the actual pattern type and is determined by only two parameters: the number of null constraints\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</tex>\nand the number of sidelobes\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</tex>\nto be cancelled.

The Music algorithm exhibits superior performance at moderate to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction finding with an array of antennas having diverse polarizations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1983.1143038","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25633/01143038.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1983.1143038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1983","displayDocTitle":"Direction finding with an array of antennas having diverse polarizations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction finding with an array of antennas having diverse polarizations","sourcePdf":"01143038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039096S","chronDate":"Mar 1983","isNumber":"25633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"187","articleId":"1143038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143054,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The intermediate frequency range has been analyzed by combinations of these two approaches or by separation of variables, when possible. This paper is devoted to the development of an independent approach, viz., the \"stacked spectral-iteration technique,\" which is capable of handling arbitrary scatterers with dimensions ranging from small to moderately large. The method takes advantage of the simplicity with which the planar-source planar-field relationships are expressed in the spectral domain. The boundary conditions or constitutive relationships, on the other hand, are expressed most simply in the spatial domain. Alternating between the two domains is carried out with the aid of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The spectral-iteration technique (SIT) was applied in the past to thin planar structures which allow the analysis to be carried out on a plane. The generalization of the two-dimensional formulation to arbitrary three-dimensional bodies can be accomplished by sampling the current distribution on the scatterer over a number of parallel planes, and using the simple spectral-domain interaction relationships between the planes. This new approach involves no matrix inversion and is capable of analyzing scatterers whose sizes far exceed those treatable by the moment method. In addition to being arbitrarily shaped, the scatterer may be conducting, dielectric, or lossy dielectric. Thus, the SIT provides an efficient approach to filling the much-needed gap between low- and high-frequency conventional techniques, e.g., the moment method (MoM) and the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), and to extending the range of applicability to dielectric scatterers, with or without loss. Though the concepts presented herein are applicable to arbitrary three-dimensional scatterers, the problem of arbitrary cylinders with\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</tex>\n-polarized excitation is addressed in this paper, while the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</tex>\n-case is treated in an accompanying work.

Within the framework of SEM, efforts have recently been made to show that in a grouping of the resonances along \"layers,\" rather than along the conventional \"arcs\" based on an angular harmonic field representation, the higher order resonances behave collectively like a wave traveling circumferentially around the object. This observation has provided the stimulus for the present investigation in which the relation between the wavefront arrivals (creeping waves) and the SEM resonances is placed on a rigorous basis. Using a perfectly conducting circular cylinder as a canonical model, this is done by direct application of the theory of characteristic Green's functions to construct alternative field solutions, and by collective summation of groups of wavefront arrivals or groups of resonances. The connection between creeping waves and resonances thus having been established, hybrid formulations are developed which combine the creeping waves and the SEM resonances within a single rigorous framework so as to maximize the utility of each over the entire range of observation times. These results are then generalized to smooth cylindrical objects with noncircular convex shape.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1983.1143087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25634","startPage":"426","endPage":"437","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25634/01143087.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Creeping waves and resonances in transient scattering by smooth convex objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1983","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Creeping waves and resonances in transient scattering by smooth convex objects","publicationDate":"May 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Creeping waves and resonances in transient scattering by smooth convex objects","sourcePdf":"01143087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055956S","chronDate":"May 1983","isNumber":"25634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"64","articleId":"1143087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143099,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They are compared with earlier solutions based on a combination of perturbation theory which accounts for Bragg scattering, and physical optics which accounts for specular point theory. The full wave solutions which account for both Bragg scattering and specular point scattering in a self-consistent manner are expressed as a weighted sum of two cross sections. The first is associated with a filtered surface, consisting of the larger scale spectral components, and the second is associated with the surface consisting of the smaller scale spectral components. The specification of the surface wavenumber that separates the surface with the larger spectral components from the surface with the smaller spectral components is dealt with in detail. Since the full wave approach is not restricted by the limitations of perturbation theory, it is possible to examine the sensitivity of the computed values for the backscatter cross sections to large variations in the value of the wavenumber where spectral splitting is assumed to occur.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1983.1143129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25636/01143129.pdf","endPage":"709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computations of scattering cross sections for composite surfaces and the specification of the wavenumber where spectral splitting occurs","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1983.1143129","startPage":"698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1983","displayDocTitle":"Computations of scattering cross sections for composite surfaces and the specification of the wavenumber where spectral splitting occurs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143129/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computations of scattering cross sections for composite surfaces and the specification of the wavenumber where spectral splitting occurs","sourcePdf":"01143129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027509S","chronDate":"Sep 1983","isNumber":"25636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1143129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143132,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Various methods have been given in the literature for randomizing the phase errors to reduce these problems. Here a general formula is derived to evaluate the parasitic sidelobe level for different methods. The various methods are compared with reference to 1) the parasitic sidelobe level, 2) the variances of the field pattern and the pointing direction, 3) gain reduction, and 4) any extra array hardware requirements and beamsteering unit resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25637/01143152.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1983.1143152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1983.1143152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of methods for randomizing phase quantization errors in phased arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Quantization","Phase shifters","Hardware","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Finite-wordlength effects","Phased arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of methods for randomizing phase quantization errors in phased arrays","volume":"31","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of methods for randomizing phase quantization errors in phased arrays","sourcePdf":"01143152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021885S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"25637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1143152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143162,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity, and for many geometries yields accurate results. However, since it neglects the shape and composition of the diffracting surface, it can in some cases yield results which are in serious disagreement with measurements. To remedy this, attempts have been made to approximate the diffracting hill or ridge by other shapes, most notably cylinders. These approaches have not been widely adopted, due in large part to their greater numerical complexity. In this paper it is proposed to apply wedge diffraction in the format of the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), modified to include finite conductivity and local surface roughness effects. It is shown that, for geometries with grazing incidence and/or diffraction angles, significant improvement in accuracy is obtained. Further, the GTD wedge diffraction form used is based on the Fresnel integral, so that it is only slightly more complex numerically than knife edge diffraction. Finally, the GTD includes reflections from the sides of the ridge (wedge faces), and can be extended to multiple ridge diffraction and three-dimensional terrain variations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"70","endPage":"76","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1984.1143189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1984.1143189","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25638/01143189.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite conductivity uniform GTD versus knife edge diffraction in prediction of propagation path loss","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1984","displayDocTitle":"Finite conductivity uniform GTD versus knife edge diffraction in prediction of propagation path loss","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1984","volume":"32","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite conductivity uniform GTD versus knife edge diffraction in prediction of propagation path loss","sourcePdf":"01143189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02731S","chronDate":"Jan 1984","isNumber":"25638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"312","articleId":"1143189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143193,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A volume integral equation is formulated and solved by using the method of moments. Tetrahedral volume elements are used to model a scattering body in which the electrical parameters are assumed constant in each tetrahedron. Special basis functions are defined within the tetrahedral volume elements to insure that the normal electric field satisfies the correct jump condition at interfaces between different dielectric media. An approximate Galerkin testing procedure is used, with special care taken to correctly treat the derivatives in the scalar potential term. Calculated internal field distributions and scattering cross sections of dielectric spheres and rods are compared to and found in agreement with other calculations. The accuracy of the fields calculated by using the tetrahedral cell method is found to be comparable to that of cubical cell methods presently used for modeling arbitrarily shaped bodies, while the modeling flexibility is considerably greater.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1984.1143193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25638/01143193.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1984.1143193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tetrahedral modeling method for electromagnetic scattering by arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneous dielectric bodies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143193/","displayDocTitle":"A tetrahedral modeling method for electromagnetic scattering by arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneous dielectric bodies","volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tetrahedral modeling method for electromagnetic scattering by arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneous dielectric bodies","sourcePdf":"01143193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047578S","chronDate":"Jan 1984","isNumber":"25638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"664","articleId":"1143193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143200,"authors":[{"name":"Jen Jao","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Jen Jao","id":"37353968200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"1143200","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":148,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":777},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar scattering","Rayleigh scattering","Scattering parameters","Radar clutter","Weibull distribution","Rician channels","Probability distribution","Spatial resolution","Background noise","Airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Radar terrain factors"]}],"abstract":"A novel class of probability distributions resulting from a compound Poisson process is found to correlate well with amplitude distributions of radar clutter returns spatially sampled from composite terrain.

The system uses a computer controlled microwave frequency synthesizer and a multichannel computer controlled receiver. The target support/positioning system and an optical target alignment system are also interfaced to the computer. The parameters of the system are 1) operation from 1 to 30 GHz (eventual operation to 96 GHz has been confirmed by field probing); 2) a plane wave volume (test area volume) of 1.3 m diameter; and 3) a sensitivity of -50 dBsm. Of particular importance is the ability of the system to measure phase as well as amplitude. This permits vector subtraction of the background and system calibration using a reference (sphere) target. The development of this system and the performance characteristics obtained so far will be discussed. Some results which demonstrate the system performance will be shown. Of particular interest is the broad-band measurement of both amplitude and phase. This permits conversion of the results to the time domain. Examples will be shown in which the various system components (antennas, reflector, walls, ceiling, etc.) are separated in the time domain by this technique. The development of the range is continuing and planned future improvements will also be discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"The ohio state university compact radar cross-section measurement range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ohio state university compact radar cross-section measurement range","sourcePdf":"01143228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041705S","chronDate":"November  1984","isNumber":"25640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1143228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143230,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The resulting field integral is well behaved when the image current is situated in complex space. Unlike previous approximate images, the present theory is valid for any distance, height of the source, frequency, and half-space parameters. It is demonstrated that the present image theory reduces to the well-known dipole image at complex depth for large dielectric parameters of the half-space. Also, the reflection-coefficient method is obtained as a farfield approximation. Calculation of fields through exact image integration is seen to be simple and accurate and require modest computer capacity and time.

With this iterative technique, it is possible to solve electrically large arbitrarily oriented wire structures without storing any matrices as is conventionally done in the method of moments. The basic difference between the proposed method and Galerkin's method, for the same expansion functions, is that for the iterative technique we are solving a least squares problem. Hence, as the order of the approximation is increased, the proposed technique guarantees a monotonic decrease of the least squared error (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\parallel AI - Y\\parallel^{2}</tex>\n), whereas Galerkin's method does not. Even though the method converges for any initial guess, a good one may significantly reduce the time of computation. Also, explicit error formulas are given for the rate of convergence of this method. Hence, any problem can be solved to a prespecified degree of accuracy. It is shown that the method has the advantage of a direct solution as the final solution is obtained in a finite number of steps. The method is also suitable for solving singular operator equations in which case the method monotonically converges to the least squares solution with minimum norm. Numerical results are presented for the thin-wire antennas and are compared with the solution obtained by the method of moments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25644/01143331.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1984.1143331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1984.1143331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering from arbitrarily oriented wire antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gradient methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Wire","Frequency","Propagation losses","Antennas and propagation","Roundoff errors","Iterative methods","Grid computing","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gradient methods","Wire antennas","Wire scatterers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","displayDocTitle":"The application of the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering from arbitrarily oriented wire antennas","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering from arbitrarily oriented wire antennas","sourcePdf":"01143331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023096S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"25644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","articleId":"1143331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143332,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While the analytic properties of the temporal Laplace transform of the surface currents residing on such an object have received a great deal of attention, the properties of the scattered fields have not. It is shown that the representation of the transform of the scattered field must include an exponential entire function except for observation points in the forward-scattered direction. Explicit time domain representations that are counterpart to the Laplace domain representation are constructed and are shown to embody, in the early time, temporal variation besides that of the damped sinusoidal factors intrinsic to the singularity expansion. An important practical consequence of this more complicated time variation arises in connection with the application of the singularity expansion for target classification purposes and is commented upon herein.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A note on the representation of scattered fields as a singularity expansion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A note on the representation of scattered fields as a singularity expansion","sourcePdf":"01143345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050236S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"25645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1143345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143348,"authors":[{"name":"Chich-Hsing Tsao","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA","Ford Aerospace Company, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chich-Hsing Tsao","id":"37086983533"},{"name":"R.

Placing a null in the sum does not automatically place a null in the difference pattern and vice versa.

However, this requires two sets of adaptive hardware for one antenna. A technique for simultaneous hulling in the sum and difference channels of a monopulse phased array using one set of adaptive weights shared by both channels is described. First, the technique is described for amplitude and phase nulling, then for phase only hulling.

In the power transmission using microwave such as solar power satellite, not only the transmission efficiency, but also the transmitting power capacity allowed by the necessary electromagnetic environment is a very important factor for realization. In this paper the circular antenna aperture illumination is optimized in order to give the maximum transmission efficiency with the constraint on the radiation levels at the edge of the receiving aperture and at the radiation peaks of the subsequent sidelobes. This constrained optimization problem is solved by successive use of the sequential unconstrained minimization techniques (SUMT method). The maximum transmission efficiency and receivable average power density are obtained for various constrained levels of the spilled radiation, and are compared with the values in the unconstrained case.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Power transmission","Aperture antennas","Transmitting antennas","Constraint optimization","Solar energy","Satellite broadcasting","Electromagnetic radiation","Receiving antennas","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Aperture antennas","Microwave power transmission","Solar power satellites"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1984.1143372","startPage":"628","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25646/01143372.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1984.1143372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of aperture illumination for radio wave power transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1984","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of aperture illumination for radio wave power transmission","publicationDate":"June 1984","volume":"32","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of aperture illumination for radio wave power transmission","sourcePdf":"01143372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026969S","chronDate":"Jun 1984","isNumber":"25646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1143372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1143375,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The pattern is formed by control of the reactive loads. Experimental results and the theory are presented for a RESAA consisting of five microstrip rectangular patch elements resonant at 4.0 GHz. Using steepest descent control of the reactive loads in a power inversion mode (no reference), we find that a null with a depth of 30 dB (relative to the pattern maximum) and an angular width of about\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">25\\deg</tex>\ncan be steered towards an interferer. Typically, about 40 steps (iterations) are needed for forming the null. With the slow power meter and general purpose minicomputer that served as the controller, adaptation times of several seconds are required; extrapolation to a dedicated microprocessor controller predicts adaptation times of several milliseconds. Operation in a mode using a reference signal demonstrates that the pattern can be shaped to steer a null toward interference and a lobe towards a desired signal. The nulling bandwidth is approximately 40 MHz with this array. The advantages of a RESAA, as compared With a conventional adaptive array, include the elimination of the mixers and other hardware needed to perform the complex weighting of the output of each element at an intermediate frequency, and better pattern control for closely spaced elements. These advantages are obtained at the expense of a more complicated control algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Reactively steered adaptive array using microstrip patch elements at 4 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactively steered adaptive array using microstrip patch elements at 4 GHz","sourcePdf":"01143420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026247S","chronDate":"August  1984","isNumber":"25648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1143420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143422,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Progressing waves describe the field in terms of direct and multiple reflected-diffracted wavefront or ray arrivals, while oscillatory waves describe the field in terms of body resonances and (or) guided modes. Each description is convenient and physically incisive when it requires few constituent elements but inconvenient and physically more obscure when it requires many elements. Collective summation of many inconvenient elements into fewer convenient ones, when possible, provides a means of switching from a poorly to a more rapidly convergent field representation. Rays (wavefronts) and modes (resonances) fall into the category of such bilaterally convertible wave fields. They not only have complementary convergence properties but furnish, respectively, local and global environmental discriminants. When combined in self-consistent hybrid form, where the number retained of the one uniquely determines the grouping required of the other, there emerges a rigorous theory of propagation and diffraction with high versatility. Groupings can be chosen so as to eliminate \"difficult\" elements (for example, caustic forming or transitional ray fields) and replace these by \"well behaved\" ones (modes) of the complementary species, or to model multiple interference in the one as simple interference in the other. The theory, based on Poisson summation or on alternative treatment of wave spectral representations, is presented and applied to numerous coordinate separable, but also weakly nonseparable, environments in electromagnetics, underwater acoustics and elastic motion, with numerical comparisons to highlight the salient features of the hybrid appraoch.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1984.1143429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25648","startPage":"775","endPage":"796","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25648/01143429.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressing and oscillatory waves for hybrid synthesis of source excited propagation and diffraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1984","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Progressing and oscillatory waves for hybrid synthesis of source excited propagation and diffraction","publicationDate":"August 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressing and oscillatory waves for hybrid synthesis of source excited propagation and diffraction","sourcePdf":"01143429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046029S","chronDate":"Aug 1984","isNumber":"25648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"46","articleId":"1143429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143430,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The scatterers can have axial inhomogeneities, formed by dissimilar dielectric materials. The case of conducting bodies with axially discontinuous coatings is also treated. The penetrable regions can be lossy, characterized by complex permeability and permittivity. Boundary conditions are rigorously treated everywhere including the intersection of the various regions. The solutions are expressed in terms of combinations of two special matrices arising from the Galerkin technique.

The \"element-by-element\" method is useful for small to moderate size arrays. The \"infinite periodic structure\" method deals with one cell of infinite periodic structures, including all the mutual coupling effects. It cannot, however, include edge effects, current tapers, and nonuniform spacings. A new technique called the \"finite periodic structure\" method, is presented and applied to represent the active impedance of an array, it involves two operations. The first is to convert the discrete array problem into a series of continuous aperture problems by the use of Poisson's sum formula. The second is to use spatial Fourier transforms to represent the impedance in a form similar to the infinite periodic structure approach. The active impedance is then given by a convolution integral involving the infinite periodic structure solution and the Fourier transform of the equivalent aperture distribution of the current over the entire area of the array. The formulation is particularly useful for large finite arrays, and edge effects, current tapers, and nonuniform spacings can also be included in the general formulation. Although the general formulation is valid for both the free and forced modes of excitation, the forced excitation problem is discussed to illustrate the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","volume":"33","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite periodic structure approach to large scanning array problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite periodic structure approach to large scanning array problems","sourcePdf":"01143507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065762S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"25652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1143507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143509,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The critical need to know resonant length versus slot offset is emphasized and the desirability of determining this information theoretically rather than experimentally is argued. Then method of moments solutions are used to calculate resonant length versus slot offset for given waveguide dimensions and frequency. These theoretical results are compared to new, carefully obtained experimental data. Agreement is found to be so good, it is concluded that one can dispense with the costly gathering of experimental input data when designing longitudinal slot arrays fed by standard rectangular waveguide.

Microwave holography techniques are finding considerable applications as viable tools for performing this task. In these techniques, the complex (amplitude and phase) far-field pattern of the antenna is measured, using a reference antenna. Then, the Fourier transform relationship, which exists between the far field and a function related to the induced current, is invoked to result in the identification of the surface distortions. To critically examine the accuracy of the constructed surface profiles, simulation studies are required to incorporate both the effects of systematic and random distortions, particularly the effects of the displaced surface panels. In this paper, different simulation models are investigated with emphasis given to a model based on the vector diffraction analysis of a curved reflector with displaced panels. The simulated far-field patterns are then used to reconstruct the location and amount of displacement of the surface panels by employing a fast Fourier transform (FFT)/iterative procedure. The sensitivity of the microwave holography technique based on the number of far-field sampled points, level of distortions, polarizations, illumination tapers, etc., is also examined. In addition, the relationships between Az-El and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">u-v</tex>\nspaces are addressed in the Appendix.

We report on an investigation of single elements of such antennas, including slots which are exponentially tapered (Vivaldi), linearly tapered (LTSA) and constant width (CWSA). For antennas of all types, a good general agreement is obtained for curves of beamwidth versus length, normalized to wavelength, when one compares the data with that for traveling-wave antennas published by Zucker. An important condition for this agreement is that the effective dielectric thickness, defined in the text, is in a certain optimum range. This condition is qualitatively explained in terms of the theory for traveling-wave antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25653/01143542.pdf","startPage":"1392","endPage":"1400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1985.1143542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1985.1143542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Endfire tapered slot antennas on dielectric substrates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Dielectric substrates","Satellite antennas","Dipole antennas","Circuits","Phased arrays","Antenna feeds","Radio astronomy","Planar arrays","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dielectric antennas","Endfire antennas","Traveling wave antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1985","displayDocTitle":"Endfire tapered slot antennas on dielectric substrates","volume":"33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Endfire tapered slot antennas on dielectric substrates","sourcePdf":"01143542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034285S","chronDate":"Dec 1985","isNumber":"25653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"291","articleId":"1143542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1143561,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The series of these global wave fields, which encompass the scattering object as a whole, is slowly convergent at early observation times and even deficient at very early times when portions of the object are as yet unexcited. Thus, the resonance series representation must generally be augmented by an entire function in the complex frequency domain. The choice of the entire function is relatively arbitrary but affects the excitation coefficients, called coupling coefficients, of individual resonances and also the \"turn-on\" and \"switch-on\" times of the SEM series. Moreover, it contains essential (intrinsic) and nonessential (removable) portions which have been subjected to various interpretations. By formulating the transient problem in terms of traveling (progressing) incident, reflected and diffracted wavefronts, these constructs in the SEM can be interpreted in a precise and physical manner. Furthermore, the analysis clarifies the evolution of resonances as collective summations of multiple wavefront fields which are caused by successive reflections or diffractions at the surfaces and scattering centers comprising the object. By combining wavefronts and resonances self-consistently, one may construct a hybrid field that avoids the difficulties at early times in the SEM formulation. The systematic exploration of the interplay between wavefronts and resonances is facilitated through use of a flow diagram, as introduced in system theory. These concepts are developed in broad generality and are illustrated for two-dimensional scattering by various special configurations.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1985.1143669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25659/01143669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1985.1143669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25659","startPage":"706","endPage":"718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavefront interpretation of the singularity expansion method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A wavefront interpretation of the singularity expansion method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavefront interpretation of the singularity expansion method","sourcePdf":"01143669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077021S","chronDate":"Jul 1985","isNumber":"25659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"60","articleId":"1143669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143670,"authors":[{"name":"Qiu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Qiu Zhang","id":"37087626831"},{"name":"Y.

The present international maritime satellite communication system (INMARSAT) has also been studied for the next generation to extend services for small ships, for which the present ship terminals including the antenna systems are too large and too heavy. By using a low-gain antenna, however, multipath fading caused by sea reflections will become a serious problem in designing the new system. To take effective countermeasures to the fading effect, it is very important to get a better knowledge of the fading phenomena caused by sea reflections. From a standpoint of maritime satellite communications, experiments measuring the amount of fading were performed under various sea conditions and in two frequency bands. The wave height, which is considered the most important experimental parameter, was measured objectively by a wave rider buoy. The experimental results show that the amount of fading depends on a wave height and radio frequency and, as the most interesting result, as a wave increases above a certain level, the amount of fading decreases. These results are also discussed theoretically.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25660/01143680.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1985.1143680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1985.1143680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of sea reflection fading in maritime satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflection","Fading","Satellite communication","Satellite antennas","Marine vehicles","Sea measurements","Satellite broadcasting","Mobile antennas","Reflector antennas","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Marine-vehicle communication","Radio propagation terrain factors","Satellite communication, earth terminals","Satellite communication, propagation","Sea surface electromagnetic scattering","UHF radio propagation terrain factors","VHF radio propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of sea reflection fading in maritime satellite communications","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of sea reflection fading in maritime satellite communications","sourcePdf":"01143680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033289S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"25660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1143680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1143682,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Unfortunately, this simple technique also generates unwanted grating lobes. Placing the exact amplitude taper at the element outputs produces the desired far-field pattern, but the feed architecture is complicated and expensive. An alternative to these two techniques is described. A trade-off exists between sidelobe performance and simplicity of design. This trade-off consists of amplitude tapering the subarray outputs and the element outputs in such a way that the element amplitude tapers are identical for every subarray. In this way, the amplitude taper approximates the desired taper much better than subarray tapering alone, yet all the subarrays are identical. Thus, the feed design remains very simple.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1985.1143682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25660","startPage":"846","endPage":"850","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25660/01143682.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing grating lobes due to subarray amplitude tapering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reducing grating lobes due to subarray amplitude tapering","publicationDate":"August 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing grating lobes due to subarray amplitude tapering","sourcePdf":"01143682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022435S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"25660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","articleId":"1143682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143687,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Arbitrary uniform isotropic impedance boundary conditions may be imposed on the faces of the wedge, and both the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) cases are considered. This solution is formulated in terms of a diffraction coefficient which has the same structure as that of the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) for a perfectly conducting wedge. Its extension to the present case is achieved by introducing suitable multiplying factors, which have been derived from an asymptotic evaluation of the exact solution given by Maliuzhinets. When the field point is located on the surface near the edge, a more accurate asymptotic evaluation is employed to obtain a high-frequency expression for the diffracted field, which is suitable for several specific applications. The formulation described in this paper may provide a useful, rigorous basis to search for a more numerically efficient but yet accurate approximation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A uniform GTD formulation for the diffraction by a wedge with impedance faces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A uniform GTD formulation for the diffraction by a wedge with impedance faces","sourcePdf":"01143687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036047S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"25660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"106","articleId":"1143687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143689,"authors":[{"name":"P.-S.

The optimum efficiency is shown to be achieved with relatively simple feeds for a broad class of desired beam shapes.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1985.1143705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25661/01143705.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1985.1143705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum low sidelobe high crossover multiple beam antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143705/","displayDocTitle":"Optimum low sidelobe high crossover multiple beam antennas","volume":"33","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum low sidelobe high crossover multiple beam antennas","sourcePdf":"01143705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03404S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"25661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1143705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143709,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This cross-polarization coupling improves the signal quality on portable radio links by mitigating the effects of random antenna orientation and by providing an additional signal path for diversity combining. Measurements were made of cross-polarization coupling at 800 MHz within and around eight suburban houses and within two commercial buildings. Nearly complete coupling between polarization was seen for all propagation paths except for a few residential paths having high co-polarized signal levels. Because of the high cross-polarization coupling, random orientation of portable radio sets will not cause significant degradation of signal quality.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25662/01143714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25662","startPage":"83","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-polarization coupling measured for 800 MHz radio transmission in and around houses and large buildings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-polarization coupling measured for 800 MHz radio transmission in and around houses and large buildings","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-polarization coupling measured for 800 MHz radio transmission in and around houses and large buildings","sourcePdf":"01143714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032499S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"25662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1143714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143721,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In the modified algorithm, the covariance matrix is redefined such that the effect of thermal noise on the weights of adaptive arrays is reduced.

The measurements were conducted during the winters of 1982 and 1983. The following parametric ranges were covered: 1) liquid water content, 0 to 12.3 percent by volume; 2) snow density, 0.09 to 0.42 g cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n; 3) temperature, 0 to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5 \\deg</tex>\nC and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-15\\deg</tex>\nC (scattering-loss measurements); and 4) crystal size, 0.5 to 1.5 mm. The experimental data indicate that the dielectric behavior of wet snow closely follows the dispersion behavior of water. For dry snow, volume scattering is the dominant loss mechanism at 37 GHz. The applicability of several empirical and theoretical mixing models was evaluated using the experimental data. Both the Debye-like semi-empirical model and the theoretical Polder-Van Santen mixing model were found to describe adequately the dielectric behavior of wet snow. However, the Polder-Van Santen model provided a good fit to the measured values of the real and imaginary parts of wet snow only when the shapes of the water inclusions in snow were assumed to be both nonsymmetrical and dependent upon snow water content. The shape variation predicted by the model is consistent with the variation suggested by the physical mechanisms governing the distribution of liquid water in wet snow.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric properties of snow in the 3 to 37 GHz range","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25664/01143757.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1986","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric properties of snow in the 3 to 37 GHz range","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric properties of snow in the 3 to 37 GHz range","sourcePdf":"01143757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04745S","chronDate":"November  1986","isNumber":"25664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"240","articleId":"1143757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1143771,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For a given array size, the total number of jammers that can be nulled is doubled if complex weights are used instead of real weights. However, the amplitude-only technique has many attractions. It is shown that because the resulting current amplitude distribution has a double symmetry, the number of attenuators required for simultaneous nulling can be as low as a quarter of the total number of elements in the array. This means a much faster computing speed as well as a considerable saving in hardware. The method also allows the main beam of the antenna to be scanned by using phase-shifters while nulls are placed in directions of known jammers in both the sum and difference patterns by using attenuators. As a result, the maximization of the signal-to-jammer ratio can be achieved with relative ease, because the stronger a jammer is, the easier it is to locate it and hence to suppress it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1986","volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous nulling in sum and difference patterns by amplitude control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous nulling in sum and difference patterns by amplitude control","sourcePdf":"01143793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091832S","chronDate":"Feb 1986","isNumber":"25666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1143793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143811,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Their value lies in the considerable amount of additional useful information which they can provide about the interference environment, utilizing a relatively small number of degrees of freedom (DOF). The \"superresolution\" capabilities, estimation of coherence, and relative power level determination serve to complement and refine the data from faster conventional estimation techniques. Two conceptual application area examples for using such techniques are discussed; partially adaptive low-sidelobe arrays, and fully adaptive tracking arrays. For the partially adaptive area the information is utilized for efficient assignment of a limited number of DOF in a beamspace constrained adaptive system in order to obtain a stable main beam, retention of low sidelobes, considerably faster response, and reduction in overall cost. These benefits are demonstrated via simulation examples computed for a 16-element linear array. For the fully adaptive tracking array area the information is utilized in an all-digital processing system concept to permit stable hulling of coherent interference sources in the main beam region, efficient assignment/control of the available DOF, and greater flexibility in time-domain adaptive filtering strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using spectral estimation techniques in adaptive processing antenna systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143827","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25667/01143827.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1986","displayDocTitle":"Using spectral estimation techniques in adaptive processing antenna systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using spectral estimation techniques in adaptive processing antenna systems","sourcePdf":"01143827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031087S","chronDate":"Mar 1986","isNumber":"25667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"136","articleId":"1143827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1143828,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Cases of both fixed and varying angle of arrival are investigated, The former arises with distant sources and will, with a sufficiently long estimation interval, emulate uncorrelated sources and given correspondingly sharp spectra. The latter arises with nearby sources and will allow them to be distinguished but will be attended by spectral shift and broadening, and loss of resolution.

A generalized sidelobe-cancelling structure is employed in which a nonadaptive (conventional) beamformer operates in parallel with an adaptive beamformer.

Blocking is employed to ensure that all incident waveforms which meet the specified constraints do not reach the tapped-delay lines. As a result, an unconstrained least mean square (LMS) power minimization algorithm is employed to adapt the delay line weights.

The set of linear constraints is used to ensure that a desired look-direction response of the processor over a frequency band of interest can be closely approximated. The design technique is posed in such a way that three types of presteering can be handled: no presteering, coarse presteering, and exact presteering. The elimination of presteering time delays or the possibility to use coarse presteering is an attractive feature in a digital implementation of antenna array processors.

Included are the important aspect of antenna aperture smoothing with special emphasis on earth-space paths and the equations derived are applicable to system design and remote sensing. A detailed comparison with published experimental results is carried out and the agreement found is good. Two approaches are described in detail: 1) the point receiver classical wave scattering results are modified to include aperture effects, 2) a scalar scattering cross-section approach is combined with the radar equation and the results derived are similar to those of 1). In addition, approach 2) includes the case of rain. Among the results found it is shown that because the scintillation intensity depends on the ratio between the antenna diameter and the diameter of the Fresnel zone in the turbulent region, low elevation paths counteract the tendency to smoothing by large earth station antennas and the scintillations observed remain large. Also pure scattering induced rain scintillations, even in the millimeter region, are in general reduced to an almost negligible level due to aperture smoothing even though for a theoretical point receiver they would be very intense. The time variability of rain attenuation and its polarization dependence as a source of apparent scintillations are also discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25669/01143867.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"657","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering induced microwave scintillations from clear air and rain on earth space paths and the influence of antenna aperture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1986","displayDocTitle":"Scattering induced microwave scintillations from clear air and rain on earth space paths and the influence of antenna aperture","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering induced microwave scintillations from clear air and rain on earth space paths and the influence of antenna aperture","sourcePdf":"01143867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082567S","chronDate":"May 1986","isNumber":"25669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1143867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1143871,"authors":[{"name":"T.

With this combination, the computational time required to solve large scatterer problems is much less than the time required by the ordinary conjugate gradient method and the method of moments. On the other hand, since the spatial derivatives are replaced with simple multiplications in the transformed domain, some of the computational difficulties present in the ordinary conjugate gradient method and the method of moments do not exist here. Therefore, electrically small structures can also be handled more easily. Finally, since the method is iterative, it is possible to know the accuracy in a problem solution. Two types of scatterers are analyzed: wires (both very long and very short) and square plates (very large and small). The details of the computational procedure are presented along with numerical results for some of the scatterers analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25669/01143871.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of FFT and the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic radiation from electrically large and small conducting bodies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gradient methods","Electromagnetic radiation","Conductors","Wire","Electromagnetic scattering","Character generation","Moment methods","Equations","Kernel","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT","Discrete Fourier transforms (DFT's)","Gradient methods","Plates","Wire scatterers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","displayDocTitle":"Application of FFT and the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic radiation from electrically large and small conducting bodies","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of FFT and the conjugate gradient method for the solution of electromagnetic radiation from electrically large and small conducting bodies","sourcePdf":"01143871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02232S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"25669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"261","articleId":"1143871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1143874,"authors":[{"name":"Ruey-Beei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ruey-Beei Wu","id":"38226227100"},{"name":"Chun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun Chen","id":"37351222600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"1143874","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The variational reaction theory is applied to obtain the (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E_{Z}, H_{z}</tex>\n)formulation for the scattering problem when a plane wave is obliquely incident upon an inhomogeneous and anisotropic dielectric cylinder.

The excitation is assumed to be due to a plane wave or infinitesimal electric dipoles located within or outside the dielectric. Several formulation types are considered and used to investigate the scattering by different objects. It is found that for moderate values of the dielectric constant, all formulation types give satisfactory results. However, for small or large relative permittivities the solution accuracies depend on the formulation type. As an application of the method to practical problems, two special cases of dielectric rod and microstrip antennas are considered.

This new method is based on the natural frequencies of the target. It consists of synthesizing aspect-independent discriminant signals, called extinction-pulses (E-pulses) and single-mode extraction signals which, when convolved numerically with the late-time transient response of an expected target, lead to zero or single-mode responses. When the synthesized, discriminant signals for an expected target are convolved with the radar return from a different target, the resulting signal will be significantly different from the expected zero or single-mode responses, thus, the differing targets can be discriminated. Theoretical synthesis of discriminant signals from known target natural frequencies and experimental synthesis of them for a complex target from its measured pulse response are presented. The scheme has been tested with measured responses of various targets in the laboratory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1986","volume":"34","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radar target discrimination by convolution of radar return with extinction-pulses and single-mode extraction signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar target discrimination by convolution of radar return with extinction-pulses and single-mode extraction signals","sourcePdf":"01143908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035182S","chronDate":"Jul 1986","isNumber":"25671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","articleId":"1143908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1143916,"authors":[{"name":"R.

With minimal a priori knowledge of the signal environment, this technique nulls out jammers while simultaneously preserving the quality of the main lobe so that a friendly look-direction signal can be received with unity gain. Unfortunately, in the absence of special strategies, linearly constrained adaptive beamforming is hypersensitive to array imperfections when the input signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold. This hypersensitivity manifests itself as a nailing of the friendly signal as if it were a jammer. Luckily, the signal nulling problem can be easily remedied by artificial receiver noise injection. A particularly simple and general structure for linearly constrained adaptive beamforming was proposed during the 1970's, and is known as the generalized sidelobe canceller. A detailed analysis of the generalized sidelobe canceller in the presence of array imperfections is discussed, and two new artificial receiver noise injection algorithms are proposed. Computer simulations are included to demonstrate that use of these new algorithms alleviates the signal nailing problem without seriously compromising jammer nulling. For the special case of the Capon maximum-likelihood beamformer, simple approximations are presented for: 1) the Wiener output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SINR_{0}\\astr</tex>\n), 2) the antenna element error variance that causes a 3 dB loss of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SINR_{0}\\astr</tex>\nfrom its value for an ideal array, and 3) the optimal artificial receiver noise that maximizes\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SINR_{0}\\astr</tex>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25672/01143936.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming with the generalized sidelobe canceller in the presence of array imperfections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Jamming","Signal to noise ratio","Noise cancellation","Antenna measurements","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer simulation","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Antenna tolerance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1986","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming with the generalized sidelobe canceller in the presence of array imperfections","volume":"34","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming with the generalized sidelobe canceller in the presence of array imperfections","sourcePdf":"01143936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044099S","chronDate":"August  1986","isNumber":"25672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"171","articleId":"1143936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1143947,"authors":[{"name":"R.

With this technique the complexity, weight, and RF loss of the array feed can be significantly reduced, especially in a large array. This uniquely formed array has the capability of generating excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relatively wide frequency bandwidth. In addition, the array is capable of scanning its main beam in the principal planes to relatively wide angles from its broadside direction without serious degradation to its CP quality. Another feature of this uniquely arranged array is a reduction in the occurrence of mutual coupling. The discussion in this paper places special emphasis on the microstrip type of radiator, although the technique presented can be adapted to most types of linearly polarized antenna elements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25673/01143953.pdf","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1986.1143953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1986.1143953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1143953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A technique for an array to generate circular polarization with linearly polarized elements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Phased arrays","Microstrip antennas","Radio frequency","Feeds","Bandwidth","Degradation","Microstrip antenna arrays","Mutual coupling","Adaptive arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Microstrip arrays","Polarizations","Scanning antennas","UHF antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1143953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","displayDocTitle":"A technique for an array to generate circular polarization with linearly polarized elements","volume":"34","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for an array to generate circular polarization with linearly polarized elements","sourcePdf":"01143953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019502S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"25673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"371","articleId":"1143953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1143956,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This formulation, called the on-surface radiation condition (OSRC) approach, is based upon an expansion of the radiation condition applied directly on the surface of a scatterer. Past approaches involved applying a radiation condition at some distance from the scatterer in order to achieve a nearly reflection-free truncation of a finite-difference time-domain lattice. However, it is now shown that application of a suitable radiation condition directly on the surface of a convex conducting scatterer can lead to substantial simplification of the frequency-domain integral equation for the scattered field, which is reduced to just a line integral. For the transverse magnetic (TM) case, the integrand is known explicitly. For the transverse electric (TE) case, the integrand can be easily constructed by solving an ordinary differential equation around the scatterer surface contour. Examples are provided which show that OSRC yields computed near and far fields which approach the exact results for canonical shapes such as the circular cylinder, square cylinder, and strip. Electrical sizes for the examples are\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ka = 5</tex>\nand\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ka = 10</tex>\n.

Structures with edges or corners can also be analyzed, although more work is needed to incorporate the physics of singular currents at these discontinuities. Convex dielectric structures can also be treated using OSRC. These will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1987.1144062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25678/01144062.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1987.1144062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25678","startPage":"153","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new formulation of electromagnetic wave scattering using an on-surface radiation boundary condition approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new formulation of electromagnetic wave scattering using an on-surface radiation boundary condition approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new formulation of electromagnetic wave scattering using an on-surface radiation boundary condition approach","sourcePdf":"01144062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052763S","chronDate":"February  1987","isNumber":"25678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"141","articleId":"1144062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1144065,"authors":[{"name":"A.

There are, however, many circumstances for which it may not be practical to directly utilize uniform sampling techniques. A two-dimensional sampling technique which can employ irregularly (nonuniformly) spaced samples (amplitude and phase) in order to generate the complete far-field patterns is presented. The technique implements a matrix inversion algorithm which depends only on the nonuniform sampled data point locations and with no dependence on the actual field values at these points. A powerful simulation algorithm is presented to allow a real-life simulation of many reflector/feed configurations and to determine the usefulness of the nonuniform sampling technique for the co-polar and cross-polar patterns. Additionally, an overlapped window concept and a generalized error simulation model are discussed to identify the stability of the technique for recovering the field data among the nonuniform sampled data. Numerical results are tailored for the pattern reconstruction of a 20-m offset reflector antenna operating at\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</tex>\n-band.

The results were compared with studies of a much smaller and dissimilar office building. The results were found to be substantially the same, despite the physical differences of the buildings themselves. This may be due to external geographical features. Overall worst-case root mean square (rms) time delay spreads in the buildings were 250 ns and 218 ns in the larger and smaller building, respectively. However, these values improved to under 100 ns when there was a good direct path between the antennas. Time delay spread was also shown to be independent of relative antenna polarizations of the transmitter and receiver, even on line-of-sight paths. Received signal levels were below -90 dB with reference to the level at 0.3 m separation, in the worst cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25679/01144106.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1987.1144106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1987.1144106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25679","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of time delay spread and signal level measurements within two dissimilar office buildings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Level measurement","Radio transmitters","Buildings","Attenuation","Antennas and propagation","Receiving antennas","Digital communication","Bandwidth","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Attenuation measurement","Indoor radio communications","Radio communication, indoor","VHF radio propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of time delay spread and signal level measurements within two dissimilar office buildings","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of time delay spread and signal level measurements within two dissimilar office buildings","sourcePdf":"01144106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034031S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"25679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"73","articleId":"1144106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144112,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Sarkar et al. describe how the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the conjugate gradient method (CGM) can be used to efficiently make use of the convolutional form of the electric field integral equation for straight wire antennas. The commentators agree that the CGM converges more rapidly than the previously used method of steepest descent and the spectral iteration technique. They also point out that experience with the dyadic Green's function encountered in the two-dimensional transverse electric (TE) and three-dimensional equations for dielectric bodies is not so encouraging. It is found that for these cases the CGM convergence can be quite slow, degrading the efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, the solution obtained using the pulse-basis point-matching method to discretize the integral equation are very inaccurate for the two-dimensional TE and three-dimensional cases.

These experiments employed a helicopter as a source platform and a van with receiver and data acquisition instrumentation. Tree attenuation results were obtained for the cases in which the van was stationary and in motion. The experiments were performed for the purpose of providing the designers of planned land mobile satellite systems with important elements in the determination of link parameter requirements; namely, the expected fading statistics due to roadside trees for both mobile and stationary vehicles. Single tree attenuation results gave worst case median fades as high as 15 dB although roadside tree values were noted to produce fades in excess of 20 dB for small percentages of time. The cumulative fade distributions and their relative contributions as a function of path elevation angle, right side versus left side driving, and different road types are derived from the field measurements. Upon comparing the attenuations from bare deciduous trees (March 1986) with those due to trees in full foliage (October 1985), the increase in dB attenuations were, in general, less than 25 percent for the dynamic cases, and less than 40 percent for the worst case static configuration. This result demonstrates thai the dominant fading is caused by the wooded tree branches as opposed to the leaves on these branches. The tail end of the observed fade distributions was observed to follow lognormal distributions with respect to dB attenuation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roadside tree attenuation measurements at UHF for land mobile satellite systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1987.1144137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25681/01144137.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1987.1144137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1987","displayDocTitle":"Roadside tree attenuation measurements at UHF for land mobile satellite systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roadside tree attenuation measurements at UHF for land mobile satellite systems","sourcePdf":"01144137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031787S","chronDate":"May 1987","isNumber":"25681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1144137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144138,"authors":[{"name":"Hsueh-Jyh Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Hsueh-Jyh Li","id":"37281090100"},{"name":"N.

Accordingly, the concept of optimum polarization must be extended to the case of incoherent scattering where the scattered waves are partially polarized. Here, it will be shown that the Stokes scattering operator is the most suitable characterization of incoherent scattering. The problem of finding the polarization that would yield an optimum amount of power received from the scatterer is solved by assuming a knowledge of the Stokes scattering operator instead of the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2 \\times 2</tex>\nscattering matrix with complex elements.

Antennas Propagat.-1963/1964) developed the solution to the circular symmetric dual shaped synthesis problem, the question of existence (and of uniqueness) for offset dual (or single) shaped synthesis has been a point of controversy. Many researchers thought that the exact offset solutions may not exist. Later, Galindo-Israel and Mittra (IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat.-1979) and others formulated the problem exactly and obtained excellent and numerically efficient but approximate solutions. Using a technique similar to that first developed by Schruben for the single reflector problem (Journal of the Optical Society-1973), Brickell and Westcott (Proc. Institute of Electrical Engineering-1981) developed a Monge-Ampere (MA) second-order nonlinear partial differential equation for the dual reflector problem. They solved an elliptic form of this equation by a technique introduced by Rall (1979) which iterates, by a Newton method, a finite difference linearized MA equation. The elliptic character requires a set of finite difference equations to be developed and solved iteratively. Existence still remained in question. Although the second-order MA equation developed by Schruben is elliptic, the first-order equations from which the MA equation is derived can be integrated progressively (e.g., as for an initial condition problem such as for hyperbolic equations) a noniterative and usually more rapid type solution. In this paper, we have solved, numerically, the first-order equations. Exact solutions are thus obtained by progressive integration. Furthermore, we have concluded that not only does an exact solution exist, but an infinite set of such solutions exists. These conclusions are inferred, in part, from numerical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflector antennas","Antenna theory","Antennas and propagation","Difference equations","Nonlinear equations","Finite difference methods","Optical propagation","Nonlinear optics","Partial differential equations","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nonlinear equations","Offset reflector antennas","Partial differential equations","Reflector antennas, offset"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.1987.1144200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25684/01144200.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1987.1144200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the theory of the synthesis of single and dual offset shaped reflector antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the theory of the synthesis of single and dual offset shaped reflector antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144200/","volume":"35","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of the synthesis of single and dual offset shaped reflector antennas","sourcePdf":"01144200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032096S","chronDate":"Aug 1987","isNumber":"25684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"56","articleId":"1144200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1144210,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It has been found to be superior to the conventional Fourier transform technique in resolution and dynamic range.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1987.1144210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25684","startPage":"986","endPage":"988","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25684/01144210.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1987.1144210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering center analysis via Prony's method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar scattering","Optical scattering","Electromagnetic scattering","Acoustic scattering","Optical reflection","Diffraction","Geometry","Frequency","Physics","Radar cross section"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RCS (radar cross section)","Radar cross sections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1987","displayDocTitle":"Scattering center analysis via Prony's method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"35","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering center analysis via Prony's method","sourcePdf":"01144210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033231S","chronDate":"Aug 1987","isNumber":"25684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"130","articleId":"1144210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1144212,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Melin","affiliation":["Saab Missiles AB, Linkoping, Sweden"],"lastName":"Jan Melin","id":"38180868700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"1144212","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Radar cross sections (RCS) must be measured at large distance.

These are that the phase velocity of the traveling wave be equal to or less than the velocity of light in free space and that the aperture be excited with a strong longitudinal component of electric field. Practical ways of achieving these conditions are mentioned and an approximate analysis based on partially dielectric-filled waveguide theory is used to determine the aperture fields as a function of the antenna geometry. Far-field pattern characteristics are discussed. It is found that the actual pattern may differ considerably from that predicted by simple theory. This is attributed primarily to two things, a finite ground plane and the discontinuity produced by the abrupt aperture opening. Two practical discontinuity minimizers are described. The ground plane effect is analyzed by applying Huygens Principle, and a simple procedure is described for determining the first-order effect. The problem of obtaining pencil-beam radiation in the horizontal (plane of the ground plane) pattern is solved quite simply by using wide-aperture antennas which can be made to operate satisfactorily over better than a 2:1 band. The efficiency and vswr of a practical antenna, with sidelobes in the horizontal pattern at least 20 db down, have been measured over a 2:1 band. The efficiency varied from 65 per cent at the high-frequency end of the band to 55 per cent at the low end. The vswr was less than 1.4 over the band.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1955","publicationDate":"April 1955","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Endfire slot antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Endfire slot antennas","sourcePdf":"01144286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031764S","chronDate":"April  1955","isNumber":"25692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1144286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144323,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Some of the results of a study of the properties of such slots is presented. The study was undertaken with the aim of obtaining information useful in design of a circularly polarized linear array. Some of the properties of the slot pairs are as follows: 1) They are inherently matched, independent of the slot length. 2) When the slot arms are made resonant, approximately 75 per cent of the incident power is radiated, with a vswr of 1.12. 3) When fed from one end of the waveguide, the slots radiate right-hand circular polarization; from the other end, left-hand. In using these slots in linear arrays the power radiated is varied by changing slot length, since position and orientation are fixed by the requirements of circular polarization. The slots must be separated by a guide wavelength, so waveguide loading or other complicated schemes must be used to reduce the slot spacing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25703","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8234/25703/01144463.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1957.1144463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1957.1144463","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly polarized slot radiators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144463/","displayDocTitle":"Circularly polarized slot radiators","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circularly polarized slot radiators","sourcePdf":"01144463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048598S","chronDate":"January  1957","isNumber":"25703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"59","articleId":"1144463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144473,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These techniques have been applied to the construction of pillboxes whose wide-angle scanning properties and improved radiation characteristics substantiate the theory.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1958.1144548","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8234/25709/01144548.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1958.1144548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-angle scanning with microwave double-layer pillboxes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1958","displayDocTitle":"Wide-angle scanning with microwave double-layer pillboxes","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1958","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-angle scanning with microwave double-layer pillboxes","sourcePdf":"01144548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072446S","chronDate":"January  1958","isNumber":"25709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1144548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144549,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The design of the antenna is based upon the simple fundamental principle that if the shape of the antenna were such that it could be specified entirely by angles, its performance would be independent of wavelength. Since all such shapes extend to infinity it is necessary to specify at least one length for an antenna of finite size. The one length in this antenna, the arm length, need only be of the order of one wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation to obtain operation essentially independent of frequency, and the geometry of the antenna allows this arm length to be spiraled into a maximum diameter of one half wavelength or less. Antennas have been constructed that have an essentially constant radiation pattern and input impedance over bandwidths greater than 20 to 1.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25718","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8234/25718/01144653.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1959.1144653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1959.1144653","startPage":"181","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The equiangular spiral antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144653/","displayDocTitle":"The equiangular spiral antenna","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The equiangular spiral antenna","sourcePdf":"01144653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105363S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"25718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"262","articleId":"1144653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1144675,"authors":[{"name":"Tingye Li","affiliation":["Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Tingye Li","id":"38226507100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-1973"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3643"}],"articleNumber":"1144675","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflector antennas","Apertures","Geometrical optics","Feeds","Antennas and propagation","Lighting","Silver","Paints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reflector antennas, spherical","Spherical reflector antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144675","abstract":"A study is made of spherical reflectors for use as wide-angle scanning antennas.

The latter model is useful in explaining certain experimental data on the terrestrial propagation of VLF radio waves.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1959.1144775","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8234/25721/01144775.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1959.1144775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guiding of electromagnetic waves by uniformly rough surfaces: Part II","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1144775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1144775/","displayDocTitle":"Guiding of electromagnetic waves by uniformly rough surfaces: Part II","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"December 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guiding of electromagnetic waves by uniformly rough surfaces: Part II","sourcePdf":"01144775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061402S","chronDate":"December  1959","isNumber":"25721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1144775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1144807,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The radiating elements considered are infinitely long wires spaced on half-wavelength centers and half-wave dipoles spaced on half-wavelength centers, each backed by a conducting ground plane spaced one-quarter wavelength from the elements.

This paper discusses the theory of simultaneous \"scanning\" using time modulation techniques and shows that the required pattern complex is generated by a progressive-pulse aperture excitation.

The dipoles are allowed to take on all the angles within this cone. A vertically-polarized receiver is assumed off on the horizon and the transmitter on the ground below the chaff. The cross section is a function of the conical angle of the configuration and the angle between a normal to the ground and the incident electric field from the transmitter. Fig. 2 is a plot of the scattering cross section as a function of these two angles. Half-wave chaff randomly distributed within a conical angle about a vertical is not the most effective ensemble, but is a practical one at the lower frequencies. Cutting all these half-wave dipoles into very short ones makes it practical to place them in a horizontal position which has an ensemble gain over the conical but a reradiation loss, since short dipoles are less effective scatters than half-wave ones.

These individual signals are combined coherently to form one or more receiving beams for searching, tracking, or performing both functions simultaneously. This paper presents an approach to the theory of angle measurement with a phased array of this type. In the one-dimensional problem considered here, the receiving antenna consists of a linear array of individual antenna-amplifier elements. The receiver-noise-limited case is considered, in which accuracy is limited by the additive normally distributed noise present in each channel. An expression is derived for the limiting accuracy of angular measurement when a single set of samples is available. This set of samples is obtained simultaneously, one sample from each channel. Next, two methods of implementing the angular measurements are discussed. These are amplitude comparison monopulse and a coherent or phase comparison technique. For large signal-to-noise ratios and for either a square law or a linear envelope detector, the accuracy of amplitude comparison monopulse approaches the theoretical limit. The same accuracy can be achieved with the coherent technique by proper weighting of the individual signals.","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8234/25738/01145000.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"275","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1961.1145000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1961.1145000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angular accuracy of a phased array radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1961","displayDocTitle":"Angular accuracy of a phased array radar","publicationDate":"May 1961","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angular accuracy of a phased array radar","sourcePdf":"01145000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034662S","chronDate":"May  1961","isNumber":"25738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1145000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1145013,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Such radiators are called arbitrarily polarized antennas. The apertures described are located on upper plates of radial waveguides and are composed of annular slots, with each annulus consisting of a discrete number of crossed slots. The annular slots are positioned so that each arm of the crossed slots can couple by a constant factor with the radial or circumferential currents flowing over the aperture plate to produce a common instantaneous direction for the electric field in each slot pair Both standing-wave and traveling-wave array types are employed. The standing-wave array requires only one radial waveguide mode for its operation. The traveling-wave array requires two modes and results in greater bandwidth and greater freedom in arraying many annuli.

A theory for the resistively-loaded dipole antenna is formulated on the basis that the inserted resistors (one in each arm) can be replaced by equivalent generators and that the resulting triply-driven antenna can be solved by the superposition of singly- and doubly-driven dipoles. Approximately 50 per cent of the power is dissipated in these resistors. With a traveling-wave distribution of current on an antenna available, the properties of this antenna are then investigated and compared with those of the conventional linear antenna. It is found that the input impedance of the traveling-wave antenna remains essentially constant as a function of antenna length, whereas that of the conventional linear antenna varies considerably. It is also shown that the input impedance of the traveling-wave antenna varies only slightly over a 2 to 1 frequency band. The directional properties of the traveling-wave and conventional dipole are compared, and it is shown that a minor lobe does not appear in the radiation pattern of the traveling-wave dipole until it is much longer than the conventional dipole. Also, it is shown that where the directional properties of the conventional dipole are quite sensitive to a change in frequency, those of the traveling-wave dipole are not.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1961","publicationDate":"July 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The traveling-wave linear antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The traveling-wave linear antenna","sourcePdf":"01145026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063888S","chronDate":"July  1961","isNumber":"25739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"73","articleId":"1145026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1145039,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For the amplitude-comparison type of monopulse having an antenna whose main aperture is illuminated by a feed, these independent requirements can be met by a feed designed to fulfill two conditions. One is that excitation of the feed aperture in the difference modes be effectively about twice as wide as in the sum mode. The other is that the shapes of all the feed excitations be free of any avoidable irregularities. The amount of improvement available when these conditions are met depends on the optimization point desired for each mode, as well as the design of the reference antenna. In a typical case, the gains and slopes in the difference modes should increase by several db. Furthermore, the near sidelobes and the spillover radiation in the difference modes should decrease by an order of magnitude. A small increase of gain in the sum mode is also available, and finally, the criticalness of positioning the feed may be appreciably reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1961","publicationDate":"September 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"9","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum feeds for all three modes of a monopulse antenna I: Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum feeds for all three modes of a monopulse antenna I: Theory","sourcePdf":"01145039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036033S","chronDate":"September  1961","isNumber":"25740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8234","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1145039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145048,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Previous variational formulations of analogous waveguide problems were largely restricted to cases in which only the dominant mode can propagate. In applying these methods to scattering problems, the ratio of aperture spacing to wavelength had to be restricted to less than unity at normal incidence so that no additional propagating modes were excited. The formulation presented here can be applied, however, for any number of propagating modes.

Simple signal processing is shown to be sufficient to extract the propagation angles of the \"trapped\" (i.e., propagating) modes of the acoustic waveguide.

Using a nonlinear vehicle simulation, the relationship between model uncertainty and performance is examined. The results show that adequate controllers can be designed using simple nonlinear models, but that performance improves as model uncertainty is decreased and the improvements can be predicted quantitatively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25744/01145131.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1985.1145131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1985.1145131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust trajectory control of underwater vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Underwater vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Sliding mode control","Uncertainty","Aerodynamics","Predictive models","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Hydrodynamics","Remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Robots, locomotion","Robustness, nonlinear systems","Underwater vehicle control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1985","displayDocTitle":"Robust trajectory control of underwater vehicles","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust trajectory control of underwater vehicles","sourcePdf":"01145131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025361S","chronDate":"Oct 1985","isNumber":"25744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"339","articleId":"1145131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145138,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuck Kwon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Hyuck Kwon","id":"37274499000"},{"name":"T.

Ships have been detected at ranges of 2000 km or more by OTHR that uses sufficient resolution in the radar spatial and Doppler frequency domains. The HF sea-echo Doppler spectrum limits the target signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), as a function of the ocean wave-height distribution, wind direction, radio frequency, and ship target radial velocity. Maximum sea-clutter spectrum purity, and hence larger SCR, is achieved with the use of stable single-mode ionospheric propagation. Real-time measurement and interpretation of ionospheric propagation features therefore must guide the choice of OTHR operating frequency. Experimental data recorded at the ONR/SR1 Wide Aperture Research Facility (WARF) bistatic OTHR in central California demonstrate reliable ship detection in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. WARF transmits 1-MW average effective radiated power, using a linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) waveform, and receives with a 2.55-km broadside array of vertical monopole element pairs. Swept bandwidths as high as 200 kHz have been used. Sufficient spectral resolution is achieved with a coherent integration time (CIT) of 12.8 s. Longer CIT, and autoregressive (AR) spectral analysis techniques such as Marple's algorithm, have been used to improve Doppler resolution.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1986.1145176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25746/01145176.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1986.1145176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"196","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ship detection with high-resolution HF skywave radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1986","displayDocTitle":"Ship detection with high-resolution HF skywave radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145176/","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ship detection with high-resolution HF skywave radar","sourcePdf":"01145176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049375S","chronDate":"Apr 1986","isNumber":"25746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"68","articleId":"1145176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1145203,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The component parts of such a robotic system are first discussed, followed by a description of the information and processing subsystems that are, therefore, required. The framework within which they are implemented uses the architecture of a blackboard system to specify a modular unit (the blackboard cell) capable of manipulating the diverse types of process and uncertain information encountered. In this respect, the cell represents a departure from previously reported blackboard implementations. Interconnection of these modular units uses a standard interface, configured as a globally accessible blackboard. As a means of evaluation, a software implementation of the architecture is applied to the sonar perception subsystem. The image processing tools at the heart of a simple knowledge base are described, and results are presented to show a small sequence of system execution, and some examples of candidate object and shadow areas derived from real sonar images. It is demonstrated that the blackboard cell allows a rich feedback structure to the flow of information and processes, allowing both model and data-driven actions to support the formation of competitive and cooperative solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25747/01145203.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1986.1145203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1986.1145203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A knowledge-based system framework for environmental perception in a subsea robotics context","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge based systems","Remotely operated vehicles","Sonar applications","Navigation","Robot sensing systems","Intelligent vehicles","Control systems","Automotive engineering","Automatic control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Expert systems","Sea floor","Sonar detection","Underwater vehicle control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1986","displayDocTitle":"A knowledge-based system framework for environmental perception in a subsea robotics context","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A knowledge-based system framework for environmental perception in a subsea robotics context","sourcePdf":"01145203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036734S","chronDate":"Jul 1986","isNumber":"25747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1145203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145216,"authors":[{"name":"B.

For nonparametric detection of narrow-band signals the natural extension of the zero medians assumption is the zero marginal medians assumption on the in-phase and quadrature noise components. Nonparametric detectors operating under this assumption are developed here for narrow-baud signals; these can be taken to be the logical counterparts of the low-pass sign correlator and polarity coincidence correlator detectors of low-pass theory. The concept of conditional testing, which has been applied previously to obtain efficient multilevel versions of low-pass sign detection schemes, is shown to enter quite naturally in the definition of narrow-band counterparts of the sign correlator and the polarity coincidence correlator detectors. It is also shown that under the diagonal symmetry extension of the low-pass univariate symmetry condition on the noise probability density function, multilevel extensions of these conditional test narrow-hand detectors may also be defined as counterparts of the multilevel conditional test schemes for low-pass signals.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1987.1145221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25749/01145221.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1987.1145221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Hard Limiting and Sign Detection of Narrow-Band Deterministic and Random Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145221/","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Hard Limiting and Sign Detection of Narrow-Band Deterministic and Random Signals","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Hard Limiting and Sign Detection of Narrow-Band Deterministic and Random Signals","sourcePdf":"01145221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051891S","chronDate":"Jan 1987","isNumber":"25749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1145221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145222,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Principal attention is given to the formal structuring of the scattered and ambient acoustic noise fields, as well as that of the desired signal, including both fading and Doppler \"smear\" phenomena. The role of general receiving arrays is noted, as well as their impact on spatial and temporal signal processing and beam forming, as indicated by various performance measures in detection and estimation. The emphasis here is on limiting optimum threshold systems, with some attention to suboptimum cases. Specific first-order probability density functions (pdf's) for the non-Ganssian components of typical underwater acoustic noise environments are included along with their field covariances. Several examples incorporating these pdf's are given, to illustrate the applications and general methods involved. The fundamental role of the detector structure in determining the associated optimum estimators is noted: the estimators arc specific linear or nonlinear functionals of the original optimum detector algorithm, depending on the criterion (i.e., minimization of the chosen error or cost function) selected. Results for both coherent and incoherent modes of reception are presented, reflecting the fact that frequently signal epoch is not known initially at the receiver. To supplement the general discussion, a selected list of references is included, to provide direct access to specific detailed problems, techniques, and results, for which the present paper is only a guide.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1987.1145225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25749/01145225.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1987.1145225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Modeling and Threshold Signal Processing in Underwater Acoustics: An Analytical Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145225/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Modeling and Threshold Signal Processing in Underwater Acoustics: An Analytical Overview","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Modeling and Threshold Signal Processing in Underwater Acoustics: An Analytical Overview","sourcePdf":"01145225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041306S","chronDate":"Jan 1987","isNumber":"25749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"70","articleId":"1145225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145231,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The model assumes that i) the narrow-band signals are transmitted through a Rayleigh channel, ii) the observing array is geometrically linear, and iii) the source motion is deterministic. Ranging techniques based on synchronized measurements of the travel time delay are precluded by the incoherent phase model considered. The paper explores alternative methods that process the phase modulations induced on the signal by the extended geometry and relative dynamics. The present work applies maximum likelihood theory to design the receiver, being concerned with the global identifiability of all parameters defining the relative source/receiver geometry and dynamics. The emphasis is placed on the passive range global acquisition. In contradistinction with the previous papers, where the time stationarity (Part I) or the space homogeneity (Part II) lead to a one-dimensional processor, here the receiver involves processing over both domains. The paper considers the issues of space/time factorability and coupling arising in nonhomogeneous passive tracking. The cross coupling, resulting in more complex filters, improves the receiver acquisition capability. Resorting to Taylor's series type studies, the paper quantifies these improvements, as well as the receiver's mean square error performance, in terms of intuitively satisfying analytical expressions.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1979.1145425","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25765/01145425.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1979.1145425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive systems theory with narrow-band and linear constraints: Part III - Spatial/Temporal diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1979","displayDocTitle":"Passive systems theory with narrow-band and linear constraints: Part III - Spatial/Temporal diversity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145425/","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive systems theory with narrow-band and linear constraints: Part III - Spatial/Temporal diversity","sourcePdf":"01145425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037553S","chronDate":"July  1979","isNumber":"25765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1145425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1145448,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The small submersibles may be employed for underwater mining, exploration, bottom mapping, or military surveillance. Modulation and coding design is presented; the techniques discussed provide multiple protection against multipath and fading, high reliability, acceptable transmitted signal total time duration, simplicity, and economy. The required decision point signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for Rayleigh fading conditions is derived for the modulation and coding design. Particular attention is paid in the receive signal processing to the Doppler (relative velocity) and Doppler variation (relative acceleration) problems inherent in a scenario with mobile endpoints. A Figure-of-Merit (FOM) calculation is provided for typical geometrical and environmental parameters. It is shown for a realistic source level that the required SNR can be achieved at long range with considerable endpoint relative motion.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1980.1145465","startPage":"199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25769/01145465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1980.1145465","endPage":"204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple terminal acoustic communications system design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1980","displayDocTitle":"Multiple terminal acoustic communications system design","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple terminal acoustic communications system design","sourcePdf":"01145465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019268S","chronDate":"Jul 1980","isNumber":"25769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1145465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145478,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The frequency-domain beamformer operates in the frequency domain to form beams and power spectrum data over narrow frequency bands of interest. A real-time digital filtering technique is used to extract the narrow bands of interest from the broad-band input signal. The frequency-domain beamformer accomplishes real-time digital filtering and beamforming by using a high-speed array processor to do the complex calculations and data handling required by the algorithm. The time-domain beamformer operates in parallel with the frequency-domain beamformer to form up to 16 broad-band beams in the time domain.

The probabilistic data association (PDA) method, which is based on computing the posterior probability of each candidate measurement found in a validation gate, assumes that only one real target is present and all other measurements are Poisson-distributed clutter. In this paper, a new theoretical result is presented: the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, in which joint posterior association probabilities are computed for multiple targets (or multiple discrete interfering sources) in Poisson clutter. The algorithm is applied to a passive sonar tracking problem with multiple sensors and targets, in which a target is not fully observable from a single sensor. Targets are modeled with four geographic states, two or more acoustic states, and realistic (i.e., low) probabilities of detection at each sample time. A simulation result is presented for two heavily interfering targets illustrating the dramatic tracking improvements obtained by estimating the targets' states using joint association probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1983.1145560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1983.1145560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25781/01145560.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sonar tracking of multiple targets using joint probabilistic data association","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1983","displayDocTitle":"Sonar tracking of multiple targets using joint probabilistic data association","volume":"8","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145560/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sonar tracking of multiple targets using joint probabilistic data association","sourcePdf":"01145560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098114S","chronDate":"Jul 1983","isNumber":"25781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"776","articleId":"1145560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1145572,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For signals which occur randomly, a frequency domain kurtosis estimate supplements the power spectral density estimate and, in some cases, can be employed to detect their presence. This has been verified from experiments with real data of randomly occurring signals. In order to better understand the detection of randomly occurring signals, sinusoidal and narrow-band Gaussian signals are considered, which when modeled to represent a fading or multipath environment, are received as non-Ganssian in terms of a frequency domain kurtosis estimate. Several fading and muitipath propagation probability density distributions of practical interest are considered, including Rayleigh and log-normal. The model is generalized to handle transient and frequency modulated signals by taking into account the probability of the signal being in a specific frequency range over the total data interval. It is shown that this model produces kurtosis values consistent with real data measurements. The ability of the power spectral density estimate and the frequency domain kurtosis estimate to detect randomly occurring signals, generated from the model, is compared using the deflection criterion. It is shown, for the cases considered, that over a large range of conditions, the power spectral density estimate is a better statistic based on the deflection criterion.

The resulting fields are also able to propagate to moderately great depths in the ocean in spite of the higher conductivity of seawater. The principal drawback in the use of ELF for communication is the inherent inefficiency of the transmitting antenna. Indeed the waves do, however, penetrate to deeply submerged submarines when all other methods fail. This paper presents a tutorial overview on ELF propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide.

It has been khown for a number of years that significant improvements in performance can be achieved if the non-Gaussian nature of the noise is considered when the ELF receiver is designed. The optimum receiver structure for detecting known threshold signals in additive white non-Gaussian noise is known to be the same as that which should be used if the noise were Gaussian, except that a zero-memory nonlinearity is placed between the receiver input and the Gaussian detector. The input-output characteristic of the nonlinearity is given by\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-d/dx [In P_{n} (x)]</tex>\n, where\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P_{n} (x)</tex>\nis the first-order amplitude probability density function of the additive noise. In this paper, the performance of this receiver, as well as of those where the nonlinearity is replaced by either a clipper, hole puncher, or hard limiter, is analytically evaluated for Middleton's Class B Noise Model. Although this analytical approach is different than the earlier empirical approach taken by Evans and Griffiths, it reaches identical conclusions concerning the design choice of the nonlinear noise processor for use at ELF. Briefly, it confirms that the optimum nonlinearity can achieve an improvement of as much as 20 dB in effective signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, it shows that the more practical clipper achieves an improvement typically within 0.5 dB of the optimum nonlinearity.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1984.1145615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25785/01145615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1984.1145615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25785","startPage":"202","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the locally optimum threshold receiver and several suboptimal nonlinear receivers for ELF noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the locally optimum threshold receiver and several suboptimal nonlinear receivers for ELF noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the locally optimum threshold receiver and several suboptimal nonlinear receivers for ELF noise","sourcePdf":"01145615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027191S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"25785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1145615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145629,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While it has been evident that some form of communication is possible, the ocean has proved to be a distressingly difficult medium in which to achieve high data rates. High data rate transmission requires a wide bandwidth which is severely constrained in the ocean because of the absorption of high-frequency energy. Moreover, the ocean is a very reverberant environment with both time and frequency spreading of signals; this further limits data transmission rates. The net effect of the bandwidth and reverberation constraints has led to either acoustic telemetry systems with low data rates or to the use of tethered systems. Over the years, various forms of acoustic communication systems have been developed. These have included direct AM and SSB for underwater telephones, FM for sensor data, FSK and DPSK for digital data, and parametric sonars for narrow-beam systems. As offshore operations have increased, several other systems have been proposed and/or built to respond to particular needs. In this paper, we review the underwater channel and the limitations that it imposes upon acoustic telemetry systems. We then survey some of the systems that have been built (excluding military systems) and indicate how they use various communication system principles to overcome these limitations.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1984.1145629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1984.1145629","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25786/01145629.pdf","startPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic telemetry - An overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145629/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic telemetry - An overview","volume":"9","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1984","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic telemetry - An overview","sourcePdf":"01145629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031608S","chronDate":"October  1984","isNumber":"25786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"109","articleId":"1145629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1145631,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Ongoing technology developments have narrowed many of the gaps, but major technical, regulatory, and conceptual hurdles remain. Continuing systems concept studies and analyses will be critical to success, as will following a clear strategic R&T road map. This road map must assure both an incremental and evolutionary approach to developing needed technologies and systems is followed, with significant and broadly applicable advances with each increment. In particular, the technologies and systems needed for SPS must support highly leveraged applicability to needs in space science, robotic and human exploration, and the development of space. Considerable progress has been made in the critical area of microwave power transmission. At 5.8 GHz, DC-RF converters with efficiencies over 80% are achievable today. Rectennas developed at 5.8 GHz have also been measured with efficiencies greater than 80%. With optimized components in both the transmitter and rectenna, an SPS system has the potential of a DC-to-DC efficiency of 45%.","doi":"10.1109/MMW.2002.1145675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/25789/01145675.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMW.2002.1145675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space solar power programs and microwave wireless power transmission technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Space solar power programs and microwave wireless power transmission technology","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7484677","htmlLink":"/document/1145675/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space solar power programs and microwave wireless power transmission technology","sourcePdf":"01145675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154273S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"25789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"25789","articleId":"1145675","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145688,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Won Suh","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Kwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/25790/1145688/1145688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae-Won Suh received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea, in 1995, and the M.S. degree in information and communications engineering from Kwanju Institute Science and Technology (K-JIST), Kwangju, Korea, in 1997.

Most of the video coding standards employ the temporal and spatial prediction structure to reduce the transmitted video data. Therefore, the coded video bitstreams are highly sensitive to information loss and channel errors. Even a single bit error can lead to disastrous quality degradation in both time and space. This quality deterioration is exacerbated when no error resilient coding mechanism is employed to protect coded video data against the error prone environments. Error concealment is a data recovery technique that enables the decoder to conceal effects of transmission errors by predicting the lost or corrupted video data from the previously reconstructed error-free information. Motion vector recovery and motion compensation with the estimated motion vector is a good approach to conceal the corrupted macroblock data. In this paper, we develop various error concealment algorithms based on motion vector recovery, and compare their performances to those of conventional error concealment methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error concealment techniques for digital TV","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2002.806797","startPage":"299","endPage":"306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2002.806797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/25790/01145688.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Error concealment techniques for digital TV","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1145688/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497088","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error concealment techniques for digital TV","sourcePdf":"01145688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0407S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"25790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"25790","articleId":"1145688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145702,"authors":[{"name":"Qingyu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/25792/1145702/1145702-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinyu Li received the M.Sc. degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.

A class of frequency-domain adaptive approaches, including the multichannel frequency-domain LMS (MCFLMS) and constrained/unconstrained normalized multichannel frequency-domain LMS (NMCFLMS) algorithms, are proposed. By utilizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and overlap-save techniques, the convolution and correlation operations that are computationally intensive when performed by the time-domain multichannel LMS (MCLMS) or multichannel Newton (MCN) methods are efficiently implemented in the frequency domain, and the MCFLMS is rigorously derived. In order to achieve independent and uniform convergence for each filter coefficient and, therefore, accelerate the overall convergence, the coefficient updates are properly normalized at each iteration, and the NMCFLMS algorithms are developed. Simulations show that the frequency-domain adaptive approaches perform as well as or better than their time-domain counterparts and the cross-relation (CR) batch method in most practical cases.

By assigning each short PN-code more than once, code reuse allows the number of active users to be increased beyond the spreading gain. The proposed receiver is based on a blind single-code multipath joint space-time channel estimation technique that utilizes the concept of the spatio-temporal array manifold, in conjunction with a novel preprocessor, to deal with the multipath problem. From the estimated space-time channel parameters of a particular active code, the subset of parameters of a specific co-code user is then identified, and a single-user receiving weight vector is finally formed. The proposed approach is a subspace type method, and therefore, it is \"near-far\" resistant. Furthermore, in contrast to existing receivers such as the space-time decorrelating detector, the proposed receiver weight vector is tolerant to partial channel estimation errors and the incomplete estimation of channel parameters. The theoretical framework is supported by computer simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.806585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/25792/01145705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.806585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25792","startPage":"39","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A space-time channel estimator and single-user receiver for code-reuse DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A space-time channel estimator and single-user receiver for code-reuse DS-CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2003","accessionNumber":"7684100","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1145705/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A space-time channel estimator and single-user receiver for code-reuse DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01145705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073168S","chronDate":"Jan. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"25792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"25792","articleId":"1145705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145707,"authors":[{"name":"Xueshi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/25792/1145707/1145707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueshi Yang received the B.Sc. degree from the Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, in 2001.","From September 1999 to April 2000, he was a visiting researcher at the Laboratoire des Signaux et Systemes, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, SUPELEC, Paris, France.

Expressions for the estimation bias and variance are derived. This class of distributions behaves as an unbiased estimator in the case of monocomponent signals with a linear IF. However, when the IF is not a linear function of time, then the estimate is biased. Cases of white stationary and white nonstationary additive noises are considered. The well-known results for the Wigner distribution (WD) and linear FM signal, and the spectrogram of signals whose IF may be considered as a constant within the lag window, are presented as special cases. In addition, we have derived the variance expression for the spectrogram of a linear FM signal that is quite simple but highly signal dependent. This signal is considered in the cases of other commonly used distributions, such as the Born-Jordan and the Choi-Williams distributions. It has been shown that the reduced interference distributions outperform the WD but only in the case when the IF is constant or its variations are small.

Averaging of the time-frequency distributions (TFDs) of the data across the array permits the spatial signatures of sources to play a fundamental role in improving the synthesis performance. Array averaging introduces a weighting function in the time-frequency domain that decreases the noise levels, reduces the interactions of the source signals, and mitigates the crossterms. This is achieved independent of the temporal characteristics of the source signals and without causing any smearing of the signal terms. The weighting function may take noninteger values, which are determined by the communication channel, the source positions, and their angular separations. Unlike the recently devised blind source separation methods using spatial TFDs, the proposed method does not require whitening or retrieval of the source directional matrix.

In this context, we determine a maximal invariant statistic with respect to a proper group of transformations that leave unaltered the hypothesis-testing problem under study, devise the optimum invariant detector, and show that no uniformly most powerful invariant (UMPI) test exists. Thus, we establish the conditions an invariant detector must fulfill in order to ensure the CFAR property. Finally, we discuss several suboptimal (implementable) invariant receivers and, remarkably, show that the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is a member of this class. The performance analysis, which has been carried out in the presence of a Gaussian signal array, shows that the proposed detectors exhibit a quite acceptable loss with respect to the optimum Neyman-Pearson detector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7684109","htmlLink":"/document/1145714/","displayDocTitle":"CFAR detection of multidimensional signals: an invariant approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFAR detection of multidimensional signals: an invariant approach","sourcePdf":"01145714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08189S","chronDate":"Jan. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"25792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"25792","articleId":"1145714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1145715,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The key idea of the proposed scheme is to first pass the received signal through a bank of filters, which are designed to enhance signals of interest and suppress interference/noise, and then to derive the code timing from the filtered data. The only required knowledge by the proposed filterbank scheme is the spreading code of the desired user. It can be used in various environments, including frequency-nonselective and frequency-selective, time-invariant, and time-varying fading channels. It can deal with colored channel noise and unmodeled interference, such as inter-cell interference (ICI) and narrowband interference. It has relatively low complexity and can be readily implemented using standard adaptive algorithms. We show that under mild conditions, the proposed scheme yields statistically consistent [in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] code timing estimates, irrespective of the strength of the interference and with only a finite number of data samples. We also derive an unconditional Cramer-Rao bound (UCRB), which serves as a lower bound for all unbiased blind code synchronization schemes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme compares favorably with a popular subspace-based method in terms of user capacity, near-far resistance, and robustness to time-varying fading and unmodeled interference.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.806565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/25792/01145716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.806565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25792","startPage":"160","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filterbank-based blind code synchronization for DS-CDMA systems in multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Filterbank-based blind code synchronization for DS-CDMA systems in multipath fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2003","accessionNumber":"7684111","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1145716/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filterbank-based blind code synchronization for DS-CDMA systems in multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"01145716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073188S","chronDate":"Jan. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"25792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"25792","articleId":"1145716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145734,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Simulation of the recovery of various types of target reflectivity functions (TRFs) for these waveforms were performed and analyzed. In addition, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capabilities for both types of systems were investigated. The results are compared using the error between the interference (jamming)-free recovered TRF and the recovered TRF under noisy conditions as a function of the signal-to-interference/jamming ratio (SIR/SJR). Our analysis shows that noise waveforms possess better jamming immunity (of the order of 5-10 dB improvement over the linear FM chirp) due to the unique radar correlation processing in the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1145747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/25794/01145747.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1145747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECCM capabilities of an ultrawideband bandlimited random noise imaging radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"ECCM capabilities of an ultrawideband bandlimited random noise imaging radar","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1145747/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497149","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECCM capabilities of an ultrawideband bandlimited random noise imaging radar","sourcePdf":"01145747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103815S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"25794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"25794","articleId":"1145747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":1145749,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The clutter process is modeled by the compound-Gaussian distribution. In the first part of the paper, the optimum Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector are sequentially derived both for the Gaussian and the compound-Gaussian scenarios. Different interpretations of the various detectors are provided to highlight the relationships and the differences among them. In particular, we show how the GLRT detector may be recast into an estimator-correlator form and into another form, namely a generalized whitening-matched filter (GWMF), which is the GLRT detector against Gaussian disturbance, compared with a data-dependent threshold. In the second part of this paper, the proposed detectors are tested against both simulated data and measured high resolution sea clutter data to investigate the dependence of their performance on the various clutter and signal parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector subspace detection in compound-Gaussian clutter.

This problem arises when different height contributions collapse in the same range-azimuth resolution cell, due to the presence of strong terrain slopes or discontinuities in the sensed scene. We propose a multilook approach to counteract the presence of multiplicative noise, which is due to the extended nature of natural targets; to this purpose we extend the RELAX algorithm to the multilook data scenario (M-RELAX). A thorough performance analysis of nonparametric (beamforming and Capon) and parametric (root MUSIC and M-RELAX) techniques is carried out based on Monte Carlo simulations and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) calculation. The results suggest the superiority of parametric methods over nonparametric ones.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1145755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/25794/01145755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1145755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25794","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layover solution in multibaseline SAR interferometry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layover solution in multibaseline SAR interferometry","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497157","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1145755/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layover solution in multibaseline SAR interferometry","sourcePdf":"01145755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081767S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"25794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"25794","articleId":"1145755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1145759,"authors":[{"name":"C.

At the same time, the experiment will provide useful elements for the characterisation of the W-band channel, in order to be able to design properly future operational systems working at W-band.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The W-band data collection experiment of the DAVID mission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1145760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/25794/01145760.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1145760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","displayDocTitle":"The W-band data collection experiment of the DAVID mission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1145760/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The W-band data collection experiment of the DAVID mission","sourcePdf":"01145760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082959S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"25794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"25794","articleId":"1145760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145767,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Bo Sun","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Hong-Bo Sun","id":"37277694100"},{"name":"Guo-Sui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Division 421, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Sui Liu","id":"37881379200"},{"name":"Hong Gu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Hong Gu","id":"37591675600"},{"name":"Wei-Min Su","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Wei-Min Su","id":"37595078100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"1145767","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"abstract":"As a useful signal processing technique, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is largely unknown to the radar signal processing community. In this correspondence, the FrFT is applied to airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) slow-moving target detection. For airborne SAR, the echo from a ground moving target can be regarded approximately as a chirp signal, and the FrFT is a way to concentrate the energy of a chirp signal. Therefore, the FrFT presents a potentially effective technique for ground moving target detection in airborne SAR. Compared with the common Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) algorithm, the FrFT is a linear operator, and will not be influenced by cross-terms even if multiple moving targets exist. Moreover, to solve the problem whereby weak targets are shadowed by the sidelobes of strong ones, a new implementation of the CLEAN technique is proposed based on filtering in the fractional Fourier domain. In this way strong moving targets and weak ones can be detected iteratively. This combined method is demonstrated by using raw clutter data combined with simulated moving targets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/25794/01145767.pdf","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1145767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1145767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the fractional Fourier transform to moving target detection in airborne SAR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Object detection","Chirp","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar signal processing","Filtering","Radar detection","Signal processing algorithms","Clutter","Airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","airborne radar","radar detection","Fourier transforms","radar signal processing","chirp modulation","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional Fourier transform","ground moving target detection","radar signal processing","airborne synthetic aperture radar","chirp signal","Wigner-Ville distribution algorithm","CLEAN technique","radar clutter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Application of the fractional Fourier transform to moving target detection in airborne SAR","volume":"38","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1145767/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497167","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the fractional Fourier transform to moving target detection in airborne SAR","sourcePdf":"01145767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060594S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"25794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"25794","articleId":"1145767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145790,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Two kinds of terminals are assumed, namely, bursty terminals for handling bursty traffic and heavily loaded terminals for long-holdingtime message traffic. In this method, the channel frame is divided into two subframes: one is for bursty terminals, and the other is for heavily loaded terminals. The subframe for heavily loaded terminals is further divided into two subchannels, a reservation subchannel (consisting of small slots) and a message subchannel. The bursty terminals transmit their packets in their dedicated subframes on the slotted ALOHA protocol. The heavily loaded terminal having a message transmits, first of all, a reservation packet in a randomly selected small slot of the reservation subchannel to reserve slots in the coming message subchannels. One slot in the same position of each of the succeeding message subchannels is reserved for the terminal until the end-of-use flag, transmitted from the terminal, is received by the satellite. Mean transmission delays for both kinds of traffic in this method are analytically obtained. We show that there exists an optimal frame length which minimizes mean transmission delay for one kind of traffic while keeping mean transmission delay for the other kind under some permissible value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of an Integrated Access Scheme in a Satellite Communication Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145884","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25800/01145884.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of an Integrated Access Scheme in a Satellite Communication Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of an Integrated Access Scheme in a Satellite Communication Channel","sourcePdf":"01145884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03826S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"25800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1145884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145885,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, when the authors recently made some theoretical and experimental assessments of UW missed detection, they found that the above disturbances of the recovered carrier significantly affected the UW missed detection performance. Specifically, the actual UWMP was often worse than that predicted hy Schrempp et al. In fact, a bottoming effect takes place in the UWMP versus UW length characteristic. In this paper, after obtaining the conditional symbol and bit error probabilities for the recovered carrier with some phase error, we discuss the nature of phase fluctuation and cycle slipping for the recovered carrier. Consequently, we derive general expressions for the UWMP in both CPSK and DCPSK transmissions. The UWMP's are numerically calculated, and are then compared to our experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25800/01145888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25800","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Jitter and Cycle Slipping of Phase Reference Upon Unique Word Missed Detection in QPSK Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Jitter and Cycle Slipping of Phase Reference Upon Unique Word Missed Detection in QPSK Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Jitter and Cycle Slipping of Phase Reference Upon Unique Word Missed Detection in QPSK Systems","sourcePdf":"01145888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07581S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"25800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1145888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145898,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The modem performance degradations caused by transmission anomalies, such as amplitude and delay distortions, effects of single and cascaded nonlinearities, and band-limiting effects in nonlinear channels, have been examined using the test data gathered from various field test programs using INTELSAT IV satellites and laboratory simulations using both INTELSAT IV and INTELSAT V parameters. A systematic methodology has been prescribed to reduce the effect of transmission anomalies on the performance of the modems. This paper consists of three main sections; essential features of TDMA modem design, transmission anomalies and their effects on modem performance, and optimization of modem performance in the presence of transmission deviations. The latter includes a brief description of an advanced maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) technique for application to the nonlinear channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Modem Design and Performance in Digital Satellite Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25800/01145898.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1983","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Modem Design and Performance in Digital Satellite Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Modem Design and Performance in Digital Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"01145898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032041S","chronDate":"January  1983","isNumber":"25800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1145898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145900,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To reduce the impairments due to these nonlinearities, a new TWTA linearizer, called a soft-limiter type linearizer (SL-LRZ), has been developed. The overall amplitude characteristic of a TWTA associated with an SL-LRZ is linear up to saturation and has a constant envelope beyond saturation. As to the AM/PM conversion characteristic, it has almost zero phase shift, irrespective of the operating point. The TWTA with SL-LRZ gives better bit error rate (BER) performance and less out-of-band emission (OBE) compared to cases where TWTA is operated by itself or with a conventional linearizer. In this paper, the impact of the new TWTA linearizer upon the transmission performance of a QPSK/TDMA signal is described. The transmission performance over a nonlinear satellite channel has been evaluated experimentally using a 120 Mbit/s QPSK modem and an INTELSAT V channel simulator.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25800/01145900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25800","startPage":"39","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of a New TWTA Linearizer Upon QPSK/TDMA Transmission Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of a New TWTA Linearizer Upon QPSK/TDMA Transmission Performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of a New TWTA Linearizer Upon QPSK/TDMA Transmission Performance","sourcePdf":"01145900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037425S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"25800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1145900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1145902,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Two kinds of earth stations are employed in this system, a small earth terminal (SET) and a master earth station (MES). The SET, which has an antenna about 2 m in diameter, is placed near a subscriber. The MES, which has an 11.5 m diameter antenna, is connected to the terrestrial telephone network through a satellite telephone switching center (STC). There are about 50 two-way channels with bit rates of 32 kbits/s which are achieved through the use of a 30/20 GHz band transponder whose EIRP is about 71.5 dBm, a\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G/T</tex>\nof about 2.7 dB/K and an SET's antenna diameter of 1.8 m.

The two multiple-access polling protocols described here utilize gated and exhaustive disciplines in ordering the transmission of the messages buffered at each terminal. The delay-throughput performance behavior of polling schemes operating under the above mentioned disciplines is derived. Network terminals are modeled as independent sources, which generate messages in accordance with a renewal process. A queueing theoretic approach is employed in deriving the actual message delay. behavior of both schemes. Several comparisons are presented. Interesting results are obtained when we compare the average message waiting times in the case when the network traffic is completely balanced with the ease when this same traffic is mostly due to a single node. The latter case would arise, for example, m networks employing gateways.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","volume":"1","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Message Delay Analysis for Polling and Token Multiple-Access Schemes for Local Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message Delay Analysis for Polling and Token Multiple-Access Schemes for Local Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"01145983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032004S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"25804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1145983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1145992,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Stations transmit on the outbound channel and receive on the inbound channel. The inbound channel is connected to the outbound channel so that all signals transmitted on the outbound channel are duplicated on the inbound channel, thus achieving broadcast communication among the stations. In order to transmit on the bus, the stations utilize a distributed access protocol which achieves a conflict-free round-robin scheduling. This protocol is more efficient than existing round-robin Schemes as the time required to switch control from one active user to the next in a round is minimized (on the order of a carrier detection time), and is independent of the end-to-end network propagation delay. This improvement is particularly significant when the channel data rate is so high, or the end-to-end propagation delay is so large, Or the packet size is so small as to render the end-to-end propagation delay a significant fraction of, or larger than, the transmission time of a packet. Moreover, some features of Expressnet make it particularly suitable for voice applications. In view of integrating voice and data, a simple access protocol is described which meets the bandwidth requirement and maximum packet delay constraint for voice communication at all times, while guaranteeing a minimum bandwidth requirement for data traffic. Finally, it is noted that the voice/data access protocol constitutes a highly adaptive allocation scheme of channel bandwidth, which allows data users to recover the bandwidth unused by the voice application. It can be easily extended to accommodate any number of applications, each with its specific requirements.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25804/01145995.pdf","startPage":"898","endPage":"913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1145995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expressnet: A High-Performance Integrated-Services Local Area Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1145995/","displayDocTitle":"Expressnet: A High-Performance Integrated-Services Local Area Network","volume":"1","issue":"5","publicationDate":"November 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expressnet: A High-Performance Integrated-Services Local Area Network","sourcePdf":"01145995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032736S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"25804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"174","articleId":"1145995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1145996,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The underlying data traffic loads offered to the network are the same for the two methods, although they give rise to different traffic patterns.

In the first scheme, speech activity detectors (SAD's) are not used, and hence, the variations in the voice traffic are only due to the on/off characteristics of voice. In the second scheme, SAD's are employed so that talker silences can he utilized for transmission of additional voice and/or data. In this scheme, the multiplexer performs digital speech interpolation as well as movable boundary frame allocation. The performance measures considered are probability of loss for voice calls, probability of speech clipping, speech packet rejection ratio, and the expected data message delay. In the case of the multiplexer with SAD, a tradeoff exists between data message delay and speech interpolation advantage. Some numerical examples are presented which illustrate the performance of the two multiplexers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25805/01146014.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1983.1146014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1983.1146014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-Time Analysis of Integrated Voice/Data Multiplexers With and Without Speech Activity Detectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech analysis","Packet switching","Communication switching","Switching circuits","Detectors","Telecommunication switching","Time division multiplexing","Interpolation","Delay","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Communication switching","Integrated services digital networks","Multiplexing","Switching, communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1983","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-Time Analysis of Integrated Voice/Data Multiplexers With and Without Speech Activity Detectors","volume":"1","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-Time Analysis of Integrated Voice/Data Multiplexers With and Without Speech Activity Detectors","sourcePdf":"01146014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044568S","chronDate":"Dec 1983","isNumber":"25805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"92","articleId":"1146014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146017,"authors":[{"name":"N.

An important aspect of packet-switched voice is the reconstruction of a continuous stream of speech from the set of packets that arrive at the destination terminal, each of which may encounter a different amount of buffering delay in the packet network. The magnitude of the variation in delay may range from a few milliseconds in a local area network to hundreds of milliseconds in a long-haul packet voice and data network. This paper discusses several aspects of the packet voice synchronization problem, and techniques that can be used to address it. These techniques estimate in some way the delay encountered by each packet and use the delay estimate to determine how speech is reconstructed. The delay estimates produced by these techniques can be used in managing the flow of information in the packet network to improve overall performance. Interactions of packet voice synchronization techniques with other network design issues are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146024/","volume":"1","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1983","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for Packet Voice Synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for Packet Voice Synchronization","sourcePdf":"01146024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027103S","chronDate":"Dec 1983","isNumber":"25805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"126","articleId":"1146024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1146031,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that maximum distance separable real-number BCH (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N, K</tex>\n) codes exist for all nontrivial values of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\nand\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</tex>\n.

The very narrow spectral property of a GTFM signal meets the stringent requirements on bandwidth utilization in modern mobile radio applications. The principle of GTFM is first described. It is then shown that the generation of GTFM signals can be made very simple by the use of an ROM table-lookup technique. By an appropriate choice of parameters in GTFM signal generation at the transmitter, a joint optimization for coherent and noncoherent detection with regard to BER performance in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise can be achieved. For mobile radio applications, the robustness of the detection scheme to fast fading is important. A low-complexity noncoherent receiver is presented, Comprising a frequency discriminator and a simple maximum-likelihood sequence estimator. This receiver performs well in a fast fading environment. Computer simulated results of BER performance of this scheme are given. These results are confirmed by experimental measurements.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1984.1146080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25809/01146080.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1984.1146080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Tamed Frequency Modulation and Its Application for Mobile Radio Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146080/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Tamed Frequency Modulation and Its Application for Mobile Radio Communications","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Tamed Frequency Modulation and Its Application for Mobile Radio Communications","sourcePdf":"01146080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038084S","chronDate":"Jul 1984","isNumber":"25809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"52","articleId":"1146080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146081,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With optimum combining, the signals received by the antennas are weighted and combined to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Thus, with cochannel interference, space diversity is used not only to combat Rayleigh fading of the desired signal (as with maximal ratio combining) but also to reduce the power of interfering signals at the receiver. We use analytical and computer simulation techniques to determine the performance of optimum combining when the received desired and interfering signals are subject to Rayleigh fading. Results show that optimum combining is significantly better than maximal ratio combining even when the number of interferers is greater than the number of antennas. Results for typical cellular mobile radio systems show that optimum combining increases the output signalto-interference ratio at the receiver by several decibels. Thus, systems can require fewer base station antennas and/or achieve increased channel capacity through greater frequency reuse. We also describe techniques for implementing optimum combining with least mean square (LMS) adaptive arrays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1984","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Combining in Digital Mobile Radio with Cochannel Interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Combining in Digital Mobile Radio with Cochannel Interference","sourcePdf":"01146095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038173S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"25809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"586","articleId":"1146095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1146098,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is the purpose of this paper to describe the basic theory and implementation for a particular 2 bits/dimension four-dimensional (two-symbol interval) encoding which readily lends itself to simple encoding and decoding. For this encoding, theory predicts a 1.2 dB gain in noise margin over conventional 16-point (two-dimensional) QAM signaling. Experimental results agreed with the theoretical predictions, and have demonstrated an order of magnitude reduction in block error rate. Extension to eight-dimensional signaling offers a theoretical gain of 2.4 dB over conventional 16-point QAM.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1984.1146103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25810/01146103.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1984.1146103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Signal Constellations for Voiceband Data Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146103/","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Signal Constellations for Voiceband Data Transmission","volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Signal Constellations for Voiceband Data Transmission","sourcePdf":"01146103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048059S","chronDate":"September  1984","isNumber":"25810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1146103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146108,"authors":[{"name":"B.

While we are aware of the many commercial and government organizations active in specialized packet radio systems, our goal is to establish radio networks with inexpensive equipment that is within reach of a large number of individuals with limited budgets. This article will provide a brief history of hardware, software, and protocol development activities as well as a description of amateur packet radio operations. Also discussed are satellite-based operations and development efforts.

Each user transmits, asynchronously, patterns of optical pulses distributed over the fibers and throughout a time frame. Each receiver has a distinct alphabet of patterns, which are detected by optical correlators. Optical correlation by fiber tapped delay lines provides speedy and easy-to-implement decoders. Thus the individual user obtains a transparent low-speed channel by code multiplexing. The reliability of this low-speed channel can be enhanced by redundantly coding the patterns sent by the user, for which the encoding and decoding processes can be performed electronically. This two-step encoding process is simple to implement, highly reliable at reasonable throughput, and provides asynchronous access with simple protocol. Various components and configurations of this access scheme are described. The information theoretic capacity and the error probability for these configurations are derived. We also demonstrate that hardlimiting and filtering at the receiver reduce error probability significantly.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1985.1146265","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25817/01146265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1985.1146265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"916","endPage":"927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pattern Code Modulation and Optical Decoding - A Novel Code-Division Multiplexing Technique for Multifiber Networks","volume":"3","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern Code Modulation and Optical Decoding - A Novel Code-Division Multiplexing Technique for Multifiber Networks","sourcePdf":"01146265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035645S","chronDate":"November  1985","isNumber":"25817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"85","articleId":"1146265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146267,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To characterize the performance of ILAN's, a set of performance evaluation guidelines is established. A class of conceptual solutions for ILAN's is proposed, and its expected performance is obtained by means of simulation. The class includes priority assignment schemes, parametrized sequential and simultaneous scheduling algorithms, and centralized and decentralized access control mechanisms. Our analysis, based upon simulations, shows that the bandwidth freed up by the video and voice calls during periods of little movement in the images and silence periods in the speech signals can be efficiently utilized for graphics and data transmission. The optimal priority mechanism among the different user classes depends on the traffic mix. Finally, it is argued that additional experimentation providing empirical data is imperative for understanding the real-time behavior of ILAN's. Consequently, a network testbed (NTB) called MAGNET is proposed for evaluating the performance of the proposed theoretical systems. It consists of an adaptive ILAN whose mediaaccess protocol is controlled by an Expert System.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1985.1146269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25817","startPage":"859","endPage":"871","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25817/01146269.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1985.1146269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAGNET: Columbia's Integrated Network Testbed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Protocols","Graphics","Speech analysis","Local area networks","Facsimile","Guidelines","Scheduling algorithm","Access control","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Communication system testing","Integrated services digital networks","LANs","Local-area network (LAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","displayDocTitle":"MAGNET: Columbia's Integrated Network Testbed","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAGNET: Columbia's Integrated Network Testbed","sourcePdf":"01146269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043288S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"25817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1146269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1146279,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The processor is partitioned into three subprocessors corresponding to the correlation, state metric evaluation, and state decision-making operations.

The chip is required to evaluate 1024 state transition metrics in each baud interval (about 400 ns) using a pipeline architecture. Simulation and initial test results verify the correct operation of the chip with an adequate-speed safety margin. The theory of operation and architecture of the state metric chip are described. With off-chip memory for state metric storage, the state transition metrics from the correlator chip are used to determine the winning (optimal) path in the Viterbi trellis and to calculate the corresponding 16-bit state metric for each baud interval. Implementation of the third chip which is required to make a state decision regarding the bit sequence sent is presently being investigated.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146284","startPage":"160","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25818/01146284.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a Viterbi Processor for a Digital Communications System with a Time-Dispersive Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Digital communication","CMOS technology","Correlators","System testing","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Decision making","Prototypes","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital communications","Viterbi detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1986","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a Viterbi Processor for a Digital Communications System with a Time-Dispersive Channel","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a Viterbi Processor for a Digital Communications System with a Time-Dispersive Channel","sourcePdf":"01146284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027396S","chronDate":"January  1986","isNumber":"25818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1146284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1146285,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These codes lend themselves for use in a concatenated coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25818/01146285.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Error Decoding with Binary VLSI Logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","displayDocTitle":"Fast Error Decoding with Binary VLSI Logic","volume":"4","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146285/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Error Decoding with Binary VLSI Logic","sourcePdf":"01146285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124961S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"25818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","articleId":"1146285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1146286,"authors":[{"name":"Kam Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Kam Cheng","id":"37067612700"},{"name":"S.

The essential task of this algorithm, pattern matching, has several properties which make it amenable to VLSI realization using a highly concurrent processor architecture. A VLSI pattern-matching chip provides the essential building-block for a specialpurpose codebook-search processor (CSP). The CSP can serve as a generic architecture for a variety of VQ-based speech coding applications. This paper reports on a working VQ processor for speech coding based on a first generation VLSI chip that efficiently performs the essential pattern-matching operation needed for the codebook-search process. Furthermore, the CSP architecture, using this chip, has been successfully incorporated into a compact single-board Vector PCM implementation which operates at rates between 7 and 18 kbits/s. A real-time Adaptive Vector Predictive Coder system using the CSP and augmented by a TMS-32010 programmable signal processor has been designed and recently implemented. We describe the structure of these two VQ coders and present experimental results obtained using the single-board Vector PCM coder.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25818/01146287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25818","startPage":"112","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a VLSI Vector Quantization Processor to Real-Time Speech Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of a VLSI Vector Quantization Processor to Real-Time Speech Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a VLSI Vector Quantization Processor to Real-Time Speech Coding","sourcePdf":"01146287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066204S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"25818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1146287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146289,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The availability of unprecedented processing power and the recognition of \"effective endproduct cost\" as the true measure for VLSI chip fabrication are leading the change over from integrated circuit design to integrated system design.

The systems of equations form an ordered set of equations and they mutually exhibit rank 1 differences. This property is exploited to obtain concurrently the solution of all equations. Via an analysis of the algebraic structure of the systems of equations, we succeed in reducing the complexity to a single matrix inversion, while enhancing the regularity of the algorithm, e.g., by including the back substitution in the main factorization loop. Next, we proceed to map the algorithm on VLS1 hardware, using a very systematic hierarchical temporal/structural decomposition/ partitioning approach. To achieve high throughput, we make extensive use of pipelining and show how a pipelined CORDIC processor element supports the desired operations. The complete equation solver is build around two pipelined CORDIC processor elements and two FIFO-type memories.

Broad-band services and their applications can be roughly divided into four types of communication. The \"dialogue\" services include video telephony, video conferencing, and high-speed document and data transmission. \"Retrieval\" services cover film retrieval, broad-band videotex, document retrieval, high-definition image retrieval, and retrieval of graphics, text, and data. One representative of \"access\" services is cabletext. Of the \"distribution\" services, television is the most prominent. The demand for broad-band services in the office will depend primarily upon cost-effectiveness, and in the home will depend primarily upon anticipated benefits, cost, available purchasing power, and leisure time. In either case, prestige considerations may also play a part. The sine qua non for the fast spread of new broad-band services will at all events be-in addition to acceptable terminal equipment-low user charges.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25821/01146359.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Future Braod-Band Services in the Office and Home","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Image retrieval","B-ISDN","Videoconference","Business","Power generation economics","ISDN","Telephony","Data communication","Videotex"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Business communication","Home communications systems","Integrated services digital networks","Optical fiber communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1986","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Future Braod-Band Services in the Office and Home","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Future Braod-Band Services in the Office and Home","sourcePdf":"01146359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04063S","chronDate":"Jul 1986","isNumber":"25821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1146359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146393,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The performance analysis predicts voice packet delay distributions, which usually have a stringent requirement, as well as data packet delay distributions. The superposition is approximated by a correlated Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which is chosen such that several of its statistical characteristics identically match those of the superposition. Matrix analytic methods are then used to evaluate system performance measures. In particular, we obtain moments of voice and data delay distributions and queue length distributions. We also obtain Laplace-Stieitjes transforms of the voice and data packet delay distributions, which are numerically inverted to evaluate tails of delay distributions. It is shown how the matrix analytic methodology can incorporate practical system considerations such as finite buffers and a class of overload control mechanisms discussed in the literature. Comparisons with simulation show the methods to be accurate. The numerical results for the tails of the voice packet delay distribution show the dramatic effect of traffic variability and correlations on performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25823/01146393.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25823","startPage":"856","endPage":"868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markov Modulated Characterization of Packetized Voice and Data Traffic and Related Statistical Multiplexer Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Markov Modulated Characterization of Packetized Voice and Data Traffic and Related Statistical Multiplexer Performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markov Modulated Characterization of Packetized Voice and Data Traffic and Related Statistical Multiplexer Performance","sourcePdf":"01146393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057641S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"25823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"891","articleId":"1146393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146402,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The analysis of the arrival pattern shows that the arrival processes are neither Poisson nor compound Poisson. An alternative model called \"packet train\" is proposed. In the train model, the traffic on the network consists of a number of packet streams between various pairs of nodes on the network. Each node-pair stream (or node-pair process, as we call them) consists of a number of trains. Each train consists of a number of packets (or cars) going in either direction (from node A to B or from node B to A). The intercar gap is large (compared to packet transmission time) and random. The intertrain time is even larger. The Poisson and the compound Poisson arrivals are shown to be special cases of the train arrival model. Another important observation is that the packet arrivals exhibit a \"source locality.\" If a packet is seen on the network going from A to B, the probability of the next packet going from A to B or from B to A is very high. Implications of the train arrivals and of source locality on the design of bridges, gateways, and reservation protocols are discussed. A numbet of open problems requiring development of analysis techniques for systems with train arrival processes are also described.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25823/01146410.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer networks","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Bridges","Protocols","Area measurement","Pattern analysis","System analysis and design","Resource management","Computer network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer networks","Packet switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","displayDocTitle":"Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic","sourcePdf":"01146410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036537S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"25823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"323","articleId":"1146410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146464,"authors":[{"name":"C.-P.

The sampled-data timing recovery techniques described in this paper are applicable to both echo cancellation and time-compression multiplexing systems. Timing recovery using baud-rate sampling in conjunction with a special pulse-shaping and timing function fulfills all the objectives for timing recovery in this application. It recovers a timing phase that has minimum precursor intersymbol interference, and makes possible the combination of decision feedback equalizer and echo canceler, reducing the convergence time and increasing the step size. The pulse-shaping function can be performed either in the transmitter by means of digital coding, or in the receiver by means of analog filtering. In the latter case, the transmitted pulse is compatible with more conventional approaches. The proposed partial-response line coding, a special form of AMI coding, is less susceptible to line impairments if detected as a two-level signal. Performance by analysis, simulation, and experimental measurements is reported on a variety of cable configurations, some including bridged taps. Analysis of jitter performance leads to design techniques for reducing the jitter magnitude.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1986","volume":"4","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Timing Recovery in Digital Subscriber Loops Using Baud-Rate Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Recovery in Digital Subscriber Loops Using Baud-Rate Sampling","sourcePdf":"01146464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041183S","chronDate":"Nov 1986","isNumber":"25825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1146464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1146466,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This is characterized by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal envelope, and the correlation of random variations across the channel bandwidth. It is therefore important for system design purposes to determine the distribution function for envelope fading, and the frequency correlation characteristics of radio channels in propagation environments where the use of digital radio systems is planned. This paper details experiments that were conducted under conditions similar to those which would be typical on 800/900 MHz band satellite-mobile channels in rural environments. The impulse response functions of measured channels were estimated by operating a pseudonoise channel probe from a 65 m tower through deciduous trees to a receiver at close range. Measurement results include: channel impulse response estimates, envelope fading statistics, and double-sided frequency correlation plots. Comparisons are made between channel characteristics during the summer and during the autumn after the leaves have fallen from the trees. Estimates of digital channel capacity limitations are also given. Aside from the fading statistics, these channel characteristics have not previously been reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Measured Characteristics of 800/900 MHz Fading Radio Channels with High Angle Propagation Through Moderately Dense Foliage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured Characteristics of 800/900 MHz Fading Radio Channels with High Angle Propagation Through Moderately Dense Foliage","sourcePdf":"01146517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052543S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1146517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146519,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Also, the performance of near-optimal stationary process-long observation time [SPLOT] receivers, \"energy detectors,\" and other approximately optimal receivers may be calculated for noncoherent signaling in the same channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Probablity for Optimal and Suboptimal Quadratic Receivers in Rapid Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146519","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25828/01146519.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"Error Probablity for Optimal and Suboptimal Quadratic Receivers in Rapid Rayleigh Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Probablity for Optimal and Suboptimal Quadratic Receivers in Rapid Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"01146519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034507S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"74","articleId":"1146519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146521,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For MPSK, introducing nonuniformity (asymmetry) into the spacing between signal points in the constellation buys a further improvement in performance over that achievable with trellis coded symmetric MPSK, all this without increasing the average or peak power, or changing the bandwidth constraints imposed on the system. Whereas previous contributions have considered the performance of trellis coded modulation transmitted over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the emphasis in this paper is on the performance of trellis coded MPSK in the fading environment. The results will be obtained by using a combination of analysis and simulation. It will be assumed that the effect of the fading on the phase of the received signal is fully compensated for either by tracking it with some form of phase-locked loop or with pilot tone calibration techniques. Thus, our results will only reflect the degradation due to the effect of the fading on the amplitude of the received signal. Also, we shall consider only the case where interleaving/deinterleaving is employed to further combat the fading. This allows for considerable simplification of the analysis and is of great practical interest. Finally, the impact of the availability of channel state information on average bit error probability performance is assessed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis Coded Modulation for 4800-9600 bits/s Transmission Over a Fading Mobile Satellite Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25828/01146526.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"Trellis Coded Modulation for 4800-9600 bits/s Transmission Over a Fading Mobile Satellite Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis Coded Modulation for 4800-9600 bits/s Transmission Over a Fading Mobile Satellite Channel","sourcePdf":"01146526.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024382S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"214","articleId":"1146526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146527,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.M.

The rays have independent uniform phases, and independent Rayleigh amplitudes with variances that decay exponentially with cluster and ray delays. The clusters, and the rays within the cluster, form Poisson arrival processes with different, but fixed, rates.

In this paper, we have focused on the performance of DFE (decision feedback equalization) receivers for communication over 3 kHz bandwidth HF channels. We describe the results of simulations for a wide range of fading rates on simulated and real recorded HF channels, using fractionally spaced DFE receivers. Both LMS (least mean square) and FRLS (fast recursive least squares) adaptation algorithms with periodic restart were evaluated, and both ideal-reference and decision-directed operation was observed. The results indicate that FRLS adaptation yields superior performance to LMS in rapid fading conditions, but that this performance advantage diminishes at low signal-to-noise ratios. Also, fade rates greater than about 1 Hz produced relatively high error rates, irrespective of which adaptation method was employed. Finally, a novel modification of the simple LMS algorithm which improves its tracking ability was evaluated. This involved preceding the LMS DFE receiver with an adaptive lattice whitening filter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25828/01146531.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Equalization Techniques for HF Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Hafnium","Decision feedback equalizers","Least squares approximation","Fading","Data communication","Bandwidth","Least squares methods","Signal to noise ratio","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Decision-feedback equalizers","HF radio communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Equalization Techniques for HF Channels","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Equalization Techniques for HF Channels","sourcePdf":"01146531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061025S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1146531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146533,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The equatorial anomaly region is identified as the most disturbed irregularity environment where the amplitude and phase structures of 250 MHz and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</tex>\n-band scintillations are primarily dictated by the strength of scattering rather than ionospheric motion. In the anomaly region, the spectra of intense amplitude scintillations at these frequencies are characterized by uniform power spectral density from the lowest frequency (10 MHz) to 4 Hz at 257 MHz and to 1 Hz at\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</tex>\n-band (1541 MHz) and steep rolloff at higher fluctuation frequencies with power law indexes of -5 to -7. Such structures are compatible with intensity decorrelation times of 0.1 and 0.3 s at 257 and 1541 MHz, respectively. The phase spectra at 244 MHz are described by power law variation of psd with frequency with typical spectral indexes of -2.4. The strong scattering at VHF induces extreme phase rates of 200\u00b0 in 0.1 s. The 90th percentile values of rms phase deviation at 244 MHz with 100 s detrend are found to be 16 rad in the early evening hours, whereas amplitude scintillation can cover the entire dynamic range of 30 dB not only in the 250 MHz band but at\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</tex>\n-band as well. In the polar cap, the 50th and 90th percentile values of rms phase deviation at 250 MHz for 82 s detrend are 3 and 12 rad, respectively, with comparable values being obtained in the auroral oval. The corresponding values for the S\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</inf>\nindex of scintillation are 0.5 and 0.8 in the polar cap, which are slightly higher than those recorded in the auroral oval. The power law index of phase scintillation at high latitudes is in the vicinity of -2.3, which is not a result of very strong turbulence as in the equatorial region but is considered to be a consequence of shallow irregularity spectral indexes. The phase rates at auroral locations are an order of magnitude smaller than in the equatorial region and attain values of 100\u00b0 in 0.5 s. The extreme variability of ionospheric motion in the auroral oval sensitively controls the structure of scintillations. The long-term morphology (period 1979-1984) of intensity scintillations at 250 MHz in the polar cap shows that, in addition to the absence of diurnal variation of scintillations, and the presence of an annual variation with a pronounced minimum during local summer, there exists a marked solar control of scintillation activity such that it abruptly decreases when the solar activity falls below a threshold level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25828/01146533.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"250 MHz/GHz Scintillation Parameters in the Equatorial, Polar, and Auroral Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["L-band","Frequency","Fluctuations","Scattering","Geophysics","Laboratories","Senior members","Satellite communication","Decorrelation","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arctic regions","Aurora","Ionosphere","UHF radio propagation meteorological factors","VHF radio propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1987","displayDocTitle":"250 MHz/GHz Scintillation Parameters in the Equatorial, Polar, and Auroral Environments","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"250 MHz/GHz Scintillation Parameters in the Equatorial, Polar, and Auroral Environments","sourcePdf":"01146533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07047S","chronDate":"February  1987","isNumber":"25828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1146533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146534,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The times-four method has the virtues that it does not depend upon accurate data decisions, and it does not interact with the receiver's adaptive equalizer. Our results show that the rms phase jitter using this method, for all but the most severe and improbable fades, could be held to a few degrees. Although the measurements were done only for 16 QAM, the analysis predicts only modest increases for higher numbers of levels. The analysis also predicts, and the measurements verify, that the recovered carrier amplitude shrinks to zero for four distinct combinations of fade notch frequency and fade depth.

Their purpose is to reduce the vulnerability of these systems to linear distortion caused by multipath propagation. Linear transversal filters are prominent candidates for the realization of time-domain equalizers, especially for high-capacity applications. They are well known for their good performance and their relatively easy implementation at a high data rate. On the other hand, decision feedback equalizers are known to be very capable of eliminating linear distortion, especially of the so-called minimum-phase type. But realization problems are likely to occur in a high-speed application. A solution is proposed which merges the relative advantages of both the linear transversal and the decision feedback approaches. The goal of a frequency-domain equalizer, which is the restoration of the shape of the power density spectrum of the received signal without any recovered carrier and timing signals, can also be achieved with the aid of a transversal filter. The performance obtained with the joint utilization of the novel timeand frequency-domain equalizers is described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Time- and Frequency-Domain Adaptive Equalization in Multilevel QAM Digital Radio Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146561","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25829/01146561.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1987","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Time- and Frequency-Domain Adaptive Equalization in Multilevel QAM Digital Radio Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Time- and Frequency-Domain Adaptive Equalization in Multilevel QAM Digital Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"01146561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036502S","chronDate":"Apr 1987","isNumber":"25829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1146561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146564,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This fact is becoming increasingly evident for 16 QAM-140 Mbit/s radio systerns at 3.9, 6.7, and 11.2 GHz which are in widespread use in todays long-haul transmission networks. Conceptual and technological measures for making cochannel operation feasible and practical are presented using the example of a system family. By these means, even the capacity of existing 16 QAM-140 Mbit/s radio routes with 40 MHz interleaved channel arrangements can be doubled with the particular advantage of reutilizing the existing antennas and radio equipment with only minor modifications. A progressive filter concept makes orthogonal cochannel transmission possible with negligible adjacent channel spectrum interference. Surface acoustic wave IF filters are used to convert existing systems from 0.5 rolloff to 0.19 rolloff. Special RF channel/antenna arrangements were developed for the transmission of all RF channels in both directions, including space diversity and using only two antennas. A field experiment verified the feasibility of the concept and indicated that a crosspolar interference canceller is generally not necessary for 16 QAM140 Mbit/s cochannel operation.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25829/01146564.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Cochannel Operation for High Spectrum Efficiency Based on the Example of 16 QAM-140 Mbit/s Systems Using Rolloff 0.19","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1987","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Cochannel Operation for High Spectrum Efficiency Based on the Example of 16 QAM-140 Mbit/s Systems Using Rolloff 0.19","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Cochannel Operation for High Spectrum Efficiency Based on the Example of 16 QAM-140 Mbit/s Systems Using Rolloff 0.19","sourcePdf":"01146564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059031S","chronDate":"Apr 1987","isNumber":"25829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1146564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146566,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The new SES standards will use very small antennas with gains between 0 and 15 dBi. At the lower end of SES there will be no antenna stabilization. The communication channel for such small stations is described by a model including multipath fading, Doppler shift, and noise. The results of an extensive measurement program were used to determine the parameters of the channel model, which depend on antenna type and elevation angle. Analytical calculations as well as synthetic and stored channel hardware simulations have been used to determine the performance of several modulation schemes. A complete data link using PSK modems with AFC/Costas loop, interleaving, and FEC codecs at 1.2 kbits/s was built up around a hardware maritime channel simulator, to study the performance of data transmission on the small SES maritime channel.

The results show that at the present time (equivalent to around the year 1990 for onboard use), onboard TDMA equipment with a clock rate of lower than 100 MHz can be reasonably realized by parallel-processed CMOS/BULK LSIC's, while for TDMA equipment with clock rates of higher than 100 MHz, bipolar devices are more appropriate. The boundary clock rate is not so rigid, and toward the year 2000, the boundary will move up to about 200 MHz. Moreover, around the year 2000, GaAs devices will be more widely used for onboard high-bit rate TDMA. It is shown that for carrier frequencies up to 2 GHz, modem implementation in monolithic microwave IC's is most suitable. Moreover, it is found that coherent demodulation will not entail a big penalty in hardware size and power consumption, because of implementing carrier recovery circuits using IC's and LSIC's.

This paper briefly discusses its possible applications, and presents a developed PSK group modem including its algorithm, hardware design, and implementation. In the algorithm, filtering of respective PSK signals is effectively carried out by digital signal processing techniques applied to the digital transmultiplexer. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the difference between the operation timing of the PSK group modem and the symbol timing of each input/output data signal, digital signal processings based on a table-look-up method using ROM and a rate-conversion filter with adaptive weighting are proposed for the modulator and demodulator, respectively. An experimental 4-phase PSK group modem has been developed, and experiments have been conducted under various conditions. The measured performance of the developed hardware is also demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25830/01146585.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PSK Group Modem for Satellite Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Modems","Satellite communication","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Digital filters","Signal processing","Digital signal processing","Timing","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Phase-shift keying","Satellite communication, onboard systems","Transmultiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1987","displayDocTitle":"A PSK Group Modem for Satellite Communications","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PSK Group Modem for Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"01146585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075229S","chronDate":"May 1987","isNumber":"25830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1146585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146588,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this paper, a frequencyselective, slowly fading channel is studied by computer simulation. The unfiltered BPSK, QPSK, OQPSK, and MSK modulations are considered first to illustrate the physical insights and the error mechanisms. Two classes of modulation with spectral-shaping filtering are studied next to assess the tradeoff between spectral occupancy and the performance under the influence of time delay spread. The simulation is very flexible so that different channel parameters can be studied and optimized either individually or collectively. The irreducible BER averaged over fading samples with a given delay profile is used to compare different modulation/detection methods, while the cumulative distribution of short-term BER is employed to show allowable data symbol rates for given values of delay spread. It is found that both GMSK and QPSK with a raised-cosine Nyquist pulse are suitable for a TDM/TDMA digital portable communications channel.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25831/01146591.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effects of Time Delay Spread on Portable Radio Communications Channels with Digital Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1987","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Time Delay Spread on Portable Radio Communications Channels with Digital Modulation","volume":"5","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Time Delay Spread on Portable Radio Communications Channels with Digital Modulation","sourcePdf":"01146591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021697S","chronDate":"Jun 1987","isNumber":"25831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"297","articleId":"1146591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146592,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Because of the different distances between the various users and the base station, the signals received from different users have substantially different power levels. This near/far phenomenon gives rise to a capture effect at the receiver such that when several packets are transmitted simultaneously, the receiver has a good chance of accurately detecting the packet arriving with the highest energy. Moreover, capture can be made near perfect in this environment through the use of properly design spread-spectrum signaling technique that enables the receiver to differentiate among the arriving packets based on both power differences and differing arrival times. We investigate variations to the conventional ALOHA protocols that take advantage of perfect capture to reduce the delays and increase the throughputs of all users, including the furthest one. Three protocols are introduced and compared, which we call \"persistent ALOHA with capture\" (PAC), \"gated ALOHA with capture\" (GAC), and \"gated ALOHA with capture/exhausted\" (GAC/E). Two goals are considered in the comparison: an equatable delay profile among the users, and a small expected number of simultaneously transmitted packets. The latter is quite relevant for the practical implementation of a perfect-capture receiver. We conclude that the GAC/E protocol is most desirable from the twin points of view of delay profile and receiver implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect-Capture ALOHA for Local Radio Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146592","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25831/01146592.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"Perfect-Capture ALOHA for Local Radio Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect-Capture ALOHA for Local Radio Communications","sourcePdf":"01146592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03729S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"25831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"60","articleId":"1146592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146593,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It uses radio signals from several base stations to mitigate the effect of shadow fading, a variation of signal strength over space created by the presence of buildings, foliage, and terrain variations. With a path loss exponent of four and a shadow fading standard deviation of 10 dB, four-branch macroscopic diversity results in a 13 dB improvement in signal strength and a 15 dB improvement in signal to cochannel interference ratio for high user capacity interference-limited operation.

The improvement in signal to cochannel interference ratio is equivalent to a factor-of-five savings of spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1987","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Macroscopic Diversity in Frequency Reuse Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macroscopic Diversity in Frequency Reuse Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"01146594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036994S","chronDate":"Jun 1987","isNumber":"25831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1146594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146595,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The receiver performance is within 1 dB of the theoretical performance of a differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) receiver in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. We also show receiver performance in a multipath fading indoor environment with multipath fade notches of up to 50 dB depth. The indoor channel multipath fading can be overcome by using an equal gain diversity combiner which is suitable when DPSK modulation is used.

This is mainly due to the fact that the nonlinearity of the transmitter power amplifier tends to spread the spectrum and thus eliminate any spectrum efficiency advantage gained through the use of linear modulation methods. In this paper, a linear modulation system is proposed, which solves the above difficulty and which gives higher spectrum efficiency than conventional digital FM. The modulation/demodulation method is\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\pi /4</tex>\nshift QPSK and phase-shift detection with a limiter-discriminator and an integrate-and-dump filter. By introducing a cartesian coordinate negative feedback control, 35 percent power efficiency at 10 W output power and - 60 dB relative out-of-band radiation are simultaneously achieved with a class \"AB\" amplifier, owing to the 29 dB feedback gain. The receiver configuration is easy to realize and gives immunity against fast fading through the use of noncoherent detection with limiter-discriminator. By using a novel decision method, bit error rate performances under both nonfading and fading condition are comparable to those obtained by digital FM. These results make it possible for linear modulation methods to achieve higher spectrum efficiency than is possible with conventional digital FM methods in mobile radio communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25831/01146599.pdf","startPage":"890","endPage":"895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient Digital Mobile Communications with a Linear Modulation Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Digital modulation","Power amplifiers","Land mobile radio","Phase modulation","Negative feedback","Fading","Radio transmitters","Demodulation","Quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Land mobile radio propagation factors","Phase-shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient Digital Mobile Communications with a Linear Modulation Method","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient Digital Mobile Communications with a Linear Modulation Method","sourcePdf":"01146599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027518S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"25831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"144","articleId":"1146599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146600,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Because of the virtual token implementation, Buzz-net retains high efficiency even at very high bus speeds. Efficiency at high speeds and bus unidirectionality make Buzz-net particularly suitable for fiber optics media.

In particular, variable word length coding methods for motion vector and transform coefficients have been discussed assuming low bit rate such as 384 kbits/s for transmission of videoconference sequences. For motion vector information, it is advantageous to employ a one-dimensional code set common to both horizontal and vertical components of motion vectors. The code set can be obtained using a combined distribution of the two components. In order to encode transform coefficients, different methods are applied to significant and insignificant blocks. Run-length coding is adequate for representing clusters of insignificant blocks. In encoding transform coefficients in significant blocks, a zone coding method which encodes transform coefficients within a minimum area enclosing all nonzero coefficients is suitable. Simulation of video sequences shows that a combination of the coding methods described here can achieve high coding efficiency for videoconference sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy Coding for a Hybrid Scheme with Motion Compensation in Subprimary Rate Video Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25833/01146626.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1987","displayDocTitle":"Entropy Coding for a Hybrid Scheme with Motion Compensation in Subprimary Rate Video Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy Coding for a Hybrid Scheme with Motion Compensation in Subprimary Rate Video Transmission","sourcePdf":"01146626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055296S","chronDate":"Aug 1987","isNumber":"25833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1146626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146628,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The Knockout Switch uses a fully interconnected switch fabric topology (i.e., each input has a direct path to every output) so that no switch blocking occurs where packets destined for one output interfere with (i.e., block or delay) packets going to different Outputs. It is only at each output of the switch that one encounters the unavoidable congestion caused by multiple packets simultaneously arriving on different inputs all destined for the same output. Taking advantage of the inevitability of lost packets in a packet-switching network, the Knockout Switch uses a novel concentrator design at each output to reduce the number of separate buffers needed to receive simultaneously arriving packets. Following the concentrator, a shared buffer architecture provides complete sharing of all buffer memory at each output and ensures that all packets are placed on the output line on a first-in first-out basis. The Knockout Switch architecture has low latency, and is self-routing and nonblocking. Moreover, its Simple interconnection topology allows for easy modular growth along with minimal disruption and easy repair for any fault. Possible applications include interconnects for multiprocessing systems, high-speed local and metropolitan area networks, and local or toll switches for integrated traffic loads.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25834/01146645.pdf","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Knockout Switch: A Simple, Modular Architecture for High-Performance Packet Switching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet switching","Communication switching","Delay","Fabrics","Topology","Optical switches","Optical fiber communication","Wideband","Communication networks","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Integrated services digital networks","Optical fiber communication","Packet switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","displayDocTitle":"The Knockout Switch: A Simple, Modular Architecture for High-Performance Packet Switching","volume":"5","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Knockout Switch: A Simple, Modular Architecture for High-Performance Packet Switching","sourcePdf":"01146645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032542S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"25834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"461","articleId":"1146645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146646,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The switch fabric for the slotted broadband packet switch delivers exactly one packet to each output port from one of the input ports which request packet delivery to that output port. The denied requests would try again during the next slot. We discover an effective scheme, implemented by CMOS VLSI with manageable complexity, for performing this function. First, each input port sends a request for a port destination through a Batcher Sorting network, which sorts the request destinations in ascending order so that we may easily purge all but one request for the same destination. The winning request acknowledges its originating port from the output of the Batcher network, with the acknowledgment routed through a Batcher-banyan selfrouting switch. The acknowledged input port then sends the full packet through the same Batcher-banyan switch without any conflict. Unacknowledged ports buffer the blocked packet for reentry in the next cycle. We also give several variations for significantly improved performance. We then study switch performance based on some rudimentary protocols for traffic control. For the basic scheme, we analyze the throughput-delay characteristics for random traffic, modeled by random output port requests and a binomial distribution of packet arrival. We demonstrate with a buffer size of around 20 packets, we can achieve a 50 percent loading with almost no buffer overflow. Maximum throughput of switch is 58 percent. Next, we investigate the performance of the switch in the presence of periodic broadband traffic. We then apply circuit switching techniques and packet priority for high bit-rate services in our packet switch environment. We improve the throughput per port to close to 100 percent by means of parallel switch fabric, while maintaining the periodic nature of the traffic.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25834/01146650.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Broadband Packet Switch for Integrated Transport","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","displayDocTitle":"A Broadband Packet Switch for Integrated Transport","volume":"5","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Broadband Packet Switch for Integrated Transport","sourcePdf":"01146650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047303S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"25834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"397","articleId":"1146650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146657,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Today, it is economically feasible to preallocate buffer space individually to each virtual circuit in every node, so that \"congestion\" ceases to have negative effects. On the contrary, when some low-priority circuits offer more traffic than the network can carry, full utilization of the link bandwidth is achieved. In this context, the allocation of bandwidth can be done automatically and in a \"fair\" way, if packets are multiplexed by circularly scanning all virtual circuits and transmitting one packet from each \"ready\" circuit. This multiplexing algorithm equally distributes all the available link BW to all the VC's that can use it (other than equal distribution is also possible), while it also guarantees an upper bound for the total packet delay through noncongested VC's (VC's that use less than their share of BW). We present methods for hardware implementation of such fast circular scans, and propose a structure for the switching nodes of such networks, consisting of a cross-bar arrangement like a systolic array that performs merge sorting. It is ideally suited for physical layout on printed-circuit boards or with wafer-scale integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Fast switching and fair control of congested flow in broadband networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast switching and fair control of congested flow in broadband networks","sourcePdf":"01146657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033275S","chronDate":"October  1987","isNumber":"25834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"76","articleId":"1146657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1146670,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Eng","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Kai Eng","id":"37087982082"},{"name":"M.

We describe an approach to extend the original Knockout Switch to work with variable-length packets. This new architecture employs an input broadcast bus arrangement to achieve complete interconnection of the inputs and outputs. Consequently, there is no congestion in the switch fabric other than the unavoidable conflict of multiple simultaneous packets destined for the same output. It is with this output contention that the Knockout principle is fully utilized to efficiently concentrate and store contending packets while maintaining the first-in first-out discipline of the packet sequence; and yet the fabric speed required is no more than the input/output line speeds, Under these design goals, no switch can yield better delay/ throughout performance. These are the most important attributes that have been preserved in the current proposal from the original Knockout Switch. For an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N \\times N</tex>\nswitch configuration, the variable-length packet Knockout Switch consists of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\ninput broadcast buses, and an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N:L</tex>\nconcentrator (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L \\ll N</tex>\n) and a shared buffer for each output. The design of each subsystem is discussed with emphasis on possible VLSI realization. Using today's technology, we should be able to implement the proposed switch with both input/output lines and internal hardware operating at 50 Mbits/s. The dimension of the switch (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N \\times N</tex>\n) can grow modularly from say 32 \u00d7 32 to 1024 \u00d7 1024, rendering a total throughput in the range of tens of gigabits per second. Future upgrading of the line interfaces to much higher speed without modification to the internal switch hardware is also possible with a modest restriction on the minimum length of new packets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Packet switching","LAN interconnection","Broadcasting","Fabrics","Hardware","Metropolitan area networks","Telecommunication traffic","Delay","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Packet switching","Switches/switching"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146670","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel6/49/25835/01146670.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.1987.1146670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Knockout Switch for Variable-Length Packets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1987","displayDocTitle":"A Knockout Switch for Variable-Length Packets","publicationDate":"December 1987","volume":"5","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Knockout Switch for Variable-Length Packets","sourcePdf":"01146670.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025575S","chronDate":"December  1987","isNumber":"25835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1146670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1146688,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chih Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao-Chih Hsiao","id":"37087430340"},{"name":"Chin-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Wei Kuo","id":"37087643712"},{"name":"Chien-Chih Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chih Ho","id":"37087590382"},{"name":"Yi-Jen Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Jen Chan","id":"37087162866"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"1146688","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1968},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active inductors","Feedback","CMOS technology","Inductance","Circuit topology","Spirals","Silicon","Impedance","Frequency","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q-factor","CMOS integrated circuits","inductors","circuit feedback","field effect MMIC","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-factor","CMOS active inductor","feedback resistance design","MMIC designs","cascode-grounded active inductor","equivalent inductance","1P6M CMOS technology","self-resonant frequency","dc power consumption","0.18 micron","1.55 GHz","2.5 GHz","8 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146688","abstract":"A novel CMOS active inductor approach, which can improve the quality-factor, was presented in this report.

This method employs a second-degree minimax polynomial approximation to obtain an accurate initial estimate of the reciprocal and the inverse square root values, and then performs a modified Goldschmidt iteration. The high accuracy of the initial approximation allows us to obtain double-precision results by computing a single Goldschmidt iteration, significantly reducing the latency of the algorithm. Two unfolded architectures are proposed: the first one computing only reciprocal and division operations, and the second one also including the computation of square root and inverse square root. The execution times and area costs for both architectures are estimated, and a comparison with other multiplicative-based methods is presented. The results of this comparison show the achievement of a lower latency than these methods, with similar hardware requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2002.1146704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/25838/01146704.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2002.1146704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25838","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed double-precision computation of reciprocal, division, square root, and inverse square root","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-speed double-precision computation of reciprocal, division, square root, and inverse square root","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486352","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1146704/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed double-precision computation of reciprocal, division, square root, and inverse square root","sourcePdf":"01146704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069623S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"25838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"25838","articleId":"1146704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1146705,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

We represent the sensor field as a grid (two or three-dimensional) of points (coordinates) and use the term target location to refer to the problem of locating a target at a grid point at any instant in time. We first present an integer linear programming (ILP) solution for minimizing the cost of sensors for complete coverage of the sensor field. We solve the ILP model using a representative public-domain solver and present a divide-and-conquer approach for solving large problem instances. We then use the framework of identifying codes to determine sensor placement for unique target location, We provide coding-theoretic bounds on the number of sensors and present methods for determining their placement in the sensor field. We also show that grid-based sensor placement for single targets provides asymptotically complete (unambiguous) location of multiple targets in the grid.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2002.1146711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/25838/01146711.pdf","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2002.1146711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid coverage for surveillance and target location in distributed sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1146711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146711/","displayDocTitle":"Grid coverage for surveillance and target location in distributed sensor networks","volume":"51","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486359","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1146711/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid coverage for surveillance and target location in distributed sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01146711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05227S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"25838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"643","xplore-issue":"25838","articleId":"1146711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1146712,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Using two-dimensional numerical simulations, we present an improvement on the existing design wherein the intrinsic device modeling suggests a unity gain frequency f/sub T/ of approximately 5 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1146749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-8 Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1146749/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643753","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simulation, characterization and design of epitaxial emitter NPN 4H-SiC BJTs for amplifier applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation, characterization and design of epitaxial emitter NPN 4H-SiC BJTs for amplifier applications","confLoc":"Newark, DE, USA","sourcePdf":"1146749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039579S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8237","isNumber":"25791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"25791","articleId":"1146749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1146774,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yun Wei","id":"37087164018"},{"name":"K.

An oxidizing agent and an acid have been used in a two step etching cycle to remove aluminum gallium nitride in approximately 5-6 /spl Aring/ increments.

Recessed gate Al/sub 0.35/Ga/sub 0.65/N/GaN HEMTs on sapphire were compared to unrecessed devices realized on the same sample. A fivefold gate leakage decrease and negligible variations on breakdown voltage support digital recessing as a viable solution for highly reproducible low surface-damage gate recessed structures.","doi":"10.1109/LECHPD.2002.1146788","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Not only do these algorithms support soft in. put decoding, but also the application of channel state information for improved decoding performances in fading channel environments. This paper presents a performance evaluation, based on an extensive simulation study, of Viterbi decoded binary Hamming and non-binary Reed-Solomon block codes under flat fading channel conditions with varying Doppler frequencies and line-of-sight signal strengths.

A wide-band flush-mounted antenna called the Letter-rack antenna is designed on the basis of above principles. It is shown why the simple corrugated structure is not suitable for broadband design without some basic changes. A composite system consisting of a series of alternately reversed loops and the corrugated surface structure is constrcuted such that the two periodic structures couple strongly with each other. The behavior of the coupled system is studied on the basis of a coupled mode type of approach. Experimental measurements on the corrugated surface, the uniform Letter-rack antenna and the LP Letter-rack, are reported. It is indicated that the design principles may be applied to building other antennas.","publicationTitle":"1958 IRE International Convention Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1958 IRE International Convention Record","pdfPath":"/iel6/8242/25845/01147184.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRECON.1963.1147184","doi":"10.1109/IRECON.1963.1147184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The letter-rack antenna - A wide-band flush-mounted antenna of log-periodic design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The letter-rack antenna - A wide-band flush-mounted antenna of log-periodic design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1147184/","conferenceDate":"21-25 March 1966","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1963","isConference":true,"volume":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 March 1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The letter-rack antenna - A wide-band flush-mounted antenna of log-periodic design","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01147184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030378S","chronDate":"21-25 March 1966","isNumber":"25845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8242","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1147184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1147197,"authors":[{"name":"On-Ching Yue","affiliation":["Electronics Division, General Dynamics, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"On-Ching Yue","id":"37975008000"},{"name":"E.

If the device operating frequency is high, the frequency time period is short and only a small amount of energy can be given to a charge carrier. Consequently, the power and power amplification must be relatively low. At low frequencies the inverse is true. That is, device physics demands an inverse relation between frequency and power parameters that is independent of the thermal dissipation arguments commonly given to explain the trade-off between these parameters. The analysis leads to an effective means for making comparisons between existing devices. This is illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/IRECON.1965.1147520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRECON.1965.1147520","publicationTitle":"1958 IRE International Convention Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1958 IRE International Convention Record","pdfPath":"/iel6/8242/25849/01147520.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical limitations on frequency and power parameters of transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1147520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 March 1966","displayDocTitle":"Physical limitations on frequency and power parameters of transistors","conferenceDate":"21-25 March 1966","isConference":true,"volume":"13","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1965","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical limitations on frequency and power parameters of transistors","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01147520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022093S","chronDate":"21-25 March 1966","isNumber":"25849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8242","citationCount":"190","articleId":"1147520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1147539,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The procedure enables specification of gain and spatial derivative characteristics, over selected bands of frequency, for multiple points and does not require the use of steering delays. An efficient orthogonal representation for impinging broadband sources is developed and used to specify a minimal set of constraint equations for the beamformer. These equations assure that the resulting structure has the desired response at the specified locations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1149617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"24","publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1986","displayDocTitle":"Spatial filtering with broadband mimimum variance beamformers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial filtering with broadband mimimum variance beamformers","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01149617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022634S","chronDate":"Jun 1986","isNumber":"25864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8258","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1149617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1149628,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However the tolerances of array element positions degrade the array beampattern. Beamforming process is essential to minimize the degradation. A new beamforming algorithm depending on the Parseval's Theorem only is discovered.

The algorithm places no strick requirement on the input signals and therefore is believed to be scene-free. It appears to be suitable for any large phased array system.

The performance characteristics (gain, sidelobe level, null location, beamwidth, etc.) of space communication reflector antenna systems degrade as the reflector surface distorts due to thermal effects from a varying solar flux. The technique reported here will maintain the design radiation performance independently of thermal effects on the reflector surface. With the advent of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC), a greater flexibility in array-fed reflector system design can be achieved. MMIC arrays provide independent control of amplitude and phase for each of many radiating elements of the feed array. The conjugate field matching technique provides a basis for obtaining the required element excitations under surface distortion for maintaining the design radiation performance. It is assumed that the surface characteristics (x, y, z, 1st derivaties, and 2nd derivatives) under distortion are known.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1986.1149756","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel6/8258/25864/01149756.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1986.1149756","publicationTitle":"1986 Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"259","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of reflector surface distortions using conjugate field matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1149756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1986","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of reflector surface distortions using conjugate field matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1149756/","isConference":true,"volume":"24","publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of reflector surface distortions using conjugate field matching","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01149756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036634S","chronDate":"Jun 1986","isNumber":"25864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8258","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1149756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1149780,"authors":[{"name":"R.
