Thus while a random sampling matrix is used to guide the establishment of links between head cluster and sensor nodes, the random linear projection is accomplished. To establish multiple links at the same time, an optical space division multiple access antenna is designed. It works in fixed beams switching mode and consists of optic lens with a large field of view (FOV), fiber array on the focal plane which is used to realize virtual channels segmentation, direction of arrival sensor, optical matrix switch and controller. Based on the angles of nodes' laser beams, by dynamically changing the route, optical matrix switch actualizes the multi-beam full duplex tracking receiving and transmission. Due to the structure of fiber array, there will be several fade zones both in the focal plane and in lens' FOV. In order to lower the impact of fade zones and harmonize multi-beam, a fiber array adjustment is designed. By theoretical, simulated and experimental study, the antenna's qualitative feasibility is validated.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7669687/07669696.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2016.04.06","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2016.04.06","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7669687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7669696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical SDMA for applying compressive sensing in WSN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber sensors","Optical switches","Optical fibers","Laser beams","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network","compressive sensing","space division multiple access","optical matrix switch","laser beam tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7669696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optical SDMA for applying compressive sensing in WSN","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optical SDMA for applying compressive sensing in WSN","sourcePdf":"780789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029654S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","isNumber":"7669687","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7669696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7669704,"authors":[{"name":"Tingpeng Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Logistics Support Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China"],"firstName":"Tingpeng","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Logistics Support Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yanling Qian","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Logistics Support Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China"],"firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Qian"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7669704","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Systems engineering and theory","Logistics","Resource management","Manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hungarian algorithm","assignment problem","virtual job","serial-parallel system","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7669704","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7669687/07669704.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2016.04.14","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2016.04.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7669687","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems of serial-parallel systems","abstract":"In order to overcome the shortcoming of the classical Hungarian algorithm that it can only solve the problems where the total cost is the sum of that of each job, an improved Hungarian algorithm is proposed and used to solve the assignment problem of serial-parallel systems. First of all, by replacing parallel jobs with virtual jobs, the proposed algorithm converts the serial-parallel system into a pure serial system, where the classical Hungarian algorithm can be used to generate a temporal assignment plan via optimization. Afterwards, the assignment plan is validated by checking whether the virtual jobs can be realized by real jobs through local searching. If the assignment plan is not valid, the converted system will be adapted by adjusting the parameters of virtual jobs, and then be optimized again. Through iterative searching, the valid optimal assignment plan can eventually be obtained. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, the valid optimal assignment plan is applied to labor allocation of a manufacturing system which is a typical serial-parallel system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7669704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"27","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems of serial-parallel systems","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improved Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems of serial-parallel systems","sourcePdf":"858870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033889S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","isNumber":"7669687","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7669704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
