By exploiting the multichannel nature of the problem, where multiple acquisitions of the same image function are obtained with different sensitivity weightings, we obtain a subspace-based framework for directly solving for the sensitivity functions. The proposed approach does not rely on the sum-of-squares assumption used in existing estimation schemes; this assumption tends to be violated towards the center of the image, thus leading to errors in the sensitivity estimates. Our approach eliminates this problem, producing superior sensitivity estimates in comparison to the sum-of-squares technique. In addition, the proposed restoration procedure is non-iterative, computationally efficient, and applicable both to cases where pilot scans are available or where auto-calibration data are collected with each scan. We present experimental results using actual and simulated data to assess the performance of our approach in comparison with existing methods","pdfPath":"/iel5/4193196/4193197/04193236.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4193197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2007.356802","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2007.356802","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4193236","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Coils","Finite impulse response filter","Image restoration","Deconvolution","Filtering","Polynomials","Jacobian matrices","Computational modeling","Brain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","channel estimation","image restoration","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel MRI","multichannel estimation","receiver coil sensitivity","sum-of-squares technique","image restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4193236/","displayDocTitle":"MULTICHANNEL ESTIMATION OF COIL SENSITIVITIES IN PARALLEL MRI","accessionNumber":"9497855","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4193236/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 April 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MULTICHANNEL ESTIMATION OF COIL SENSITIVITIES IN PARALLEL MRI","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043584S","chronDate":"12-15 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4193196","isNumber":"4193197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4193196","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4193197","articleId":"4193236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4193266,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrajit L.

increasingly malignant stages of cancer according to qualitative analysis of tissue architecture. The Gleason grading system has been shown to suffer from inter- and intra-observer variability. In this paper we present a new method for automated and quantitative grading of prostate biopsy specimens. A total of 102 graph-based, morphological, and textural features are extracted from each tissue patch in order to quantify the arrangement of nuclei and glandular structures within digitized images of histological prostate tissue specimens. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the digitized histology slides into one of four different tissue classes: benign epithelium, benign stroma, Gleason grade 3 adenocarcinoma, and Gleason grade 4 adenocarcinoma. The SVM classifier was able to distinguish between all four types of tissue patterns, achieving an accuracy of 92.8% when distinguishing between Gleason grade 3 and stroma, 92.4% between epithelium and stroma, and 76.9% between Gleason grades 3 and 4. Both textural and graph-based features were found to be important in discriminating between different tissue classes. This work suggests that the current Gleason grading scheme can be improved by utilizing quantitative image analysis to aid pathologists in producing an accurate and reproducible diagnosis","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2007.357094","publicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/4193196/4193197/04193528.pdf","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2007.357094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4193197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AUTOMATED GRADING OF PROSTATE CANCER USING ARCHITECTURAL AND TEXTURAL IMAGE FEATURES","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4193528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4193528/","displayDocTitle":"AUTOMATED GRADING OF PROSTATE CANCER USING ARCHITECTURAL AND TEXTURAL IMAGE FEATURES","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9506433","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4193528/","conferenceDate":"12-15 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AUTOMATED GRADING OF PROSTATE CANCER USING ARCHITECTURAL AND TEXTURAL IMAGE FEATURES","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045467S","chronDate":"12-15 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4193196","isNumber":"4193197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4193196","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4193197","articleId":"4193528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4194752,"authors":[{"name":"Sumedh Puranik","affiliation":["ARCON Corporation, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4194746/4194752/4194752-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jitendra K.

First MSTAR image chips are represented as fine and raw feature vectors, where raw features compensate for the target pose estimation error that corrupts fine image features. Then, the chips are classified by using the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm with the radial basis function (RBF) network as the base learner. Since the RBF network is a binary classifier, the multiclass problem was decomposed into a set of binary ones through the error-correcting output codes (ECOC) method, specifying a dictionary of code words for the set of three possible classes. AdaBoost combines the classification results of the RBF network for each binary problem into a code word, which is then \"decoded\" as one of the code words (i.e., ground-vehicle classes) in the specified dictionary. Along with classification, within the AdaBoost framework, we also conduct efficient fusion of the fine and raw image-feature vectors. The results of large-scale experiments demonstrate that our ATR scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art systems reported in the literature","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4194746/04194758.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.357120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.357120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4194746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4194758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive boosting for SAR automatic target recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Target recognition","Radial basis function networks","Dictionaries","Land vehicles","Image databases","Spatial databases","Estimation error","Decoding","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","object recognition","radial basis function networks","road vehicles","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive boosting","SAR automatic target recognition","ground vehicle classification","target acquisition","image chips","AdaBoost algorithm","radial basis function network","RBF","error-correcting output codes method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4194758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive boosting for SAR automatic target recognition","volume":"43","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4194758/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2007","accessionNumber":"9457755","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive boosting for SAR automatic target recognition","sourcePdf":"43aes01-Sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067055S","chronDate":"January  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4194746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"4194746","articleId":"4194758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4194761,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Julien","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4194746/4194761/4194761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Julien received his B.Eng. in 2001 in digital communications from ENAC and his Ph.D. in 2005 from the Department of Geomatics Engineering of the University of Calgary, Canada.","He is an assistant professor at the ENAC (Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile) signal processing laboratory where he is involved in many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) projects."]},"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Julien","id":"37298493000"},{"name":"Christophe Macabiau","affiliation":["LTST, ENAC, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4194746/4194761/4194761-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Christophe Macabiau graduated as an electronics engineer in 1992 from the ENAC (Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile) in Toulouse, France.

Fast simulation using IS methods has been notably successful in the study of conventional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) radar detectors, and in several other applications. The principal objectives here are to examine the viability of using these methods for STAP detectors, develop them into powerful analysis and design algorithms and, in the long term, use them for synthesizing novel detection structures. The adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector has been analyzed successfully using fast simulation. Of two biasing methods considered, one is implemented and shown to yield good results. The important problem of detector threshold determination is also addressed, with matching outcome. As an illustration of the power of these methods, two variants of the square-law AMF detector that are thought to be robust under heterogeneous clutter conditions have also been successfully investigated. These are the envelope-law and geometric-mean STAP detectors. Their CFAR property is established and performance evaluated. It turns out the variants have detection performances better than those of the AMF detector for training data contaminated by interferers. In summary, the work reported here paves the way for development of advanced estimation techniques that can facilitate design of powerful and robust detection algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Radar detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Robustness","Radar applications","Matched filters","Analytical models","Clutter","Envelope detectors","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","importance sampling","mean square error methods","radar detection","space-time adaptive processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive importance sampling","false alarm probabilities","space-time adaptive processing","fast simulation","constant false alarm rate","radar detectors","adaptive matched filter detector","biasing methods","detector threshold determination","matching outcome","envelope-law STAP detectors","geometric-mean STAP detectors","advanced estimation","robust detection algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.357133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4194746/04194771.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4194746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.357133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Importance sampling for characterizing STAP detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4194771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Importance sampling for characterizing STAP detectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4194771/","volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4194771/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9457768","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance sampling for characterizing STAP detectors","sourcePdf":"43aes01-Srinivasan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054116S","chronDate":"January  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4194746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4194746","articleId":"4194771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4194772,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Perrins","affiliation":["University of Kansas, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4194746/4194772/4194772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik Perrins (S\u203296\u2014M\u203205\u2014SM\u203206) received his B.S.

However, the optimum receiver requires 128 real-valued matched filters and keeps track of the waveform state with a trellis of 512 states and 2048 branches. Various complexity-reducing techniques are applied and the resulting loss in detection efficiency is quantified. It is shown that the full 512-state trellis is not required to achieve desirable detection efficiency: two different 32-state configurations were found to perform within 0.05 dB of optimal; two different 16-state configurations were found to perform within 0.80 dB of optimal; and an 8-state configuration was found to perform within 1.05 dB of optimal.

Both the ordinary radar with a single transmitter and receiver and the recently proposed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar are considered. A random target impulse response is used to model the scattering characteristics of the extended (nonpoint) target, and two radar waveform design problems with constraints on waveform power have been investigated. The first one is to design waveforms that maximize the conditional mutual information (MI) between the random target impulse response and the reflected waveforms given the knowledge of transmitted waveforms. The second one is to find transmitted waveforms that minimize the mean-square error (MSE) in estimating the target impulse response. Our analysis indicates that under the same total power constraint, these two criteria lead to the same solution for a matrix which specifies the essential part of the optimum waveform design. The solution employs water-filling to allocate the limited power appropriately.

However, for dynamic unstructured environments and many real-world applications, there is a need to cope with large amounts of uncertainties. The traditional type-1 FLC using crisp type-1 fuzzy sets cannot directly handle such uncertainties. A type-2 FLC using type-2 fuzzy sets can handle such uncertainties to produce a better performance. Hence, type-2 FLCs will have the potential to overcome the limitations of type-1 FLCs and produce a new generation of fuzzy controllers with improved performance for many applications, which require handling high levels of uncertainty. This paper introduces briefly the interval type-2 FLC and its benefits. We also present briefly the type-2 FLC application to three challenging domains: industrial control, mobile robots control and ambient intelligent environments control.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2007.357192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/4155616/04195040.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2007.357192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4155616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-2 FLCs: A New Generation of Fuzzy Controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195040/","displayDocTitle":"Type-2 FLCs: A New Generation of Fuzzy Controllers","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9293513","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195040/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-2 FLCs: A New Generation of Fuzzy Controllers","sourcePdf":"22007--10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052764S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"4155616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"310","xplore-issue":"4155616","articleId":"4195040","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4195041,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"4195041","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":748},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195041","abstract":"Interval type-2 fuzzy sets were used to model the uncertainty that is associated with the various parameters in objective function-based clustering. The purpose was to represent and manage the uncertainty in the cluster memberships by incorporating interval type-2 fuzzy sets. As a result, interval type-2 clustering methods were obtained by modifying the prototype-updating and hard-partitioning procedures in the type-1 fuzzy objective function-based clustering. As a consequence, the management of uncertainty by an interval type-2 fuzzy approach aids cluster prototypes to converge to a more desirable location than a type-1 fuzzy approach. Several examples illustrated the effectiveness of interval type-2 fuzzy approach methods. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the parameters for other existing clustering algorithms can be considered in the development of several other interval type-2 clustering algorithms.

For a downlink scenario, we propose flow metrics that dynamically capture the extent to which flows of diverse QoS types merit bandwidth allocation. Using these flow metrics, we propose a scheduling rule for a mixture of real-time, non real-time and best effort traffic. Our system model uses queues implemented as finite length buffers for each of the downlink flows.

transform (DFT)-based channel estimators provides good performance with low complexity. Since its performance is influenced by estimated channel taps to lessen the noise effects, it is necessary to estimate the number of the channel taps and their time-domain position. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified DFT-based channel estimator with channel impulse response (CIR) adaptation which can simply find the significant channel path delays. The CIR adaptation uses scaling coefficients and threshold level which are generated by Monte-Carlo simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a similar performance of the frequency-domain linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) method. Moreover, its performance is rather better than that of the LMMSE method under symbol timing offset (STO).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFT-based Channel Estimation Using CIR Adaptation in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358252","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195059/04195075.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"DFT-based Channel Estimation Using CIR Adaptation in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4195075/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9538804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFT-based Channel Estimation Using CIR Adaptation in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043242S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4195059","articleId":"4195075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195098,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Yamanaka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Yamanaka","id":"37293588800"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Kota Higashi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Higashi","id":"37285214300"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Radrix, Inc., Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195098","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Field programmable gate arrays","Parity check codes","Frequency synchronization","Wireless LAN","Standards development","Code standards","MIMO","OFDM","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","error correction codes","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prototype board","IEEE 802.11n","IP set","field-programmable gate array","next generation wireless LAN standard","MIMO-OFDM","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","low-density parity check code error correction","large-scale FPGA","mesh connections","frame synchronization","carrier synchronization","co-channel interference cancellation","inverse fast Fourier transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prototype boad","IEEE802.11n","IP"]}],"abstract":"A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototyping board and several IP sets have been developed for the next generation wireless LAN standard, IEEE802.11n.

memory, especially NAND flash memory, has become a major method for data storage in mobile systems because of its small size, shock resistance, and low power consumption. When the flash memory is used, conventional file systems cannot be used upon a bare flash memory due to physical characteristics. Instead, few flash file systems are developed which use the direct interfaces with flash memory. However, their data recording method have problems as the capacity of flash increases, because these use log based data recording method, which means that they encapsulate the metadata information into the data node for all files when data are written. Their method is good for the small capacity of flash memory, but not adequate for large sizes because it consumes more mount time, memory footprint and operation times as capacity increases. In this paper, we present an efficient metadata management scheme of flash file system for giga scale flash memory. Specifically, we design the hashing directory structure for directory management and two level index structure for file index management. These management scheme can reduce the file system mount time and memory footprint during runtime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9529808","htmlLink":"/document/4195133/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hashing Directory Scheme for NAND Flash File System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hashing Directory Scheme for NAND Flash File System","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034638S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4195059","articleId":"4195133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4195135,"authors":[{"name":"Kota Higashi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Higashi","id":"37285214300"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195135","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Detectors","MIMO","Detection algorithms","Baseband","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Block codes","Space technology","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","GLST-MIMO detector","group layered space time","GLST-MIMO wireless communication systems","computational complexity","channel matrix","80 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["group layered space-time-MIMO system","layered space-time","space-time block coding","FPGA implementation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an FPGA implementation of a GLST-MIMO detector for GLST-MIMO wireless communication systems.

However, performance of such scheme varies with different packet lengths. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hybrid automatic repeat request protocol (AH-ARQ) which continuously estimates throughput efficiency of different packet lengths with average number of packet transmission in different decoding conditions while combining received packets. By estimating channel condition and adapting packet length, throughput efficiency can be maximized. Other than former studies, throughput efficiencies of different packet lengths can be predicted without knowledge of channel condition such as Doppler frequency or vehicle speed which needs extra modification or device to the system because average bit error probability can be seen as constant for different packet lengths in the same channel condition. We also consider the influence of observation interval (OI) and difference between throughput efficiencies of different packet lengths (DTE). With optimized OI and DTE, simulation result shows that AH-ARQ can adaptively sense change of channel condition and maximize the throughput efficiency continuously in spite of its simplicity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) with a Novel Packet Reuse Scheme for Wireless Communications","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358427","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195059/04195206.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) with a Novel Packet Reuse Scheme for Wireless Communications","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4195206/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9518375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) with a Novel Packet Reuse Scheme for Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080182S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","xplore-issue":"4195059","articleId":"4195206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4195208,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Falahati","affiliation":["Department ofElectrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Falahati","id":"37300886700"},{"name":"Majid R.

Among a number of techniques to reduce the high PAPR, clipping is the simplest and most easily implementable method. Clipping introduces the clipping noise, which affects pilot data as well as information data. As a result, the performance of channel estimation and system decreases due to a nonlinear distortion process. In this paper, the proposed block type pilot protection technique for clipping has the properties, such as distortionless pilot and no side information. And simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme has better BER performance and its complexity decreases.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358481","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195059/04195260.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Type Pilot Protection Technique for Clipping in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195260/","displayDocTitle":"Block Type Pilot Protection Technique for Clipping in OFDM Systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9551097","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195260/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Type Pilot Protection Technique for Clipping in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0407S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","xplore-issue":"4195059","articleId":"4195260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195264,"authors":[{"name":"Do TrongHieu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"lastName":"Do TrongHieu","id":"37087026317"},{"name":"Sang-Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37422543500"},{"name":"Young-Seob Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Seob","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066440100"},{"name":"Sae-Young Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sae-Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37291425800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195264","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Throughput","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink throughput","cellular networks","information-theoretic approach","practical transmission schemes","multiple input multiple output cellular architecture","zero forcing criterion","multiplexing gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink thoughput","multiplexing gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195264","abstract":"Throughput (or maximum sum rate) of the downlink in cellular networks has always been an issue of importance since it reveals the maximum capability of the networks. In this paper we employ an information-theoretic approach to establish upperbounds and lowerbounds on the throughput of the downlink in cellular networks. These bounds may serve as baselines for evaluating performance of practical transmission schemes. In a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) cellular architecture we use the zero forcing criterion to design the optimal number of antennas at each receiver given the number of antennas at each transmitter, thereby deriving a lowerbound for the total achievable multiplexing gain. This lowerbound is shown to meet the upperbound in certain cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358485","startPage":"864","endPage":"868","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195059/04195264.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Bounds on Downlink Throughput of Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Bounds on Downlink Throughput of Cellular Networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4195264/","accessionNumber":"9551088","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195264/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Bounds on Downlink Throughput of Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056113S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","xplore-issue":"4195059","articleId":"4195264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4195302,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School ofInformation Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292635800"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School ofInformation Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"},{"name":"Shouyi Yang","affiliation":["School ofInformation Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shouyi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292116100"},{"name":"Lin Qi","affiliation":["School ofInformation Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qi","id":"37288542200"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Mie University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195302","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Power amplifiers","Digital modulation","Fading","High power amplifiers","Computer simulation","Solid state circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","travelling wave amplifiers","travelling wave tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation method","nonlinear distortion","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multi-carrier digital modulation technique","frequency selective fading","high power amplifier","peak-to-average power ratio","nonlinear compensation methods","bit error rate","traveling wave tube amplifier","solid state power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","HPA","nonlinear compensation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier digital modulation technique that has been under extensive study and research in recent years, in terms of considering its various advantages in combating the severe effects of the frequency selective fading. However, the OFDM system suffers from the strong sensitivity to the nonlinear distortion, introduced by the transmitting high power amplifier (HPA), since the OFDM system has the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Based on the analyses of some classic nonlinear compensation methods, we propose a new approach to compensate the nonlinearity in this paper. Its performance is verified through computer simulations. Specifically, the enhanced performance in terms of the bit error rate (BER) is documented for both the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and the solid state power amplifier (SSPA).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compensation Method for Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM System","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358501","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195290/04195302.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Compensation Method for Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM System","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4195302/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9551099","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compensation Method for Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM System","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-2-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06431S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4195290","articleId":"4195302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195306,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37288332500"},{"name":"Liu Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293114600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195306","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Timing","Polynomials","Frequency synchronization","Clocks","Sampling methods","Lagrangian functions","Band pass filters","Attenuation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","frequency-domain analysis","interpolation","radio receivers","signal sampling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["upsampling methods","interpolation fundamentals","symbol timing recovery","digital receivers","zero-insertion expander","zero-order-hold expander","frequency domain","low band filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interpolation","up-sampling","attenuation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195306","abstract":"The digital method for symbol timing recovery has been used for several years and many scholars have proposed a great deal of methods for it.

The DFS is a good mechanism to overcome this co-existence issue, and is mandatory for unlicensed bands operation in IEEE 802.16e specification. Compared with the static frequency selection scheme defined in IEEE 802.16e specification, a particular DFS scheme is proposed for unlicensed bands operation.

However, the complexity of the SD is higher than that of V-BLAST in low SNR region. But, the V-BLAST detection its performance suffers degradation because of the error propagation. In this paper, we propose two reliability discrimination (RD) schemes to reduce complexity of SD. Basically, estimate a symbol by V-BLAST in proposed schemes. One is RDED that discriminates the reliability of the estimated symbol by pre-calculated Euclidean distance. The other RDMD that discriminates the reliability by pre-calculated Manhattan distance. Then we can determine whether use SD algorithm or not by pre-calculated distances of RD. Therefore, the computational complexity of proposed schemes can be significantly reduced with acceptable performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195435/04195483.pdf","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1631","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoder for MIMO Systems Using Reliability Discrimination Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Maximum likelihood detection","Euclidean distance","Computational complexity","Receiving antennas","Degradation","Vectors","Reliability engineering","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity sphere decoder","MIMO systems","reliability discrimination algorithms","maximum likelihood detection","V-BLAST detection","error propagation","Euclidean distance","Manhattan distance","computational complexity","performance degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoder for MIMO Systems Using Reliability Discrimination Algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4195483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9518456","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoder for MIMO Systems Using Reliability Discrimination Algorithms","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046772S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4195435","articleId":"4195483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4195484,"authors":[{"name":"Sangho Ahn","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37289679200"},{"name":"Changyoon Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37066055300"},{"name":"Sanghun Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291922000"},{"name":"Seokho Yoon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokho","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37279393400"},{"name":"Sun Yong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Konkuk University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sun Yong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37695169700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195484","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Timing","AWGN","Robustness","Fast Fourier transforms","Sun","Signal generators","Fading","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","integer frequency offset estimation scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","timing offset range"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency offset estimation","OFDM","differential combining"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel integer frequency offset estimation scheme which is not affected by the timing offset is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

In this paper, we propose differential STBC MIMO-OFDM system with CDD. This structure can provide a very close performance to that of the conventional diversity scheme with maximum likelihood (ML) detection without channel estimation block while the receiver structure is highly simplified. BER (bit error rate) performance of the proposed system is simulated for an AWGN channel by theoretical and simulated approaches.

In this paper, we address rendezvous algorithm in CR network with centralized control. We propose the resource-aware rendezvous algorithm which is based on the novel spectrum hole management scheme.

By using the revised scaled-QR decomposition, the order of PEDs from the same parent nodes are fixed. This eliminates the sorting operations at each step. The average decoding latency of 4times4 64QAM is 160 clocks and that of other modulations are also analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Decoding","Decision trees","Computer architecture","Matrix decomposition","Delay","MIMO","Degradation","Sorting","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","matrix algebra","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["list sphere decoder","VLSI architecture","scaled-QR decomposition","real-valued channel matrix","average decoding latency","partial Euclidean distance","QAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195498","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358696","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1696","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195435/04195498.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195498/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architecture of List Sphere Decoder","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","volume":"3","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538936","htmlLink":"/document/4195498/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architecture of List Sphere Decoder","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070656S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","xplore-issue":"4195435","articleId":"4195498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRINIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4195505,"authors":[{"name":"SangJun Ko","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information, Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"SangJun","lastName":"Ko","id":"37289335500"},{"name":"KyungHi Chang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information, Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"KyungHi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195505","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"This paper solves the problem of finding a suitable sub-channel and power joint allocation method for multiple users in 802.16e OFDMA/TDD cellular systems. The joint allocation is that firstly the sub-channel is allocated to the users and then suitable power is allocated. We propose a FASA (fairness insured aggressive sub-channel allocation) algorithm which is a dynamic channel allocation algorithm considering all users' channel state information conditionally to maximize fairness and throughput. We compare the FASA algorithm with the conventional algorithms in the 2-tier cell environment and then analyze the performance of each algorithm through computer simulation in the downlink of 802.16e OFDMA/TDD system. The improved CHC algorithm, which is dynamic power allocation algorithm, is also proposed in this paper. The Improved CHC algorithm collects the extra of the downlink transmit power and then re-allocates it to other users. Simulation results show that the proposed improved CHC algorithm additionally increases the fairness and sector throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195435/04195505.pdf","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1731","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Optimization of a 802.16e OFDMA/TDD Cellular System using the Joint Allocation of Sub-channel and Transmit Power","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","Heuristic algorithms","Channel state information","Information technology","Channel allocation","Downlink","Optimization methods","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["802.16e OFDMA","TDD cellular system","power joint allocation method","fairness insured aggressive subchannel allocation","dynamic channel allocation algorithm","channel state information","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["802.16e","OFDMA/TDD","Sub-channel","Transmit Power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Optimization of a 802.16e OFDMA/TDD Cellular System using the Joint Allocation of Sub-channel and Transmit Power","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4195505/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9538943","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Optimization of a 802.16e OFDMA/TDD Cellular System using the Joint Allocation of Sub-channel and Transmit Power","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049734S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4195435","articleId":"4195505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195509,"authors":[{"name":"SunBum Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"SunBum","lastName":"Han","id":"37291431600"},{"name":"JongKyoung Kim","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"JongKyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293479400"},{"name":"SoonUp Hwang","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"SoonUp","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37292256900"},{"name":"JongSoo Seo","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"JongSoo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195509","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"In this paper, a simple subcarrier-and-bit allocation algorithm is proposed to solve the minimization problem of the outage rate by giving different priority to each user.

High-accuracy interpolation is necessary because we perform channel equalization with SPs, which are inserted in transmit signals nonrectangularly. This interpolation is performed with a 2D filter that has a nonrectangular spectrum. However, the generation of the 2D filter involves heavy computational complexity. We propose a method of reducing the computational complexity by designing separable 2D filters. Then the 2D filters are generated from 1D prototype filters. We'll also indicate the effectiveness of some methods of generating 1D prototype filters. In addition, we present simulation results that compare our method with some conventional methods and show its effectiveness.","publicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"The 9th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195058/4195435/04195539.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1879","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2007.358737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2007.358737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DTTB Channel Estimation Using Separable 2D Filters on Nonrectangular Lattice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"DTTB Channel Estimation Using Separable 2D Filters on Nonrectangular Lattice","htmlLink":"/document/4195539/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9551188","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DTTB Channel Estimation Using Separable 2D Filters on Nonrectangular Lattice","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049378S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195058","isNumber":"4195435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195058","xplore-issue":"4195435","articleId":"4195539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4195543,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong Hoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292739100"},{"name":"Jin Yong Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Yong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37310552000"},{"name":"Jong Soo Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-131-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4195543","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Diversity reception","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","OFDM","Bit error rate","Phase detection","Phase frequency detector","Differential phase shift keying","Degradation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","diversity reception","error statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback differential detection","postdetection diversity reception","DPSK-OFDM systems","differential phase shift keying","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate","inter-carrier interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision feedback differential detection (DF-DD)","differential phase shift keying (DPSK)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","postdetection diversity reception"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a scheme of decision feedback differential detection (DF-DD) with postdetection diversity reception for differential phase shift keying (DPSK)/orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The DF-DD with postdetection diversity reception can combat the inter-carrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems and achieve better BER performance as compared to DF-DD without postdetection diversity reception. In this correspondence, we combined two techniques, DF-DD and postdetection diversity reception, in DPSK/OFDM systems.

Within this scenario, the interference originating from neighboring cells, called intercell interference, is one of the reasons for limiting the performance improvement in multicell environments. There have been many detection techniques proposed to reduce the intracell interference. Unfortunately, the mitigation of intercell interference in MC-CDMA cellular systems is still far from the desired level. This paper proposes an MMSEC-PIC receiver for MC-CDMA downlink in multicell environments.

For the Alamouti space-time block code, it allows the systems transmit diversity. The beamformer suppress interferences by beamspace processing called generalize sidelobe cancellation (GSC). By minimizing the output power of interference signals, the adaptive beamformer achieves an array pattern corresponding to the directions of arrival (DOAs) of desired user while steering null toward interfering users. Combined with space-time coding, the smart antenna forms multi-mainbeams toward the same desired user. The system performance is evaluated by simulation in terms of beampatterns and bit error rates (BERs).

Therefore such algorithms can perform suboptimally or even fail to produce the desired source separation when the assumed statistical model is inaccurate. We propose to use ICA using nonparametric likelihood ratio (NLR) criterion as a tuning element which will be added to minimum mean-square error (MMSE) based detector. This method is completely blind to the sources and have the ability to separate the mixed sources simultaneously.

While aliasing in the decimation stage causes subband energy spectra of deterministic signals to become shift-variant, imaging in the interpolation stage causes WSS random signals to become WS cyclostationary (WSCS). We provide criteria to quantify both shift variance and cyclic nonstationarity. For shift variance, these criteria separately assess the shift dependence of energy and of energy spectra. Similarly for nonstationarity, they separately assess the nonstationary behavior of signal power and of power spectra. We show that, under aliasing cancellation and perfect reconstruction constraints of paraunitary and biorthogonal filter banks, these criteria evaluate the behavior of deterministic and WSS random signals in a consistent, dual way.

Instead of searching the entire space, the proposed algorithm searches for the refined estimates in the subspaces near the initial estimate. Creation of initial guesses by using problem specific information and new specially tailored nonblind genetic operators, based on the ideas from schema theory, for realizing the proposed approach are described. The new genetic source symbol refinement (GSR) algorithm is tested to cope with rapidly varying finite-impulse response channels with additive noise model.

Parameter-tuning algorithms were constructed that systematically move the amplifier's operational point towards the bifurcation point, at which an infinite dc gain is achieved. In order to compensate for the PFA's high sensitivity to process and temperature variations, flexible analog design integrating digital programmability and adaptive digital postprocessing techniques were developed.

We present a mathematical framework to optimize the proposed decimation filters in such a way as to increase the SigmaDelta quantization noise (QN) rejection around the so called folding bands, frequency intervals whose QN gets folded down to baseband because of the decimation process. Comparisons are given in terms of passband drop and selectivity with respect to classic comb filters with orders ranging from 3 to 6. As far as the practical implementation of the proposed filters is concerned, we present two different architectures, namely a recursive and a nonrecursive implementation, the latter of which constitutes the basis for realizing multiplier-less generalized comb filter (GCF) realizations. We propose a mathematical framework for evaluating the sensitivity of GCFs to the approximation of the multipliers embedded in the filter architectures. The considerations deduced from the sensitivity analysis, pave the way to an optimization algorithm useful for approximating the multipliers with power-of-2 coefficients","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.895528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4195621/04195638.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1005","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.895528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Comb Decimation Filters for - A/D Converters: Analysis and Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Comb Decimation Filters for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> A/D Converters: Analysis and Design","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4195638/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9450322","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Comb Decimation Filters for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> A/D Converters: Analysis and Design","sourcePdf":"54tcsi05-laddomada.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064555S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4195621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4195621","articleId":"4195638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4195639,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Fa Lin","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4195621/4195639/4195639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Fa Lin was born in Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1971.

Compared with other low-gate-count full adder designs using pass transistor logic, the proposed design features lower operating voltage, higher computing speed and lower energy (power delay product) operation. The design adopts inverter buffered xor/xnor designs to alleviate the threshold voltage loss problem commonly encountered in pass transistor logic design. This problem usually prevents the full adder design from operating in low supply voltage or cascading directly without extra buffering. The proposed design successfully embeds the buffering circuit in the full adder design and the transistor count is minimized. The improved buffering helps the design operate under lower supply voltage compared with existing works. It also enhances the speed performance of the cascaded operation significantly while maintaining the performance edge in energy consumption. For performance comparison, both dc andperformances of the proposed design against various full adder designs are evaluated via extensive HSPICE simulations. The simulation results, based on TSMC 2P4M 0.35-mum process models, indicate that the proposed design has the lowest working V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n and highest working frequency among all designs using ten transistors.

However, there exist very few circuit configurations (like, for example, the current-mode-controlled dc-dc converters or current programmed H-bridge inverter) for which the map can be obtained in closed form. In this paper, we show that, in a voltage-mode-controlled dc-dc converter, if the switching is governed by pulse-width modulation of the first kind (PWM-1), an explicit form of the stroboscopic map can be obtained. The resulting discrete-time state space is piecewise smooth, divided into five regions, each with a different functional form. We then analyze the bifurcation behavior using the explicit map and demonstrate the different types of border collision bifurcations that may occur in this system as a fixed point moves from one region to another. This includes the very interesting case of a direct transition from periodicity to quasi-periodicity through the route of border collision bifurcation. Mode-locking periodic windows are also obtained at certain ranges of the parameters.

In this paper, we propose a low-cost signature test methodology for accelerated production testing of analog and RF integrated circuits. As opposed to prior work, the key contribution of this paper is a new test generation algorithm that directly tracks the ability of input test waveforms to predict the test specification values from the observed test response, even in the presence of measurement noise. The response of the device-under-test (DUT) is used as a \"signature\" from which all of the performance specifications are predicted. The applied test stimulus is optimized in such a way that the error between the measured DUT performances and the predicted DUT performances is minimized. While existing low-cost test approaches have only been applied to low- and medium-frequency analog circuits, the proposed methodology extends low-cost signature testing to RF integrated circuits by incorporating modulation of a baseband test stimulus and subsequent demodulation of the obtained response to obtain the DUT signature.

In support of this, an analysis of N-way power-combining networks is presented-in particular, their optimum design-by examining the relationship between the drive conditions of the active devices and input power. This analysis makes no prior assumption on the network topology and facilitates free-to-choose levels for the high-efficiency power back-off points. By comparing the results of this analysis with prior work, it is shown that very specific drive conditions apply to traditional three-way Doherty amplifier implementations to obtain simultaneously high-efficiency and high-linearity operation. To support these conclusions, a 15-W three-way Doherty amplifier was constructed using Philips GEN4 LDMOS devices featuring three separate inputs to independently drive the main and peaking devices. By testing this three-way amplifier with a custom-built measurement setup, capable of providing multiple digitally controlled coherent RF input signals with high spectral purity, a unique flexible amplifier concept is created resulting in a record-high efficiency for LDMOS-based Doherty amplifiers over a 12-dB back-off power range","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4195653/04195671.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.895160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.895160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed-Signal Approach Towards Linear and Efficient --Way Doherty Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Linearity","Broadband amplifiers","Testing","Radio frequency","Multiaccess communication","Power amplifiers","Network topology","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","MOS analogue integrated circuits","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed-signal approach","power-combining network","three-way Doherty amplifier","Philips GEN4 LDMOS devices","digitally controlled coherent RF input signals","base station","15 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analysis","base station","coherent signals","Doherty","high efficiency","high power","linearity","mixed signal","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed-Signal Approach Towards Linear and Efficient <formula> <tex>$N$</tex></formula>-Way Doherty Amplifiers","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4195671/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9447011","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed-Signal Approach Towards Linear and Efficient <formula> <tex>$N$</tex></formula>-Way Doherty Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tmtt05-neo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084681S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4195653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4195653","articleId":"4195671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4195675,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Kwon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4195653/4195675/4195675-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Kwon Park (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu.","For three months in 2006, he was an Intern with Lucent Technologies/Bell Laboratories.

One challenge for such detection in single channel receivers is demodulation sensitivity to target position, which can be overcome by using a quadrature receiver. This paper presents a mathematical analysis and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of arctangent demodulation in quadrature receivers. A particular challenge in this technique is the presence of dc offset resulting from receiver imperfections and clutter reflections, in addition to dc information related to target position and associated phase. These dc components can be large compared to the ac motion-related signal, and thus, cannot simply be included in digitization without adversely affecting resolution. Presented here is a method for calibrating the dc offset while preserving the dc information and capturing the motion-related signal with maximum resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that arctangent demodulation with dc offset compensation results in a significant improvement in heart rate measurement accuracy over quadrature channel selection, with a standard deviation of less than 1 beat/min","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.895653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.895653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4195653/04195675.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arctangent Demodulation With DC Offset Compensation in Quadrature Doppler Radar Receiver Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Arctangent Demodulation With DC Offset Compensation in Quadrature Doppler Radar Receiver Systems","volume":"55","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195675/","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9447034","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195675/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arctangent Demodulation With DC Offset Compensation in Quadrature Doppler Radar Receiver Systems","sourcePdf":"55tmtt05-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061226S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4195653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"347","xplore-issue":"4195653","articleId":"4195675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4195676,"authors":[{"name":"Ullrich R.

Generally speaking, methods invoking analytic pre-processing of the device's V-I relations (admittance or impedance) are computationally more efficient than methods employing a numerical procedure to iteratively process the device at each time step. For circuits providing complex functionality, two-port or possibly multiport devices whether passive or active, are sure to appear in the circuits. Therefore, extensions to currently available full-wave methods for handling one-port devices to process multiport devices would be useful for hybrid microwave circuit designs. In this paper, an efficient scheme for processing arbitrary multiport devices in the FDTD method is proposed. The device's admittance is analytically pre-processed and fitted into one grid cell. With an improved time-stepping expression, the computation efficiency is further increased. Multiport devices in the circuit can be systematically incorporated and analyzed in a full-wave manner. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparison with results from the equivalent current-source method and is numerically stable","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.895652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4195653/04195683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.895652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195653","startPage":"958","endPage":"965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Scheme for Processing Arbitrary Lumped Multiport Devices in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Scheme for Processing Arbitrary Lumped Multiport Devices in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9447021","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Scheme for Processing Arbitrary Lumped Multiport Devices in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"55tmtt05-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032947S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4195653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4195683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4195684,"authors":[{"name":"Young Yun Woo","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4195653/4195684/4195684-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young Yun Woo received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Han-Yang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Korea, in 2007.","In 2007, he joined the Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Suwon, Gyeunggi, Korea.

The lookup-table-based feedback input can remove the bandwidth limitation of the feedback circuit related to the loop delay, and suppress feedback oscillation by accurate digital control of the feedback signal. Moreover, the predistortion (PD) signal can be extracted very efficiently. By combining the feedback linearization and DPD linearization techniques, the performance of the predistorter is enhanced significantly compared to the conventional DPD. To clearly visualize the characteristics of digital FBPD (DFBPD), we have compared it to the conventional DPD based on the recursive least square algorithm using Matlab simulation. The results clearly show that the new method is a good linearization algorithm, better than a conventional DPD. For the demonstration, a Doherty power amplifier with 180-W peak envelope power is linearized using the proposed DFBPD.

Usually, the currents are filtered with low-pass filters to measure the average current value. However, these low-pass filters have the drawback of adding hardware design effort and causing a time delay of the current signal. Additionally, the switching actions in multi-phase DC/DC converters lead to EMI noise which results in further inaccuracies of the current measurement. Thus, an advanced average current sampling algorithm for multi-phase DC/DC converters with an odd number of phases is proposed which eliminates the disadvantages of low-pass filters and is immune to EMI noise. Furthermore, a novel predictive digital current control for bidirectional operation using the advanced current sampling algorithm is presented in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4195693/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Digital Current Control Using Advanced Average Current Sampling Algorithm for Multi-Phase 2-Quadrant DC/DC Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Digital Current Control Using Advanced Average Current Sampling Algorithm for Multi-Phase 2-Quadrant DC/DC Converters","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037809S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4195694,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the second, system-identification based method, compensator parameters are computed based on on-line identification of the power stage frequency response. The tuning techniques proposed in this paper have been specifically developed to handle wide capacitance and ESR range, and important extensions of the basic algorithms are implemented in order to face practical issues such as limit cycling conditions, output voltage tolerance specification, closed-loop bandwidth maximization and phase margin constraints.

A simplified direct-digital design approach is proposed where digital compensation tools are analyzed in the familiar analog frequency domain. The design is based on traditional concepts and tools such as Bode plots, zero/pole insertion, and gain/phase margins. In contrast to analog redesign methods, this approach is able to accurately account for loop parasitics such as zero-order holds and computational delays and predict the system response. It does not entail the creation of a discrete-time model of the controlled plant, necessary for other direct-digital design approaches. Families of compensation zeros/poles are presented. Notably powerful are two families of complex zero pairs, able to create a sharp phase boost of 180 degrees, specifically useful for converters with high-Q filters. A numbering system is introduced that enables simple -yet optimized-number representation within a fixed-point environment. This system is utilized to model different controller blocks, and to construct a blue-print of the controller code. A design example is then used to demonstrate the design methodology. Experimental results of a matching prototype are then presented that show close correspondence to theoretical and simulation predictions.","doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357493","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","startPage":"34","endPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital controller design for a practicing power electronics engineer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital controller design for a practicing power electronics engineer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4195697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital controller design for a practicing power electronics engineer","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047959S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195698,"authors":[{"name":"Zdravko Lukic","affiliation":["Laboratory for Power Management and Integrated SMPS, ECE Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zdravko","lastName":"Lukic","id":"37300752300"},{"name":"Christopher Blake","affiliation":["Laboratory for Power Management and Integrated SMPS, ECE Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Blake","id":"37300753400"},{"name":"Santa C.

A new three-dimensional (3D) power delivery approach along with a cellular power supply architecture is proposed as a possible solution to the problems of conventional 2D power delivery. Different 3D integration technologies or possible power-processor integration applications are reviewed, and important 3D design partitioning considerations are discussed. A fully monolithic, two-phase interleaved buck converter design having the potential to be used as a basic building block in a cellular architecture to meet steady-state and dynamic regulation requirements of future processors is presented. Each cell of the converter is designed for 500 mA rated output current, operates at 200 MHz switching frequency, and achieves a control bandwidth of about 10 MHz. Design trade-offs, implementation methods, and prototype results including chip area, loss breakdown, efficiency, as well as dynamic responses to load step changes are presented. Scaling-up of the design through parallel operation of a large number of such standard converter cells is discussed, and the benefits of interleaved operation in drastically reducing the input and output filter size are quantified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195709/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195709/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"3D Power Delivery for Microprocessors and High-Performance ASICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Power Delivery for Microprocessors and High-Performance ASICs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039464S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4195714,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Huber","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Delta Products Corporation, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Huber","id":"37389347300"},{"name":"Yungtaek Jang","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Delta Products Corporation, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yungtaek","lastName":"Jang","id":"37291203100"},{"name":"Milan M.

By virtue of the modular nature of the converter, it is possible to integrate multiple loads and sources to the converter at the same time. The modular construction of the MMCCC topology provides transformer like taps in the circuit, and depending on the conversion ratio of the converter, it becomes possible to connect several dc sources and loads at these taps. The modularity of the new converter is not limited to this transformer like operation, but also provides redundancy and fault bypass capability in the circuit. Using the modularity feature, some redundant modules can be operated in bypass state, and during any fault, these redundant modules can be used to replace a faulty module to maintain an uninterrupted operation. Thus, this MMCCC topology could be a solution to establish a power management system among multiple sources and loads having different operating voltages.","doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357539","startPage":"361","endPage":"367","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195743.pdf","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Load-Source Integration in a Multilevel Modular Capacitor Clamped DC-DC Converter Featuring Fault Tolerant Capability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Load-Source Integration in a Multilevel Modular Capacitor Clamped DC-DC Converter Featuring Fault Tolerant Capability","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195743/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195743/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Load-Source Integration in a Multilevel Modular Capacitor Clamped DC-DC Converter Featuring Fault Tolerant Capability","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056701S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4195744,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This converter combines the LLC topology, which maintains merits as ZVS for all primary side main switches and ZCS for secondary side diodes under wide range inputs, and the three-level technique, which is suitable for high voltage input applications, together. In addition, full bridge configuration endows the high power capability to the proposed converter. The detail operation principles, as well as the design considerations and loss calculation, were presented. The validity and applicability were also verified by a 1kW prototype, while the maximum efficiency reaches 96.2%. Therefore, the proposed converter is very attractive for the system integration applications which have requirement to be compatible with 400V and 800V PFC systems, while high power capability must be taken into account. Consequently, it is of practical significance for industry to simplify power supply's variety and lower cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195745/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4195745/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Three Level Full Bridge Resonant Dc-Dc Converter Suitable for High Power Wide Range Input Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Three Level Full Bridge Resonant Dc-Dc Converter Suitable for High Power Wide Range Input Applications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04526S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4195764,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Particular emphasis is given to polar and envelope-tracking RF power amplifier (PA) applications requiring wideband dynamic voltage regulation. Ideal expressions are derived for the optimum current contribution of the switching regulator under quasi-static operating conditions. In contrast to previous work, it is shown that the optimum mean current contribution of the switching regulator is not necessarily the DC current to the load, but is a function of the DC and dynamic characteristics of the regulated output voltage. Theoretical maximum efficiency is derived for envelope waveforms that result from two-tone and sinusoidal amplitude modulation of the RF carrier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195775/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195775/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Bias Calculation for Parallel Hybrid Switching-Linear Regulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Bias Calculation for Parallel Hybrid Switching-Linear Regulators","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-84.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103279S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195780,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Lee","affiliation":["Eaton Innovation Center, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281495500"},{"name":"Ian T.

This second order observer identifies the dc link current drawn by the output inverter section. The observed load current is then used as a feedforward signal to input converter current regulator section for improving its dynamic response. The new contributions include the analysis on the system observability, observer sensitivity to system parameters, its command tracking performance, dc link voltage and load current dynamic disturbance rejection capabilities, all of which are not found in present literatures. In conjunction with the dc link current observer analysis, the current regulator bandwidth performance of the input ac-dc converter stage is characterized for both single and double update pulse width modulation (PWM) methods. The high performance resides in its fast dynamic response to the load power requirements resulting in dc link voltage variation, without using dc link current sensor or any communication channels. The solution is not only ideal for a stand alone UPS or ASD for low cost and high dynamic performance, but is particularly attractive for ac-dc converters suitable for common dc link systems. The analytical results are verified through the state-of-the-art simulation.

A 5 kW grid-tie fuel cell power conditioning system (PCS) example is used in paper to show current loop controller design and admittance compensation technique. A second order lead-lag compensator is proposed to avoid low stability margin while maintaining sufficient gain at the fundamental frequency. The proposed current loop controller and admittance compensation have been simulated, and the same parameters have been used for a DSP-based PCS inverter controller. Simulation results indicate that without the admittance path compensation, the duty cycle of the current loop controller is largely offset by the admittance path. At light load settings, the power flow may be erratically fed back to the inverter that can cause dc bus over voltage and subsequently a catastrophe failure. With admittance path compensation and the designed lead-lag compensator, the output power shows a steady-state offset that coincidently is required by the fuel cell. Experimental results well matched the mathematical design and simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195788/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195788/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Current Loop Control with Admittance Compensation for a Single-Phase Grid-Tie Fuel Cell Power Conditioning System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Loop Control with Admittance Compensation for a Single-Phase Grid-Tie Fuel Cell Power Conditioning System","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103347S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195798,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhui Zhang","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281459600"},{"name":"Seth R.

In PV applications it is possible to remove the transformer in the inverter in order to reduce losses, costs and size. Galvanic connection of the grid and the DC sources in transformerless systems can introduce additional leakage currents due to the earth parasitic capacitance. This currents increase conducted and radiated electromagnetic emissions, harmonics injected in the utility grid and losses. Amplitude and spectrum of leakage current depends on the converter topology, on the switching strategy and on the resonant circuit formed by the ground capacitance, the converter, the AC filter and the grid. In this paper, the leakage current in a 1.5 kW PV installation is measured under different conditions and used to build simulation model. The installation includes a string of sixteen PV panel, a full bridge inverter and a LCL filter. This model allows studying the influence of the harmonics injected by the inverter on the leakage current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195827/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195827/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Leakage current evaluation of a singlephase transformerless PV inverter connected to the grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage current evaluation of a singlephase transformerless PV inverter connected to the grid","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051554S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4195836,"authors":[{"name":"Milan Ilic","affiliation":["Advanced Energy, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Ilic","id":"37302149000"},{"name":"Dragan Maksimovic","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department, University of Colorado Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Maksimovic","id":"37276047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0713-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1048-2334"}],"articleNumber":"4195836","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":571},"abstract":"This paper introduces a full bridge converter with reduced circulating current and a reduction of the switch conduction and turn-off losses achieved by an energy recovery secondary clamp circuit.

Compared to the previous research, the new control set has much less computational burden and offers more straightforward and robust capacitor voltage control for the hybrid (cascaded) inverter cell without dc sources. At the same time, it tracks the fast changing motor drive reference voltage magnitude and frequency instantaneously. Therefore, it is readily integrated into the motor drive controls with fast dynamics, such as direct torque control as used in this work. Several practical issues in its implementation, such as capacitor voltage ripple, capacitor precharging and initial stator flux buildup, are analyzed in detail.

Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357651","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1094","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195854.pdf","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM Method of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter under Neutral Point Imbalance Condition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"PWM Method of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter under Neutral Point Imbalance Condition","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195854/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195854/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM Method of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter under Neutral Point Imbalance Condition","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03309S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4195860,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is being used as the large-signal generator for an inductive load characterization test-bench which permits to obtain measurements in a real working situation over a wide frequency and output power operating conditions for a variety of loads. Square wave operation is established slightly above resonance under Zero Voltage Switching conditions to acquire near sinusoidal current and low losses. Output power is controlled by means of a variable DC bus and resonant conditions are fixed for each operating frequency by means of two adjustable resonant capacitor banks. The control of every test-bench block and the triggering waveform generation is performed digitally by means of a Field Programmable Gate Array. The modular approach and the flexible control implementation enable the utilization of several modules in parallel connection or full-bridge configuration widening the possibilities of load excitation.

These common mode currents are known to damage the bearings of electric machines and cause malfunctions in other surrounding electronic devices, and therefore need to be confined by using bulky and expensive electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) filters. The presented work focuses on the three levels neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter and proposes a new pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy for the reduction of common mode currents by lowering the number of step variations of the common mode voltage. Unlike previous strategies, this carrier-based PWM pays attention to the real phenomena involved in the generation of common mode currents so as to efficiently reduce them by avoiding dead time effects. The new strategy has been implemented in a 20 kVA prototype and the experimental results presented in this paper confirm its best EMC behavior compared with classical PWM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357671","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195874.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1230","doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Carrier-Based PWM for the Reduction of Common Mode Currents Applied to Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Carrier-Based PWM for the Reduction of Common Mode Currents Applied to Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4195874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195874/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Carrier-Based PWM for the Reduction of Common Mode Currents Applied to Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverters","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063014S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195885,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Considering that the load is disconnected from the source during part of the switching period, with DM control. A time-domain analysis method is proposed to obtain the analytical expression of the output power, the capacitor voltage and load current. The validity of the analytical expression is checked through simulation.

Due to the enormous progress recently achieved in the technology of light emitting diodes (LEDs) it can be expected that LEDs lighting will replace incandescent and halogen bulbs in general illumination in the near future. A LED light source typically consists of a series connection of single LED cells. It shows a similar behaviour like a zener diode. For efficiency reasons LED strings can not be supplied via series resistors but need switched mode power drivers with current control. Different standard DC-DC converter topologies are discussed which can be adapted to feed a constant current into a LED load. For future LED driver developments it has to be considered that LEDs can also efficiently be supplied by pulsating currents. This simplifies the converter and control design and reduces the number of components. Hence, different converter topologies are studied which are able to stabilise the average value of a pulsating output current. This also includes topologies with galvanic isolation. Resonant operating LED drivers seem to be specially suited for this task. Hence, a series resonant galvanic isolating LED driver is studied in detail. Under certain conditions this converter does not need a current sensor to stabilise the average current in the LED load. Finally, the features of different pulsating current waves are investigated concerning their peak, RMS and high frequency content.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1325","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power driver topologies and control schemes for LEDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4195889/","displayDocTitle":"Power driver topologies and control schemes for LEDs","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power driver topologies and control schemes for LEDs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059627S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"216","articleId":"4195889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4195918,"authors":[{"name":"Surin Khomfoi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Surin","lastName":"Khomfoi","id":"37301115200"},{"name":"Leon M.

TVC works in parallel with a voltage regulator (VR)'s ceramic cap to achieve a faster voltage regulation without huge bulk capacitor. Hence it acts as a replacement of the bulk cap. Due to the limited control bandwidth, traditional VR could not respond rapidly to the load transient. As a result, a large output voltage spike can occur during load transient hence requiring large amount of bulk cap to decouple the VR from the load. The specific function of TVC is to replace the bulk cap and sink or source large currents similar to the bulk cap. This will allow fast transient response without large bulk capacitor. The main challenge in applying the TVC is how to design the TVC that will not interfere with VR operation. In this paper, the total system output impedance, the TVC impedance concept, system control bandwidth and transient response are discussed. The theoretical analysis will be confirmed by the cadence simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Voltage","Clamps","Impedance","Virtual reality","Capacitors","Bandwidth","Transient response","Design methodology","Regulators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357737","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195940.pdf","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Transient Voltage Clamp (TVC) Based On Output Impedance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Transient Voltage Clamp (TVC) Based On Output Impedance Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195940/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195940/","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Transient Voltage Clamp (TVC) Based On Output Impedance Analysis","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041301S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4195944,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Kwasinski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Grainger Center for Electric Machinery and Electromechanics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511700"},{"name":"Philip T.

Most of these systems have an isolation transformer included, which if excluded from the system would increase the efficiency and decrease the size of PV installations, furthermore it would lead to a lower cost for the whole investment. But there are some safety issues regarding the missing galvanic isolation. This paper is aiming to analyze and compare the most common single-stage transformerless PV inverter topologies for single-phase and three-phase with respect to the leakage current generation. The best results, both for single-phase and three-phase systems, are obtained when the middle point of the input capacitors is connected to the neutral point, thereby minimizing the voltage fluctuations present at the terminals of the PV panel.","doi":"10.1109/APEX.2007.357753","publicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 07 - Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195690/4195691/04195956.pdf","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEX.2007.357753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4195691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters Connected to the Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4195956/","displayDocTitle":"Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters Connected to the Grid","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4195956/","conferenceDate":"25 Feb.-1 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters Connected to the Grid","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"APEX-00-265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041842S","chronDate":"Feb. 25 2007-March 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195690","isNumber":"4195691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195690","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4195691","articleId":"4195956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4195998,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Nieuwoudt","id":"37299372300"},{"name":"Tamer Ragheb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ragheb","id":"37299375200"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4195998","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195998","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Broadband amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Integrated circuit synthesis","Impedance matching","Analytical models","Coupling circuits","Wideband","Integrated circuit yield"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","impedance matching","low noise amplifiers","network synthesis","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical optimization","wideband low noise amplifiers","systematic synthesis","impedance matching","noise figure","convex optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357794","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04195998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Optimization Methodology for Wideband Low Noise Amplifiers","abstract":"In this paper, we present a systematic synthesis methodology for fully integrated wideband low noise amplifiers that simultaneously optimizes impedance matching, noise figure, and other performance parameters.

Our approach combines continuous and discrete optimization techniques. We utilize network flows, which incorporate the more realistic half-perimeter wire length objective, to facilitate module spreading in conjunction with a log-sum-exponential function based analytic approach. Our approach obtains wire length results that are competitive with the best known results, but with much lower run times.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Wire","White spaces","Iterative algorithms","Simulated annealing","Computer science","Integrated circuit synthesis","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","function approximation","integrated circuit design","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast analytic placement","minimum cost flow","integrated circuits designs","Vaastu placement tool","continuous optimization","discrete optimization","network flows","half-perimeter wire length","module spreading","log-sum-exponential function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196020","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357974","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357974","startPage":"128","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Analytic Placement using Minimum Cost Flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Analytic Placement using Minimum Cost Flow","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196020/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4196020/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562939","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Analytic Placement using Minimum Cost Flow","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056069S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4196021,"authors":[{"name":"Natarajan Viswanathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Natarajan","lastName":"Viswanathan","id":"37285288600"},{"name":"Min Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Pan","id":"37288179600"},{"name":"Chris Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Chu","id":"37277309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196021","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Large-scale systems","Timing","Scalability","Circuit synthesis","Routing","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","pattern clustering","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FastPlace 3.0","multilevel quadratic placement algorithm","placement congestion control","large-scale mixed-size designs","multilevel global placement framework","two-level clustering scheme","iterative local refinement","placement blockages","placement congestion constraints","legalization technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196021","abstract":"In this paper, we present FastPlace 3.0 - an efficient and scalable multilevel quadratic placement algorithm for large-scale mixed-size designs.

Hence, high-quality and fast global routers are in great demand. In this paper, we propose two major techniques to improve the extremely fast global router, FastRoute (Pan and Chu, 2006) in terms of solution quality : (1) monotonic routing, (2) multi-source multi-sink maze routing. The new router is called FastRoute 2.0. Experimental results show that FastRoute 2.0 can generate high-quality routing solutions with fast runtime compared with three state-of-the-art academic global routers FastRoute, Labyrinth (Kastner et al., 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (Hadsell and Madden, 2003). On the set of benchmarks used in Pan and Chu, 2006 and Hadsell and Madden (2003), the total overflow of FastRoute 2.0 is 98, compared to 1012 (FastRoute), 2846 (Labyrinth) and 1271 (Chi Dispersion Router). The runtime of FastRoute 2.0 is 73% slower than FastRoute, but 78times and 37times faster than Labyrinth and Chi Dispersion router. The promising results make it possible to integrate global routing into early design stages. This could dramatically improve the design solution quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FastRoute 2.0: A High-quality and Efficient Global Router","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196040.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"FastRoute 2.0: A High-quality and Efficient Global Router","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4196040/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9518993","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FastRoute 2.0: A High-quality and Efficient Global Router","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078748S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4196041,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Cao","affiliation":["Computer Science & Technology Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Cao","id":"37289588400"},{"name":"Tong Jing","affiliation":["Computer Science & Technology Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Jing","id":"37265853400"},{"name":"Jinjun Xiong","affiliation":["IBM Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37276003700"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277450900"},{"name":"Lei He","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"He","id":"37269852200"},{"name":"Xianlong Hong","affiliation":["Computer Science & Technology Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xianlong","lastName":"Hong","id":"37275521800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196041","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Heuristic algorithms","Wire","Runtime","Space exploration","Integrated circuit synthesis","Educational programs","Computer science","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DpRouter","global routing algorithm","dynamic pattern routing","segment movement technique","routing quality","FPGA routing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a fast and accurate global routing algorithm, DpRouter, based on two efficient techniques: (1) dynamic pattern routing (Dpr), and (2) segment movement.

And the PC representation of non-Gaussian variables gains more accuracy than Taylor representation used in previous work (Wang et al., 2004).","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196059.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"372","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Implementation of Stochastic Parameterized Model Order Reduction via Hermite Polynomial Chaos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Practical Implementation of Stochastic Parameterized Model Order Reduction via Hermite Polynomial Chaos","htmlLink":"/document/4196059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9519011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Implementation of Stochastic Parameterized Model Order Reduction via Hermite Polynomial Chaos","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047652S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4196060,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Nieuwoudt","id":"37299372300"},{"name":"Mehboob Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehboob","lastName":"Alam","id":"37291581400"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196060","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Spline","Interpolation","Polynomials","Least squares approximation","Power system interconnection","Transfer functions","Frequency response","Power system modeling","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","frequency response","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit modelling","interpolation","polynomial approximation","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-order wide-band interconnect model realization","filter-based spline interpolation","sampled interconnect frequency response data","piecewise polynomial interpolation","global polynomial fitting","higher order systems","data point pruning algorithm","model order reduction","balanced truncation","global polynomial approximation","model complexity"]}],"abstract":"In the paper, we develop a systematic methodology for modeling sampled interconnect frequency response data based on spline interpolation.

This provides significant advantages in synthesis by reducing circuit size and provides additional flexibility in technology mapping, which could be crucial in post-synthesis optimizations. Furthermore, it is also critical in verification because it can reduce the complexity of the netlist to be analyzed in equivalence checking. Most algorithms available so far for this goal do not exploit observability don't cares (ODCs) for node merging since nodes equivalent up to ODCs do not form an equivalence relation. Although a few recently proposed solutions can exploit ODCs by overcoming this limitation, they constrain their analysis to just a few levels of surrounding logic to avoid prohibitive runtime. We develop an ODC-based node merging algorithm that performs efficient global ODC analysis (considering the entire netlist) through simulation and SAT. Our contributions which enable global ODC-based optimizations are: (1) a fast ODC-aware simulator and (2) an incremental verification strategy that limits computational complexity. In addition, our technique operates on arbitrarily mapped netlists, allowing for powerful post-synthesis optimizations. We show that global ODC analysis discovers on average 25% more (and up to 60%) node-merging opportunities than current state-of-the-art solutions based on local ODC analysis.","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196067.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node Mergers in the Presence of Don't Cares","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Node Mergers in the Presence of Don't Cares","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562964","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196067/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Mergers in the Presence of Don't Cares","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067825S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4196077,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tao","id":"37399182100"},{"name":"Xuan Zeng","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37272246100"},{"name":"Wei Cai","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Cai","id":"37276544700"},{"name":"Yangfeng Su","affiliation":["Mathematics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yangfeng","lastName":"Su","id":"37290287300"},{"name":"Dian Zhou","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA","ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37277316800"},{"name":"Charles Chiang","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Group, Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37277663100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196077","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Steady-state","Algorithm design and analysis","Nonlinear systems","Circuits","Frequency","Chaos","Convergence","Fourier series","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","nonlinear network analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic sparse grid collocation algorithm","SSCA","periodic steady state analysis","nonlinear system","process variations","stochastic collocation algorithm","moment matching","parameterized model order reduction","PMOR","Taylor approximation","homogeneous chaos"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358031","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196077.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Sparse-grid Collocation Algorithm (SSCA) for Periodic Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear System with Process Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196077","abstract":"In this paper, stochastic collocation algorithm combined with sparse grid technique (SSCA) is proposed to deal with the periodic steady-state analysis for nonlinear systems with process variations. Compared to the existing approaches, SSCA has several considerable merits. Firstly, compared with the moment-matching parameterized model order reduction (PMOR), which equally treats the circuit response on process variables and frequency parameter by Taylor approximation, SSCA employs homogeneous chaos to capture the impact of process variations with exponential convergence rate and adopts Fourier series or wavelet bases to model the steady-state behavior in time domain. Secondly, contrary to stochastic Galerkin algorithm (SGA), which is efficient for stochastic linear system analysis, the complexity of SSCA is much smaller than that of SGA for nonlinear case. Thirdly, different from efficient collocation method, the heuristic approach which may results in \"rank deficient problem\" and \"Runge phenomenon\", sparse grid technique is developed to select the collocation points in SSCA in order to reduce the complexity while guaranteing the approximation accuracy. Furthermore, though SSCA is proposed for the stochastic nonlinear steady-state analysis, it can be applied for any other kinds of nonlinear system simulation with process variations, such as transient analysis, etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9562970","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196077/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Sparse-grid Collocation Algorithm (SSCA) for Periodic Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear System with Process Variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Sparse-grid Collocation Algorithm (SSCA) for Periodic Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear System with Process Variations","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067361S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4196085,"authors":[{"name":"Yazhuo Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yazhuo","lastName":"Dong","id":"37291358400"},{"name":"Yong Dou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Dou","id":"37285984800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196085","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High level synthesis","Image processing","Read-write memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Discrete Fourier transforms","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","image processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameterized architecture","high level synthesis","image processing applications","reconfigurable hardware boards"]}],"abstract":"Most image processing applications are computationally intensive and data intensive.

While optimizing tabular data, significant fitting efforts are required to fit the data into convex form. Fitting the tables into analytically convex forms like posynomials, suffers from excessive fitting errors, as the fitting problem may be non-convex. In recent literature optimal numerically convex tables have been proposed. Since these tables are numerical, it is extremely important to make the table data smooth, and yet preserve its convexity. The smoothness ensures that the convex optimizer behaves predictably and converges quickly to the global optimal point. The existing smoothing techniques either cannot preserve convexity, or require very high execution time. In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm to smoothen a given numerically convex data and at the same time preserve convexity. Our proposed algorithm SmartSmooth can smoothen the data in linear time without introducing any additional error on the numerically convex data. We present our SmartSmooth results on industrial cell libraries. SmartSmooth when applied on convex tables produced by ConvexFit shows a 30times reduction in fitting square error over a posynomial fitting algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358045","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","startPage":"559","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SmartSmooth: A linear time convexity preserving smoothing algorithm for numerically convex data with application to VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SmartSmooth: A linear time convexity preserving smoothing algorithm for numerically convex data with application to VLSI design","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196091/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562979","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SmartSmooth: A linear time convexity preserving smoothing algorithm for numerically convex data with application to VLSI design","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085112S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4196095,"authors":[{"name":"Zahid Khan","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Zahid","lastName":"Khan","id":"37301848200"},{"name":"Tughrul Arslan","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tughrul","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37273392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196095","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Real time systems","Code standards","Throughput","Forward error correction","Error correction","Decoding","Computer architecture","Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","logic design","parity check codes","programmable circuits","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time programmable encoder","low density parity check code","reconfigurable instruction cell architecture","IEEE P802.16E/D7 standard","H matrix","ANSI-C programmable embedded core"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a real time programmable irregular low density parity check (LDPC) encoder as specified in the IEEE P802.16E/D7 standard.

Due to their excellent performance turbo codes have been employed in several transmission systems such as CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), ADSL, IEEE 802.16 metropolitan networks etc. The computation kernel of the algorithm is very similar and we have exploited this commonality for a turbo decoder VLSI design suitable for deployment using platform based system on chip methodologies. Turbo and Viterbi components of the unified array are also individually reconfigurable for different standards. This supports the 4G concept that user can be simultaneously connected to several access technologies (for example Wi-Fi, 3G, GSM etc.) and can seamlessly move between them. A new normalization scheme for turbo decoding is presented to suit reconfigurable mappings. We have also shown dynamic reconfiguration methodology for a context switch between turbo and Viterbi decoders which does not waste any clock cycles. The reconfigurable turbo decoder fabric is implemented reusing components of Viterbi decoder on a 180 nm UMC process technology.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358050","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","startPage":"589","endPage":"594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Design of Multi Standard Turbo Decoder for 3G and Beyond","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Design of Multi Standard Turbo Decoder for 3G and Beyond","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196096/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562983","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Design of Multi Standard Turbo Decoder for 3G and Beyond","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112575S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4196097,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37290328300"},{"name":"Chih-Tsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Tsun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281272400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196097","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","CMOS technology","Application software","Throughput","Hardware","Table lookup","Data security","Inverters","Pipelines","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","design for testability","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power AES cipher","network applications","two-stage pipeline","CCM mode","design-for-test circuitry","CMOS technology","4.27 Gbits/s","333 MHz","40.9 mW","0.13 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358051","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196097.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Throughput Low-Power AES Cipher for Network Applications","abstract":"We propose a full-featured high-throughput low-power AES cipher which is suitable for widespread network applications.

Many high-level synthesis techniques have been developed to find optimal prefix structures for specific applications. However, the gap between these techniques and back-end designs is increasingly large. In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming method to build minimal-power prefix adders within given timing and area constraints. It counts both gate and wire capacitances in the timing and power models, considers static and dynamic power consumptions, and can handle gate sizing and buffer insertion to improve the performance further. The proposed method is also adaptive for non-uniform arrival time and required time on each bit position. Therefore our method produces the optimum prefix adder for realistic constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358053","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196099.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Prefix Adders in a Comprehensive Area, Timing and Power Design Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Prefix Adders in a Comprehensive Area, Timing and Power Design Space","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196099/","accessionNumber":"9518982","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Prefix Adders in a Comprehensive Area, Timing and Power Design Space","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088732S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4196101,"authors":[{"name":"Cheoljoo Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cheoljoo","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37268287800"},{"name":"Steven M.

One attractive alternative is to use robust asynchronous circuits which gracefully accommodate timing discrepancies. However, these asynchronous circuits typically suffer from high area and latency overhead. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is presented which reduces the area and delay of these circuits by relaxing their overly-restrictive style. The algorithm was implemented and experiments performed on a subset of MCNC circuits. On average, 49.2% of the gates could be implemented in a relaxed manner, 34.9% area improvement was achieved, and 16.1% delay improvement was achieved using a simple heuristic for targeting the critical path in the circuit. This is the first proposed approach that systematically optimizes asynchronous circuits based on the notion of local relaxation while still preserving the circuit's overall timing-robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196101/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4196101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562984","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Robust Asynchronous Circuits by Local Input Completeness Relaxation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Robust Asynchronous Circuits by Local Input Completeness Relaxation","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056539S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4196111,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Hassan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37269532000"},{"name":"Mohab Anis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohab","lastName":"Anis","id":"37281708400"},{"name":"Mohamed Elmasry","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elmasry","id":"37276008000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196111","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuits","Delay","Logic","Performance loss","Subthreshold current","Timing","CMOS technology","Sociotechnical systems","Sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","CMOS digital integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","leakage currents","nanotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing-driven algorithm","MTCMOS FPGA","MTCMOS CAD methodology","subthreshold leakage power reduction","nanometer FPGA","circuit timing information","CMOS process","0.13 micron"]}],"abstract":"A timing-driven MTCMOS (T-MTCMOS) CAD methodology is proposed for subthreshold leakage power reduction in nanometer FPGAs.

Also, 3D IC technology can be used to realize heterogeneous system-on-chip design, by integrating different modules together with less interference with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel thermal-aware 3D cell placement approach, named T3Place, based on transforming a 2D placement with good wirelength to a 3D placement, with the objectives of half-perimeter wirelength, through-the-silicon (TS) via number and temperature. T3Place is composed of two steps, transformation from a 2D placement to a 3D placement and the refinement of the resulting 3D placement. We proposed and compared several different transformation techniques, including local stacking transformation (LST), folding-2, folding-4 and window-based stacking/folding transformation, and concluded that (i) LST can generate 3D placements with the least wirelength, (ii) the folding-based transformations result in 3D placements with the fewest TS vias, and (iii) the window-based stacking/folding transformations provide good TS via number and wirelength tradeoffs. For example, with four device layers, LST can reduce the wirelength by over 2times compared to the initial 2D placement, while window-based stacking/folding can provide over 10times variation in terms of the TS via number, thus adaptive to different manufacturing ability for TS via density. Moreover, we proposed a novel relaxed conflict-net (RCN) graph-based layer assignment method to further refine the 3D placements. Compared to LST results, thermal-aware RCN graph-based layer assignment algorithm (r = 10%) can further reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 37%, with only 6% TS via number increase and 8% wirelength increase.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358084","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358084","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196130.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Aware 3D IC Placement Via Transformation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Aware 3D IC Placement Via Transformation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9563000","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4196130/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-Aware 3D IC Placement Via Transformation","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065396S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4196146,"authors":[{"name":"Maziar Goudarzi","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Maziar","lastName":"Goudarzi","id":"37284237300"},{"name":"Tohru Ishihara","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tohru","lastName":"Ishihara","id":"37292362000"},{"name":"Hiroto Yasuura","affiliation":["System LSI Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroto","lastName":"Yasuura","id":"37299568300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0630-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4196146","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Threshold voltage","Circuits","Temperature","Redundancy","Runtime","Performance analysis","Degradation","Large scale integration","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integrated circuit yield","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software technique","processor chips","ultra-leaky SRAM cells","process variation","software-based runtime technique","cache lines"]}],"abstract":"Exceptionally leaky transistors are increasingly more frequent in nano-scale technologies due to lower threshold voltage and its increased variation. Such leaky transistors may even change position with changes in the operating voltage and temperature, and hence, redundancy at circuit-level is not sufficient to tolerate such threats to yield. We show that in SRAM cells this leakage depends on the cell value and propose a first software-based runtime technique that suppresses such abnormal leakages by storing safe values in the corresponding cache lines before going to standby mode. Analysis shows the performance penalty is, in the worst case, linearly dependent to the number of so-cured cache lines while the energy saving linearly increases by the time spent in standby mode. Analysis and experimental results on commercial processors confirm that the technique is viable if the standby duration is more than a small fraction of a second.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Software Technique to Improve Yield of Processor Chips in Presence of Ultra-Leaky SRAM Cells Caused by Process Variation","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358100","startPage":"878","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144549","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4195969/4144549/04196146.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Software Technique to Improve Yield of Processor Chips in Presence of Ultra-Leaky SRAM Cells Caused by Process Variation","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4196146/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9563011","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Software Technique to Improve Yield of Processor Chips in Presence of Ultra-Leaky SRAM Cells Caused by Process Variation","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"ASPDAC-00-177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051484S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4195969","isNumber":"4144549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195969","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4144549","articleId":"4196146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4196157,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Hui Chang","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kai-Hui","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292347600"},{"name":"Igor L.

The average bit error rate (BER) expression for uniform multipath power profile is derived when the number of receive antennas is greater than that of transmit antennas.

Firstly dominant trapping sets (TSs), accounting for most of FER in high SNR region, are picked out as decoding result, with input of decoder consisting of a group of biased bits. And how those biased bits are chosen is reduced to finding solution to an binary integer program. Then decoder termination conditions are slightly modified so that history of the tentative decoding could facilitate action of searching for dominant TSs effectively. Without no prior knowledge of shape of error regions for specific LDPC code, we implement weighted mean translation (MT) of importance sampling (IS) method to compute FER in high SNR region.

The neural network model is based on an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process in which the AR part of the neural network defines the image model and its coefficients, while the MA part defines the degradation process. Since the blur affects textured region and smooth regions differently the image is divided into blocks, which have been categorized into four classes according to their activity. Furthermore it is assumed that blur is space-invariant in each block. This classification enhances the texture of relatively textured regions while suppressing the noise in relatively smoother backgrounds. A new cost function motivated by the human visual perception system is also proposed for the neural network. This comprises of two new terms for matching the second order local statistics of each block in order to improve the visual quality of the restored image. Improvement in signal to noise ratio (ISNR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the estimated blur have been used as figures of merit.

Path planning in a given environment, being a NP-hard problem, is computationally demanding especially if exact or deterministic techniques are employed. This paves the way for the use of evolutionary computing techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), for the solution of this problem. However as GAs tend to find optimal paths without considering the location and distribution of obstacles in the given map, therefore a large amount of time may be spent before even a feasible path is found. The technique conferred in this paper overcomes this shortcoming by using specialized morphological preprocessing techniques applied on the landscape representative image.

We propose a novel, area-speed efficient, high-speed architecture for the Advanced Encryption Standard hardware implementation. Our proposed architecture utilizes the composite field technique for SubBytes/InvSubBytes transformation instead of the traditionally-used look up table technique. As a result, the unbreakable delay of using look up tables in the traditional technique is eliminated. This, in turn, enables sub-pipelining implementation for further speeding up. Moreover, composite field arithmetic is employed to reduce the critical path delay. We propose a new algorithm to generate the optimum isomorphic mapping matrix, which reduces the critical path delay dramatically. In addition, an efficient key expansion architecture suitable for real-time applications is presented. Using the proposed architecture, a fully sub-pipelined implementation with 6 sub-stages in each round can achieve a throughput of 49.401 Gbps on a Xilinx XC2V6000FF1152-6 device in non-feedback mode, which is twice faster than the fastest Advanced Encryption Standard FPGA implementation known to date.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Speed, Fully-Pipelined VLSI Architecture for Real-Time AES","doi":"10.1109/ITICT.2006.358286","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITICT.2006.358286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4196464","publicationTitle":"2006 ITI 4th International Conference on Information & Communications Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 ITI 4th International Conference on Information & Communications Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4196463/4196464/04196510.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4196510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4196510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A High-Speed, Fully-Pipelined VLSI Architecture for Real-Time AES","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4196510/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703298","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Speed, Fully-Pipelined VLSI Architecture for Real-Time AES","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"ITICT-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035801S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4196463","isNumber":"4196464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4196463","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4196464","articleId":"4196510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4196538,"authors":[{"name":"Julia Handl","affiliation":["School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/4196525/4196538/4196538-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julia Handl received the BSc (Hons) degree in computer science in 2001 from Monash University, Australia, the MSc degree in computer science in 2003 from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, and the PhD degree in 2006 from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom.

In particular, we claim the need for visibility of context data about the IEEE 802.11 performance anomaly, i.e., the situation where even a single node located at the borders of the coverage area of a Wi-Fi access point produces a relevant degradation in the connectivity quality of all other nodes in the area. The paper proposes a novel application-level middleware that counteracts IEEE 802.11 anomaly without imposing any modification in standard Wi-Fi protocols, thus permitting to maintain the current wide base of installed equipment. Our middleware portably detects anomaly situations via decentralized standard mechanisms available at clients; anomaly awareness is used to promptly react with application-level management operations (flow quality downscaling and traffic shaping) that both preserve the goodput at nodes in well-covered areas and minimize quality degradations at clients generating the anomaly. The reported experimental results point out the feasibility of application-level middleware approaches also in the challenging multimedia area.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2007.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197231","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197230/4197231/04197242.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Aware Multimedia Middleware Solutions for Counteracting IEEE 802.11 Performance Anomaly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4197242/","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Multimedia Middleware Solutions for Counteracting IEEE 802.11 Performance Anomaly","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9824121","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Aware Multimedia Middleware Solutions for Counteracting IEEE 802.11 Performance Anomaly","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"27770009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042522S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4197230","isNumber":"4197231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4197230","xplore-issue":"4197231","articleId":"4197242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4197363,"authors":[{"name":"Sungchan Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, KR"],"firstName":"Sungchan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293202800"},{"name":"Hong Jeong","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37276640000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2777-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4197363","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time Stereo Vision FPGA Chip with Low Error Rate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Field programmable gate arrays","Error analysis","Very large scale integration","Systolic arrays","Videoconference","Virtual reality","Computational complexity","Dynamic programming","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error analysis","field programmable gate arrays","image matching","image resolution","microprocessor chips","real-time systems","stereo image processing","visual perception","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time stereo vision FPGA chip","field programmable gate arrays","low error rate","VLSI architecture","stereo matching algorithm","linear systolic array","simple processing element","time complexity"]}],"abstract":"As a step towards real-time stereo, we will present a fast and efficient VLSI architecture and implementation of a stereo matching algorithm which has a low error rate.

In this paper, the optimal multi-objective optimization based on PSO (OMOPSO) is presented. Since the parameters determines the performance of the algorithm, the uniform design is introduced to obtain the optimal combination of the parameters. Additionally, a new crowding operator is used to improve the distribution of nondominated solutions, and epsiv-dominance is used to fix the size of the set of final solutions. OMOPSO is also applied to optimize the indices of blind color image fusion. First the model of blind color image fusion in YUV color space is established, and then the proper evaluation indices without the reference image are given, in which a new indices of conditional mutual information is proposed. Experimental results indicate that OMOPSO has better exploratory capabilities, and that the approach to blind color image fusion realizes the Pareto optimal blind color image fusion.","doi":"10.1109/MUE.2007.204","startPage":"970","endPage":"975","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2007.204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197231","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197230/4197231/04197401.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Optimal Multi-objective Optimization Using PSO in Blind Color Image Fusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197401/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Optimal Multi-objective Optimization Using PSO in Blind Color Image Fusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4197401/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9859784","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Optimal Multi-objective Optimization Using PSO in Blind Color Image Fusion","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"27770970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054579S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4197230","isNumber":"4197231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4197230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4197231","articleId":"4197401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4197426,"authors":[{"name":"Hengfu Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hengfu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291236300"},{"name":"Xingming Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xingming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290262300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2777-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4197426","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197426","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Authentication","Humans","Discrete wavelet transforms","Entropy","Eyes","Robustness","Visual system","Image coding","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image-adaptive semi-fragile watermarking technique","image authentication","tamper detection","HVS model","human visual system","just noticeable differences threshold matrix","discrete wavelet transform","nonmalicious image operations"]}],"abstract":"By taking full advantage of the masking characteristics of the HVS (human visual system), this paper first deduces a JND (just noticeable differences) threshold matrix based on blocks, and then presents an image-adaptive semi-fragile watermarking technique operating in DWT (discrete wavelet transform) domain. The proposed technique embeds the watermark by modifying coefficients of the vertical and the horizontal detail subbands of image sub-blocks. The embedded watermark is invisible to human eyes and adaptive to the original image characteristics because of the utilization of HVS characteristics. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can distinguish adoptively some non-malicious image operations such as compression from malicious ones made on the watermarked image. The embedded watermark is sensitive to malicious attacks while robust to non-malicious attacks. Moreover, the scheme has a good accuracy in detecting and locating tampered blocks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2007.189","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197230/4197231/04197426.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1117","doi":"10.1109/MUE.2007.189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Image Authentication and Tamper Detection Using HVS Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Image Authentication and Tamper Detection Using HVS Model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4197426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9824180","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197426/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Image Authentication and Tamper Detection Using HVS Model","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"27771112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037995S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4197230","isNumber":"4197231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4197230","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4197231","articleId":"4197426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4197491,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Li","affiliation":["ENSTA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37293181200"},{"name":"Omar Hammami","affiliation":["ENSTA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Hammami","id":"37266047500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0777-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"4197491","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Space exploration","Principal component analysis","System-on-a-chip","Power system interconnection","Network topology","Energy consumption","Design methodology","Hardware","Emulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","network-on-chip","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NOCDEX","network-on-chip design space exploration","direct execution","options selection","principal component analysis","system-on-chip","interconnection topology","architecture parameters","hardware emulation","fast performance evaluation","actual post synthesis","actual optimal implementation frequency","execution time","statistical tool","productivity gains","cross-layer analysis"]}],"abstract":"The design of system on chip (SoC) is getting more and more complex.

This architecture can be applied to any multi layer neural network composed of a given number of layers and a given number of neurons in each layer. In addition this architecture enhances the density of the FPGA by supporting the two concepts of time multiplexing and partial dynamic reconfiguration. Several networks with different sizes were implemented based on this generic architecture. Based on those implementations, we'll analyse the performances of a virtex-4 via a multi layer neural network by analyzing the variation of the minimum period and the number of occupied resources.

Sleep transistor and source line self bias are added to the array, and their layouts fit to the repetitive cell placement. The area overhead is minimized in such a way that the footprint remains the same. A 0.18 mum 512 Kb test chip manufactured by two different foundries is used to demonstrate its effectiveness. The standby current measurements show substantial savings of 69% and 77%, respectively, at 1.8 V. The savings can be greater if the supply voltage is lowered. This encourages sleeping at low voltage. Design choices to vary the virtual ground voltage to attain further reduction are investigated. The tradeoff is with the data retention voltage which is measured at least 0.1 V higher. The fact that the cell stability is undermined in the sleep mode is the main concern to operate the SRAM at low voltage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standby Current Reduction of Compilable SRAM Using Sleep Transistor and Source Line Self Bias","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357842","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197566","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197565/4197566/04197581.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Standby Current Reduction of Compilable SRAM Using Sleep Transistor and Source Line Self Bias","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4197581/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9668036","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standby Current Reduction of Compilable SRAM Using Sleep Transistor and Source Line Self Bias","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ASSCC-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046333S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4197565","isNumber":"4197566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4197565","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4197566","articleId":"4197581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4197583,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Nezuka","affiliation":["Thin Film Electronics AB, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nezuka","id":"37294386700"},{"name":"Katsuhiko Misawa","affiliation":["Thin Film Electronics AB, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiko","lastName":"Misawa","id":"37285212600"},{"name":"Junichiro Azami","affiliation":["Thin Film Electronics AB, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichiro","lastName":"Azami","id":"37294380900"},{"name":"Yusuke Majima","affiliation":["Thin Film Electronics AB, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Majima","id":"37294384200"},{"name":"Jun-ichi Okamura","affiliation":["Thin Film Electronics AB, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ichi","lastName":"Okamura","id":"37294382400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9734-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4197583","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":611},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Circuits","Differential amplifiers","CMOS process","Dynamic range","Voltage","Operational amplifiers","Capacitors","Gain control","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","buffer circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","high-speed integrated circuits","signal processing equipment","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline A/D converter","high-speed video signal digitizer","ADC fabrication","digital programmable gain control","optimized reference voltage buffer","high-speed A/D conversion","CMOS process","power consumption","INL value","DNL value","SNR value","SFDR value","size 0.18 mum","power 128 mW","word length 10 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197583","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197566","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197565/4197566/04197583.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10-bit 200MS/s Pipeline A/D Converter for High-Speed Video Signal Digitizer","abstract":"A 10-bit 200MS/s A/D converter (ADC) for highspeed video signal digitizer is presented.

We propose a new structure of a complex bandpass filter in forward path with I, Q dynamic matching which is equivalent to the conventional one but it can be divided into two separate parts. As a result, the DeltaSigma modulator which constituted with our proposed complex filter can be completely divided into two separate parts too, and there are not any signal line crossing between the upper and lower paths by a complex filter and feedback from DACs. Therefore, the layout design of the modulator can be greatly simplified. Nine-level two quantizers and four DACs are used in the modulator for lower power implementation and higher SNDR, but the nonlinearities of DACs are not noise-shaped and the SNDR of the DeltaSigma ADC degrades. We have employed a new complex bandpass data-weighted averaging (DWA) algorithm to suppress nonlinearity effects of multibit DACs in complex form to achieve high accuracy; it can be realized just by adding simple digital circuitry. Implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process and at 2.8 V supply, the modulator achieves a measured peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion (SNDR) of 64.5 dB at 20 MS/s with a signal bandwidth of 78 kHz while dissipating 28.4 mW and occupying a chip area of 1.82 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357850","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4197565/4197566/04197589.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357850","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","startPage":"55","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multibit Complex Bandpass AZAD Modulator with I, Q Dynamic Matching and DWA Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Multibit Complex Bandpass AZAD Modulator with I, Q Dynamic Matching and DWA Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197589/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4197589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9667950","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multibit Complex Bandpass AZAD Modulator with I, Q Dynamic Matching and DWA Algorithm","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ASSCC-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116325S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4197565","isNumber":"4197566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4197565","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4197566","articleId":"4197589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4197593,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Koutani","affiliation":["Sharp Corporation, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Koutani","id":"37300211000"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawamura","affiliation":["Sharp Corporation, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37265357300"},{"name":"Shinji Toyoyama","affiliation":["Sharp Corporation, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Toyoyama","id":"37300211700"},{"name":"Kunihiko Iizuka","affiliation":["Sharp Corporation, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Kunihiko","lastName":"Iizuka","id":"37300209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9734-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4197593","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital control","Low-noise amplifiers","Linearity","Noise measurement","Digital video broadcasting","Energy consumption","Detectors","Attenuators","Circuit noise","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attenuators","BiCMOS digital integrated circuits","digital control","integrated circuit design","low noise amplifiers","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digitally controlled variable-gain low-noise amplifier","capacitive step attenuators","fabricated VGLNA design","digitally controlled current splitting technique","cascode transistors","BiCMOS process","power consumption","gain 25.8 dB to 21.2 dB","power 15.4 mW","frequency 650 MHz","voltage 2.9 V","size 0.5 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197593","abstract":"A variable-gain low-noise amplifier with capacitive step attenuators is presented.

In order to solve this issue, adaptive self refresh(ASR) scheme has been developed. A dual period based refresh is performed in the ASR scheme to reduce power dissipation using row register information. The row register information is adaptively modified according to the cell data retention characteristics. When DRAM enters self refresh mode, only the rows which were activated for write are tested using internal refresh test circuits. The test results are used to choose the appropriate period for the dual period base self refresh operation. This paper demonstrates 512M mobile SDRAM utilizing this adaptive self refresh(ASR) capability to minimize standby power to 150 uA @85degC while maintaining chip area of the conventional scheme using the same process technology.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2006.357915","startPage":"319","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Asian Solid-State

To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band (non-hopping mode), one must allocate quiet times, that is, periodically interrupt data transmission that could impair the QoS of WRAN. This critical issue can be addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in 802.22 called dynamic frequency hopping (DFH), where WRAN data transmission is performed in parallel with spectrum sensing without interruptions. DFH community, as described in this article, is a mechanism that coordinates multiple WRAN cells operating in the DFH mode, such that efficient frequency usage and reliable channel sensing are achieved. The key idea of DFH community is that neighboring WRAN cells form cooperating communities that coordinate their DFH operations","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COGNITIVE RADIOS FOR DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS - Dynamic Frequency Hopping Communities for Efficient IEEE 802.22 Operation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2007.358853","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4197701/04197719.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2007.358853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4197701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4197719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4197719/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"COGNITIVE RADIOS FOR DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS - Dynamic Frequency Hopping Communities for Efficient IEEE 802.22 Operation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4197719/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9469330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COGNITIVE RADIOS FOR DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS - Dynamic Frequency Hopping Communities for Efficient IEEE 802.22 Operation","sourcePdf":"HU.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040894S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4197701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4197701","articleId":"4197719","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4197720,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Ji","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"bio":{"p":["Zhu Ji (zhuji@umd.edu) received a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in May 2007.

As a cost-effective solution, multihop communication is becoming more and more important to WiMAX systems. To successfully deploy multihop WiMAX networks, security is one of the major challenges that must be addressed. Another crucial issue is how to support different services and applications in WiMAX networks. Since WiMAX is a relatively new standard, very little work has been presented in the literature. In this article we propose a secure and service-oriented network control framework for WiMAX networks. In the design of this framework we consider both the security requirements of the communications and the requirements of potential WiMAX applications that have not been fully addressed previously in the network layer design. The proposed framework consists of two basic components: a service-aware control framework and a unified routing scheme. Besides the design of the framework, we further study a number of key enabling technologies that are important to a practical WiMAX network.

MHD simulations for Z- and theta-pinches require the solution of the nonlinear magnetic field diffusion equation at every hydrodynamic time step. This can become a problem with \"standard\" solvers for such equations, given that the electrical conductivity, and hence the magnetic field diffusion coefficient, can vary by orders of magnitude through a plasma. The situation becomes worse in Eulerian MHD codes, where a computational cell can be totally emptied of plasma - the resulting vacuum region has essentially an infinite diffusion coefficient, requiring a near-zero time step. This last problem can be handled by using \"flux-limited\" transport, but the problem of small time steps remains. There is thus a need to develop solvers that can handle such variations in complex 3-D geometries. We have used the 3-D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method to handle such problems. This method directly updates Maxwell's curl equations in time, using an explicit technique, to yield the 3-D variation of electric and magnetic fields. It allows setting up of complex, multimaterial configurations. The problem of small time steps, governed by the Courant criterion and the speed of light, is handled by artificially increasing the free-space permittivity by a suitable factor. in this paper, we report on results obtained with this technique for the case of magnetic field diffusion in accelerating metallic liners in Z-pinch geometries relevant to magnetized target fusion. We examine two cases - one with cylindrical and another with quasi-spherical acceleration. The 3-D electromagnetic field yields the current density distribution through the liner as well as the support assembly, allowing accurate calculation of the electromagnetic forces and Joule heating. To our knowledge, this is the first time this powerful technique has been applied to Z-pinch simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/4198267/4198268/04198639.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.2005.359380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.2005.359380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4198268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4198639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of 3-D FDTD Method for Magnetic Field Diffusion Calculations in Complex Pinch Geometries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Magnetic fields","Geometry","Magnetohydrodynamics","Nonlinear equations","Plasma transport processes","Acceleration","Nonlinear magnetics","Hydrodynamics","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","nonlinear equations","plasma electromagnetic wave propagation","plasma magnetohydrodynamics","plasma ohmic heating","plasma simulation","plasma transport processes","Z pinch"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D FDTD method","MHD simulations","Z pinch","theta pinch","nonlinear magnetic field diffusion equation","electrical conductivity","Eulerian MHD codes","flux-limited transport","finite difference time domain method","Maxwell curl equations","Courant criterion","free-space permittivity","metallic liners","magnetized target fusion","electromagnetic field","current density distribution","Joule heating"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4198639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Use of 3-D FDTD Method for Magnetic Field Diffusion Calculations in Complex Pinch Geometries","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4198639/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"9496861","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of 3-D FDTD Method for Magnetic Field Diffusion Calculations in Complex Pinch Geometries","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PLASMA-00-371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041396S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4198267","isNumber":"4198268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198267","xplore-issue":"4198268","articleId":"4198639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4198814,"authors":[{"name":"Chandana Gamage","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Chandana","lastName":"Gamage","id":"37298656200"},{"name":"Ben Gras","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Gras","id":"37298654300"},{"name":"Bruno Crispo","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Crispo","id":"37298658000"},{"name":"Andrew S Tanenbaum","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Andrew S","lastName":"Tanenbaum","id":"37269511900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0422-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0423-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4198814","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4198814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Identity-based encryption","Digital signatures","Identity management systems","Public key","Ad hoc networks","Security","Public key cryptography","Vehicles","Ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cryptography","digital signatures","mobile computing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity-based ring signature scheme","enhanced privacy","authenticatable messages","signer ambiguity","vehicular ad-hoc network","digital signatures","identity-based cryptographic techniques","vehicle area networks","full key exposure attacks","ubiquitous computing"]}],"abstract":"There are many applications in which it is necessary to transmit authenticatable messages while achieving certain privacy goals such as signer ambiguity. The emerging area of vehicular ad-hoc network is a good example application domain with this requirement The ring signature technique that uses an ad-hoc group of signer identities is a widely used method for generating this type of privacy preserving digital signatures. The identity-based cryptographic techniques do not require certificates. The construction of ring signatures using identity-based cryptography allow for privacy preserving digital signatures to be created in application when certificates are not readily available or desirable such as in vehicle area networks. We propose a new designated verifier identity-based ring signature scheme that is secure against full key exposure attacks even for a small group size. This is a general purpose primitive that can be used in many application domains such as ubiquitous computing where signer ambiguity is required in small groups.
