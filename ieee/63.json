Catastrophic, as well as parameter variation fault models, are used to simulate the faulty response of the opamp circuits. Our method relies on repeated Monte Carlo fault simulations to examine differences in a circuit's response for each possible fault condition. A sine wave is used for the test stimulus in each case. Four closed loop configurations are considered for the study: integrator, differentiator, inverting amplifier, and comparator. We tally the percentage of stuck-at, short, and open faults that are detectable with the feedback applied to demonstrate that the four feedback network configurations have little effect on the catastrophic fault coverage, as compared with similar tests performed for an open-loop configuration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5112002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the testability of CMOS feedback amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the testability of CMOS feedback amplifiers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00630015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035507S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct 1994","isNumber":"13694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4986","citationCount":"4","articleId":"630015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":630021,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The virtual circuit thus obtained, with the extended input-output set, is unate and thus grants a uni-directional error model in correspondence of single stuck-at faults. On such circuit a Berger coding policy can be applied, leading to a self-checking circuit covering all single stuck-at faults.

The system is assumed to be driven by a spatially and temporally i.i.d. non-Gaussian vector sequence (which is not observed). The problem of blind separation of independent linear signals from their convolutive mixtures also leads to the above mathematical model. The model order is unknown. The FIR N/spl times/M (N/spl ges/M) MIMO transfer function is assumed to have full column rank on the unit circle; there are no other assumptions. Higher-order cumulant matching is used to consistently estimate the MIMO impulse response via nonlinear optimization. For blind signal separation the estimated channel is used to decompose the received signal at each sensor into its independent signal components via a Wiener filter. A recently proposed inverse filter criteria based approach (which yields biased estimates in noise) is used to obtain initialization for the cumulant matching approach. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the two approaches for both channel estimation as well as convolutive signal separation.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630060","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"53","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On blind MIMO channel estimation and blind signal separation in unknown additive noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On blind MIMO channel estimation and blind signal separation in unknown additive noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630060/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On blind MIMO channel estimation and blind signal separation in unknown additive noise","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049415S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"5","articleId":"630060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630063,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.

Specially, if the zero-mean transmitted signal is temporally uncorrelated and if the channel bank has no common nonzero zeros, the equalizer bank equalizes the channel bank if, and only if, its composite output is temporally uncorrelated.

It requires only two grids per wavelength because the Fourier transform (through an FFT algorithm) is used to represent spatial derivatives. The wrap-around effect caused by the use of FFT is eliminated by using Berenger's perfectly matched layers (PML). Numerical experiments show that for the same accuracy in the PSTD method with two grids per wavelength, Yee's FDTD algorithm requires 8-16 grids per wavelength. Hence, the PSTD method is 4/sup D/-8/sup D/ times more efficient than FDTD methods (D is the dimensionality of the problem). The PSTD method is ideal for parallel computation of large-scale problems since both the FFT and the PML are well-suited for parallelization.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.630102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Such techniques rely on the fact that the fields radiated or scattered by finite sources enclosed in a ball of radius a and observed on an analytical curve C can be closely approximated by spatially bandlimited functions. The bandwidth is practically /spl beta/a (/spl beta/ being the wavenumber), provided that the phase propagation factor is extracted from the field and the normalized arclength is used to describe C. The extension to the case of a regular surface M is straightforward since this latter can be described by two families of coordinate curves. Recently, efficient sampling techniques have been developed by properly using the theoretical results concerning non-redundant representations of EM fields for source modellings and observation surfaces with the same rotational symmetry. Such techniques allow an accurate field interpolation from a minimum number of data, which remains finite also for unbounded observation geometries. They are based on the most suitable choices for the phase factor and for the parameterizations used to describe M and employ the optimal sampling interpolation (OSI) expansions to minimize the truncation errors. In this paper, the aforementioned 2-D non-redundant field representations are properly extended to obtain an effective 3-D sampling interpolation formula, whose accuracy and effectiveness are assessed by means of numerical tests.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.630112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1997.630112","startPage":"164","endPage":"167 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

In order to further reduce the complexity of the measurement set up as well as the time required for data acquisition, a continuous movement of the positioning system has been suggested leading to measurement points lying on a planar spiral. An effective exploitation of this new scanning system demand for a non-redundant field representation over a spiral (in order to get the minimum number of measurements required and the corresponding samples positions) allowing an efficient interpolation scheme for the evaluation of the field over the scanning plane, typically on a regular rectangular grid of /spl lambda//2 spaced points. In the past a large amount of effort has been devoted in the determination of a non-redundant and numerically efficient representation of the fields on canonical scanning surfaces in order to state the minimum number of required samples, their locations and to develop efficient interpolation algorithms. New field interpolation series allowing the use of a finite number of samples either on a bounded as well as unbounded observation line have been introduced at the University of Naples. Taking into account these results, a new interpolation series of the near-field on a planar spiral is introduced. Furthermore, an interpolation scheme is applied which allows one to evaluate the field on all the measurement planes from samples on a spiral line.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Spirals","Interpolation","Bandwidth","Position measurement","Time measurement","Postal services","Antenna measurements","Electric variables measurement","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiral antennas","antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","electromagnetic fields","interpolation","signal sampling","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-field sampling representation","planar spiral samples","bipolar scanning geometry","positioning system","reliability","cost reduction","measurement set up","data acquisition","measurement points","scanning system","nonredundant field representation","unbounded observation line","bounded observation line","canonical scanning surfaces","interpolation algorithms","field interpolation series","University of Naples","spiral line","antenna far field tests","planar array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.630115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

The recursive convolution approach is difficult to derive, requires complex arithmetic and assumes that the medium is linear. Another category of methods utilizes auxiliary differential equations.

In this paper the auxiliary differential equation method is reformulated so that the solution of the system of linear equations is no longer necessary. Three second order algorithms for Debye and Lorentz dispersion with are obtained. These algorithms require fewer or equal number of unknowns than the corresponding convolution schemes, but are not limited to linear media.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.630163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is an explicit method which implements the time domain Maxwell's equations. It has been used in the simulation of light in nonlinear fiber optical cables, but usually only in one or two dimensions. It has also been shown to be capable of simulating nonlinear phenomena in three dimensions. The problem in simulating a fiber optic cable in three dimensions using the FDTD method is logistical, i.e., having enough computer memory to simulate enough of the cable to make the simulation meaningful. Because the FDTD method is an explicit time domain method, it requires about 10 points per wavelength to maintain accuracy. This is illustrated by an example.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.630165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

The receiver performs joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the amplitudes, phases, time delays, and symbol sequences of all the users. Similar, to the single user receiver we presented by Sharfer and Hero (see Proc.

The algorithm uses grouped coordinate ascent updates to increase the likelihood function in each iteration.

As the underlying problem is NP-complete, a greedy algorithm is proposed to provide rapid, but suboptimal solutions. Due to the one-time programmable characteristic of the switches (commonly referred to as antifuses), only unused (fault-free) routing resources must be utilized for reassignment in a chip with a faulty interconnect. We specifically investigate whether reassignment could be accomplished without changing the global routing of any connections. A RC-tree model for the net delay is also presented; delay bounds are established to fully quantify the degradation due to the reassignment.

The receiver discussed here operates by successively canceling user interferences ranked in order of received power levels.

In single-precision the latency is two clock cycles and in double-precision the latency is three clock cycles, where each pipeline stage contains roughly fifteen logic levels. A single-precision multiplication can be followed immediately by another multiplication of either single or double-precision, A double-precision multiplication requires one stall cycle, namely, two cycles after issuing a double-precision multiplication, a new multiplication of either precision can be issued. Therefore, the throughput in single-precision is one multiplication per clock cycle, and the throughput in double-precision is one multiplication per two clock cycles. Hardware cost is reduced by using only a half-sized multiplication array and by sharing the rounding circuitry for both precisions.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings Second Annual IEEE International Conference on Innovative Systems in Silicon","pdfPath":"/iel3/4984/13692/00630271.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings Second Annual IEEE International Conference on Innovative Systems in Silicon","doi":"10.1109/ICISS.1997.630271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISS.1997.630271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual mode IEEE multiplier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Delay","Throughput","Pipelines","Logic","Hardware","Costs","Circuits","Graphics","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplying circuits","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rounding circuitry","dual mode IEEE floating-point multiplier","double-precision multiplication","single-precision multiplication","latency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A dual mode IEEE multiplier","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5794876","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual mode IEEE multiplier","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00630271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039645S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4984","citationCount":"21","articleId":"630271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":630272,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Throughput improvement is obtained at the price of a small reduction in average latency by allowing the unit to run with variable latency. Although this design paradigm has proved to be very effective, there are still some issues that need to be addressed before it can be used in practice: First, the introduction of variable-latency units complicates the control flow, and therefore the design of the controller. Second, the availability of telescopic units affects the way the high-level synthesis algorithms operate; this is because such units provide additional alternatives for realizing maximum-speed designs. This paper focuses on the first aspect, and gives a general criterion for the re-design of a controller when some data-path units are replaced by telescopic units. The viability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings Second Annual IEEE International Conference on Innovative Systems in Silicon","pdfPath":"/iel3/4984/13692/00630272.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings Second Annual IEEE International Conference on Innovative Systems in Silicon","doi":"10.1109/ICISS.1997.630272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISS.1997.630272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient controller design for telescopic units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Hardware design languages","Throughput","Delay","Circuit synthesis","Control systems","Automatic control","Laboratories","High level synthesis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","logic design","finite state machines","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controller design","telescopic units","combinational block","throughput improvement","average latency","variable-latency units","high-level synthesis algorithms","maximum-speed designs","data-path unit replacement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient controller design for telescopic units","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5794877","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient controller design for telescopic units","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00630272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06364S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4984","citationCount":"6","articleId":"630272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630273,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Using the desired signature code and an orthogonal to it code, we can decompose the receiving signals into two subspaces: signal and interference. The EDIC beamformer can handle a large number of users with a small number of antenna elements and the weights can be blindly updated according to these two subspaces. A recursive algorithm with low computational complexity has been developed for IS-95 systems. In slow fading environments, we further reduce the computational complexity by down sampling the interference and by slowly tracking the desired channel response.

While the design of the forward link does not seem difficult (as many papers have demonstrated), the same conclusion is not valid for the reverse link. Here we present a new architecture based on OFDM and slow frequency hopping code division multiple access (OFDM/SFH-CDMA) which seems to be suitable for the reverse link where users transmit asynchronously. For its simplicity of implementation we consider incoherent DQPSK as the modulation scheme. We find that the joint use of channel coding, sub-carrier interleaving and antenna diversity is capable of significantly reducing the error rate (three orders of magnitude at SNR/bit=25 dB). In particular, the use of antenna diversity appears to be indispensable because it provides the required significant reduction of the error rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse link performance of a coded OFDM/SFH-CDMA transmission scheme","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630347","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630347.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Reverse link performance of a coded OFDM/SFH-CDMA transmission scheme","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808689","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse link performance of a coded OFDM/SFH-CDMA transmission scheme","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038357S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"1","articleId":"630347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630353,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.P.

The MOE detector can be blindly adapted with standard adaptive algorithms without the knowledge of interferer's parameters. But the performance of the MOE detector may degrade substantially if the multipath interference causes a signature mismatch. A projection-based blind adaptive multiuser detector is proposed. The proposed detector is motivated by the linearity of multipath interference. We construct a subspace that is orthogonal to the space spanned by the desired signature vector with different possible delays. If the steering vector is in the orthogonal subspace in each step of the adaptive algorithm, there is no cancellation of the desired signal. Thus better performance can be expected in the presence of linear multipath interferences.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630360","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive multiuser CDMA detection based on a linear projection constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive multiuser CDMA detection based on a linear projection constraint","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630360/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808694","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive multiuser CDMA detection based on a linear projection constraint","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04108S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"10","articleId":"630360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630366,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such techniques have been considered as powerful methods for increasing the overall system quality, capacity and coverage. With a large number of adaptive weights, LMS type algorithms suffer from poor convergence while conventional least squares techniques can be computationally prohibitive. To mitigate these problems, this paper presents a two-stage blind adaptive receiver architecture which carries out multiuser detection using an optimal bounding ellipsoid (OBE) algorithm and direction-of-arrival estimation based beamforming using a novel, simple yet robust algorithm referred to as differential phase smoothing. The unique discerning update property of the OBE algorithms allows for a reduced complexity receiver. Furthermore, the adaptive multiuser detector also inherits improved convergence and tracking properties. Simulation results demonstrating its performance are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind multiuser detection and interference cancellation in DS-CDMA mobile radio systems","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630366","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630366.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Blind multiuser detection and interference cancellation in DS-CDMA mobile radio systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808696","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind multiuser detection and interference cancellation in DS-CDMA mobile radio systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03456S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"3","articleId":"630366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630367,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A variation of this 2D RAKE receiver is presented herein yielding a faster convergence rate and lower variance in the output SINR. In contrast to previously proposed techniques, bit synchronization for the SDC is not required. The algorithm presented herein asymptotically provides the exact time of arrivals of the multipaths within a bit period, and subsequently the optimum space-time weights for combining the fingers across both space and time. The instrumental property exploited in this technique is the fact that although the respective spectra of the SDC and MUAI components at the output of the matched filter are statistically equal, the respective spectra of their squared values differ.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630367","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"273","endPage":"276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind space-time processor for SINR maximization in CDMA cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind space-time processor for SINR maximization in CDMA cellular systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630367/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808697","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind space-time processor for SINR maximization in CDMA cellular systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03015S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"4","articleId":"630367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630371,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, in order to use statistical models in simulating or analyzing the performance of array processing or diversity combining, it is also necessary to know the statistics of the angle of arrival and its correlation with time of arrival. In this paper, a system is described which was used to collect simultaneous time and angle of arrival data at 7 GHz. Data processing methods are outlined, and results of data taken in two different buildings are presented. Based on the results, a model is proposed that employs a clustered \"double Poisson\" time of arrival model. The angular distribution is also clustered, with uniformly distributed clusters, and arrivals within clusters that have Laplacian distribution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630373","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630373.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments in modeling the space-time indoor wireless communication channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Experiments in modeling the space-time indoor wireless communication channel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5801131","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments in modeling the space-time indoor wireless communication channel","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027391S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"1","articleId":"630373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":630377,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Recently wideband CDMA systems have been proposed, the wideband waveforms require on the order of 5 to 15 MHz of bandwidth. In this paper the effect of channel propagation on the performance of wideband systems is examined. Since traditional narrowband analysis will not be sufficient for these systems wideband methods based on calculating the time domain channel impulse response are employed. The wideband channel response is modeled using a broadband parabolic equation propagation model. Presently, only two-dimensional range dependent propagation is considered, contributions due to out of plane scattering are not included.","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630382.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of propagation on wideband DS-CDMA systems in the suburban environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Narrowband","Frequency","Oceans","Surveillance","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","cellular radio","land mobile radio","time-domain analysis","transient response","telecommunication channels","parabolic equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation effect","wideband DS-CDMA systems","suburban environment","direct sequence code division multiple access","cellular industry","performance","wideband waveforms","bandwidth","channel propagation","time domain channel impulse response","modelling","broadband parabolic equation propagation model","two-dimensional range dependent propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"The effect of propagation on wideband DS-CDMA systems in the suburban environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808707","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of propagation on wideband DS-CDMA systems in the suburban environment","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029384S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"1","articleId":"630382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630383,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We focus on the so-called Volterra models and the input-output aspect of the identification problem. To this date, closed form solutions for the Volterra kernels exist only for Gaussian inputs and they are usually in rather complicated forms. In this paper, we adopt a class of non-Gaussian inputs, namely the PSK (phase shift keying) sequences, which are common in digital communications systems. Such signals allow for simple closed form solutions of the Volterra kernels of any order. Kernels are estimated separately thus preventing error propagation. Signal independent zero-mean additive noise can also be tolerated even when its color and distribution are unknown. Because closed form solutions for the kernels are available, explicit variance expressions for their estimates can also be derived. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630383","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear channel identification and performance analysis with PSK inputs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear channel identification and performance analysis with PSK inputs","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630383/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808708","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear channel identification and performance analysis with PSK inputs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057054S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"14","articleId":"630383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630386,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The prior knowledge considered here corresponds to the transmitter (TX) (pulse shaping) and/or receiver (RX) filters present in digital communication systems. Exploitation of this prior knowledge allows the estimation to concentrate on the impulse response of the actual channel part itself. Hence this estimation can be done more accurately. Since the prior information is expressed in terms of the channel impulse response, we review a number of blind channel estimation methods that are parameterized by the channel and consider their extension to incorporate the prior knowledge. These methods include subchannel response matching (SRM), subspace fitting and maximum likelihood (ML) techniques. We also discuss performance limits in the form of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs). Both the methods and the CRBs are discussed in a deterministic and a Gaussian context for the unknown transmitted symbols. Simulation results indicate that the exploitation of the prior knowledge can lead to significant improvements, that one particular SRM WPK method often outperforms another one, and that ML methods can still further improve performance.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630390.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630390","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630390","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Blind equalizers","Integrated circuit noise","Information filtering","Information filters","Transmitters","Pulse shaping methods","Digital filters","Digital communication","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","FIR filters","telecommunication channels","maximum likelihood estimation","transient response","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao bounds","knowledge based estimation","multiple FIR channels","blind identification","prior knowledge","transmitter","pulse shaping","receiver","filters","digital communication systems","impulse response","blind channel estimation","subchannel response matching","subspace fitting","maximum likelihood","performance","deterministic context","Gaussian context","unknown transmitted symbols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630390/","displayDocTitle":"Cramer-Rao bounds and methods for knowledge based estimation of multiple FIR channels","accessionNumber":"5808711","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer-Rao bounds and methods for knowledge based estimation of multiple FIR channels","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038234S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"15","articleId":"630390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630398,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To estimate the delay parameters appearing in the data model, several authors have proposed subspace-based solutions. Unfortunately, these methods, for example the eigenvector-based multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method are computationally quite expensive. In addition, when the number of users or propagation paths is unknown, it should be estimated accurately. To this end, one can use relatively the simple minimum description length (MDL) criterion, but it fails when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not sufficiently high. In this paper, we introduce subspace type delay estimation and tracking algorithms which are clearly more efficient than MUSIC with MDL. These algorithms use a new criterion for determining the model order. Simulations show that the new methods outperform standard MUSIC.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630400","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630400.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace algorithms for synchronization and tracking in CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subspace algorithms for synchronization and tracking in CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630400/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808713","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace algorithms for synchronization and tracking in CDMA","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049888S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"1","articleId":"630400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630402,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It has been shown that the acquisition in the presence of multiple-access interference may impose a significant limitation on capacity. It is known that by using concatenated spreading sequences (also known as Kronecker sequences) instead of conventional sequences (e.g. gold sequences), the acquisition time of serial-search acquisition schemes can be reduced for large signal-to-noise ratios (>15 dB). In this paper, we investigate the acquisition time of concatenated sequences for low signal-to-noise ratios. We consider different acquisition schemes employing the MAX criterion which are used for the acquisition of the inner sequence. Analytical expressions for mean and variance of the acquisition time are derived and verified through simulations. We compare the acquisition time using concatenated spreading sequences with the acquisition time using conventional spreading sequences. To reduce deteriorations due to non-vanishing auto-correlation sidelobes and multiple-access interference, we employ inverse filtering and interference cancellation. The results indicate that concatenated spreading sequences can considerably speed up code acquisition even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630402","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630402.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast acquisition in DS-CDMA using concatenated spreading sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630402/","displayDocTitle":"Fast acquisition in DS-CDMA using concatenated spreading sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808714","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast acquisition in DS-CDMA using concatenated spreading sequences","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031915S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"2","articleId":"630402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":630408,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

In this paper we introduce the per-branch processing (PBP) method as a general case of PSP, which has the advantages of PSP and allows more than one estimation per symbol to improve the receiver error performance in fast fading. The Kalman filter is considered for channel estimation and the overall bit error rate (BER) performance is shown to be superior to that of detection techniques using the RLS and LMS estimators. Three different square-root methods for implementation of the Kalman filter are analyzed and compared with the RLS and LMS algorithms based on different number of bits required for implementation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630408.pdf","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data and channel estimation using the per-branch processing method","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630408","startPage":"389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Joint data and channel estimation using the per-branch processing method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630408/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5801139","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data and channel estimation using the per-branch processing method","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048356S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"4","articleId":"630408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":630413,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Previously proposed methods rely on the filtered phase information of pilots in two consecutive symbols demodulated at the same estimated frequency. To continuously update the demodulation frequency, these estimation techniques require two demodulators to determine two symbols at each symbol period. The proposed method allows the frequency to vary using one demodulator. The frequency estimates are evaluated based on previous pilot information. Since the phase information between two consecutive pilots includes the frequency difference when the pilots were evaluated, appropriate filtering must be added. This paper derives the FIR filter that must be included in the loop. The estimator bias and variance of the frequency estimate, and the performance of the filter are evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630413","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","startPage":"401","endPage":"404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency synchronization and tracking in COFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency synchronization and tracking in COFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630413/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808718","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency synchronization and tracking in COFDM systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034515S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","articleId":"630413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630416,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

If the channel is relatively benign and fading is not severe, one may obtain higher bit rates for an equivalent bandwidth by using M-ary QAM modulation (MQAM). A variation, used to combat channel fading while still retaining MQAM, is differential MQAM (i.e. DQAM). The term differential refers to the phase which is coded exactly as in DPSK; however, the amplitude is still subject to distortion by the fading channel. In this paper, we propose a technique called quotient coding, which is designed to remove channel effects from the symbol amplitude as well as its phase. In particular, we shall apply it to MQAM resulting in modulation which we term QQAM. In contrast to DQAM, QQAM is just as effective at suppressing the effects of channel fading with respect to the entire symbol as DPSK is for the phase alone. Furthermore, it can be applied to arbitrary MQAM configurations.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630416","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4966/13657/00630416.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.1997.630416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QQAM: a step beyond DQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630416/","displayDocTitle":"QQAM: a step beyond DQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5808720","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QQAM: a step beyond DQAM","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00630416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059097S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1997","isNumber":"13657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4966","citationCount":"3","articleId":"630416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630427,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The two-stage algorithm is designed to take advantage of the merits of each technique. The GA is employed to find neighborhoods of high quality solutions and to provide a good initial guess for the sensitivity-based heuristic. The heuristic uses the sensitivity of real power loss to reactive power to quickly and locally improve upon the solution provided by the GA with less computation than by allowing the GA to continue.

Over a time-span of a few minutes, these changes are primarily random. The random load variations act as a constant low-level excitation to the electromechanical dynamics of the power system which shows up as ambient noise in field measured voltage, current and power signals. Assuming the random variations are white and stationary over an analysis window, it is theoretically possible to estimate the electromechanical modal frequencies and damping from the spectral content of the ambient noise. In this paper, field collected ambient noise is analyzed by solving the Wiener-Hopf linear prediction equations to estimate the modal frequency and damping. These estimates are then compared with results from a Prony analysis on a ringdown resulting from a 1400 MW brake insertion under the same operating conditions as the ambient data. Results show that estimates are consistent between the ambient and ringdown analysis indicating that it is possible to estimate a power system's electromechanical characteristics simply from ambient data. These results demonstrate that it may be possible to provide power system control and operation algorithms with a real-time estimate of modal frequency and damping.","doi":"10.1109/59.630467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/13697/00630467.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.630467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13697","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initial results in electromechanical mode identification from ambient data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Initial results in electromechanical mode identification from ambient data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5662461","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initial results in electromechanical mode identification from ambient data","sourcePdf":"00630467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069611S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"243","articleId":"630467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":630469,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The models are based on the representation of voltages and currents as time-varying Fourier series, and focus on the dynamics of the short-term Fourier coefficients. Truncating the series to keep only the fundamental components provides a natural dynamic generalization of the familiar quasi-static phasor representation. Systematic simplifications or refinements of their fundamental phasor dynamics model yield a variety of other models. The authors establish that even the simplest of these models predicts the dynamic behavior of the TCSC very accurately. Their phasor models provide a powerful basis for simulation, more than an order of magnitude faster than detailed time-domain circuit simulation. The phasor models present an attractive alternative to sampled-data models, having the advantages of simpler representation, modularity and direct compatibility with the phasor models that are routinely used to represent the dynamics of generators and other power system components.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.630469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13697","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/13697/00630469.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phasor dynamics of thyristor-controlled series capacitor systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Phasor dynamics of thyristor-controlled series capacitor systems","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5662463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phasor dynamics of thyristor-controlled series capacitor systems","sourcePdf":"00630469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052814S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"102","articleId":"630469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":630471,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

However, the incomplete factorization for a symmetric and positive definite matrix is not necessarily positive definite.

In this environment, all power transactions are made based on price rather than cost. A regional power pool is noted as the most straightforward path to a deregulated electricity marketplace. However, many questions remain unanswered regarding the economics of power pool participation. In a deregulated energy marketplace, participants are interested in maximizing their own profits, regardless of the system-wide profits. It is perceived that competition will reduce the price of electricity for retail customers, however, the key issue for participants is related with the price definition to remain competitive. In this paper, the authors use game theory to simulate the decision making process for defining offered prices in a deregulated environment. The outcome of this study may be used by power pool coordinators to discourage unfair coalitions. A modified IEEE 30 bus power system is used as a deregulated power pool to illustrate the main features of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transaction analysis in deregulated power systems using game theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.630479","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/13697/00630479.pdf","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.630479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Transaction analysis in deregulated power systems using game theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5662473","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transaction analysis in deregulated power systems using game theory","sourcePdf":"00630479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039964S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"242","articleId":"630479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":630485,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.Z. de Souza","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Federal Engineering School of Itajuba, Itajuba, Minas Gerais, Brazil"],"firstName":"A.C.Z.","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37274835000"},{"name":"C.A.

Also, tangent vectors are used to define a clustering method for the identification at any operating condition of the critical area at the collapse point, and a new voltage stability index is defined based on the identification of this critical area.

However, high bit rate transmission is restricted by large chromatic dispersion of the conventional simple mode fiber (SMF) unless compensating techniques are used. The chirped fiber gratings (CFGs) are attractive as they are passive linear devices, with highly related dispersion, compact size and are relatively easy to fabricate. Using CFGs for dispersion compensation, the EDFAs are inserted repeatedly between SMF and optical circulators (OCs) in order to amplify the signals. However, the repeated spacing is limited by the loss of CFGs, SMF and OCs. In this report, by inserting a bi-directional EDFA between the OC and CFGs, we proposed an optical limiting amplifier (OLA) configuration in multi-wavelength for dispersion compensation. The link budget and dynamic range characteristics, bit-error-rate (BER) performance as well as the eye-diagram of the modulated signals were investigated and discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LEOS.1997.630499","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings.

Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) can be used for wide-band all-optical signal regeneration, optical gating, and photonic switching applications. However, the higher channel crosstalk limits its system utilization. Recent works on gain clamped SOAs were trying to overcome the problem. A strong but out-of-band optical signal is used to clamp the carrier (gain) in an SOA. The clamping signal can be provided through an internally distributed feedback (DFB) or distributed-Bragg-reflector (DBR) laser or from an externally injected optical source. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare both schemes and to find a more effective way to achieve high gain, low crosstalk, wide-band signal regeneration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LEOS.1997.630654","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings.

As CMOS technology moves from 0.35 /spl mu/m to 0.1 /spl mu/m minimum feature sizes, minimum interconnect pitches are projected to shrink from 1.0 /spl mu/m to 0.27 /spl mu/m. Several factors may make BEOL yield a dominant concern in submicron manufacturing. Since both microprocessor (logic) transistor densities and chip areas are projected to grow from 4 M/cm/sup 2/ and 250 mm/sup 2/ to 50 M/cm/sup 2/ and 520 mm/sup 2/, the difficulty of interconnecting devices becomes much greater. Solving this wireability problem requires significant increases in the number of wiring levels on a chip. Shrinking interconnect pitches, an increased number of wiring levels, and increased chip area all combine to reduce BEOL yield. To achieve 90% product yield the SIA roadmap proposes substantial reductions in defect density. This paper predicts defect density requirements and wiring strategies which combine high performance with high yield as minimum feature sizes shrink from 0.35 /spl mu/m to 0.1 /spl mu/m. Predictions are made using a CAD tool, RIPE, the Rensselaer Interconnect Performance Estimator, which predicts the effects of interconnect technology, system design, and wiring strategy on wireability, performance, power, and BEOL yield. We predict about 99% BEOL yield using the SIA proposals for defect density. Significantly higher defect densities should give acceptable yields.","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.1997.630712","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop ASMC 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop ASMC 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/4995/13712/00630712.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.1997.630712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEOL yield predictions for SIA roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630712/","displayDocTitle":"BEOL yield predictions for SIA roadmap","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5780944","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEOL yield predictions for SIA roadmap","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00630712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026711S","chronDate":"10-12 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4995","citationCount":"8","articleId":"630712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":630739,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The lower error proportions for ENNs on fault prone, not fault prone, and overall classification were found to be statistically significant. The robustness of ENNs follows from their superior performance on the range of data configurations used.

The methodology of this technique is presented in a companion paper (Ammar et al., 1997). This technique is applied on the Earth Operation Commanding Center; a large component of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) project. Two specifications of the system are considered: a sequential model and a pipeline model. Results of applying the above technique to both CPN-based models yield different complexity measures. The pipeline model shows clearly a higher risk factor than the sequential model. Whereas using traditional complexity measures, the risk factors were similar in both models.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.1997.630861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.1997.630861","startPage":"156","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings The Eighth International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4993/13710/00630861.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings The Eighth International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An example of risk assessment of software systems specifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov1997","displayDocTitle":"An example of risk assessment of software systems specifications","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5768022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630861/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An example of risk assessment of software systems specifications","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00630861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041877S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov1997","isNumber":"13710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4993","citationCount":"2","articleId":"630861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":630875,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

Regression testing is usually performed by running some, or all, of the test cases created to test modifications in previous versions of the software. Many techniques have been reported on how to select regression tests so that the number of test cases does not grow too large as the software evolves. Our proposed hybrid technique combines modification, minimization and prioritization-based selection using a list of source code changes and the execution traces from test cases run on previous versions. This technique seeks to identify a representative subset of all test cases that may result in different output behavior on the new software version. We report our experience with a tool called ATAC (Automatic Testing Analysis tool in C) which implements this technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.1997.630875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings The Eighth International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings The Eighth International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4993/13710/00630875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.1997.630875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13710","startPage":"264","endPage":"274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of effective regression testing in practice","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study of effective regression testing in practice","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630875/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5768033","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of effective regression testing in practice","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00630875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043198S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov1997","isNumber":"13710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4993","citationCount":"162","articleId":"630875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":630891,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The consequence of increasing the modulation index is explored as a cost free means of multipath mitigation. An increase from 0.5 (MSK) to 1 was found to yield a worthwhile improvement in tolerable delay spread. Increasing the index beyond 1 gave no further improvement but significantly affected the spectral occupancy of the signal.

This \"hybrid\" scheme is applicable to the noncoherent uplink of the IS-95 system where up to now only M-ary orthogonal modulation is used. The additional, PSK-modulated data show a slightly increased bit error rate (BER) compared to the data from M-ary modulation. However, the overall degradation caused hereby is far outweighed by the gain achieved by a higher spreading factor. Analytical results confirmed by simulations yield an improvement of approximately 1.0 dB in terms of E/sub b//N/sub 0/ on a Rayleigh fading channel when no channel coding is used. This considerable gain is achieved upon only slight modification of the conventional modulation/demodulation procedure at a low additional complexity.

In this model, which is modified to account for flat fading, the received signal at a given cell-site is the sum of the faded signals transmitted from all users within that cell, plus an attenuation factor /spl alpha/ /spl isin/ [0,1] times the sum of the faded signals received from the adjacent cells, accompanied with an additive Gaussian noise. Although this simple model is scarcely realistic, it serves as a simple tractable model which provides considerable insight into complex and intractable real-world cellular communication systems. We assume a hyper (super)-receiver, jointly decoding all the users, using the received signals from all the active cell-sites. The hyper-receiver is assumed to be aware of the codebooks and realizations of the fading processes of each user. We consider the intra-cell time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol which is known to be equivalent to the optimal protocol under the average power constraint in the absence of fading. We are interested in the maximum reliably transmitted equal rate (system throughput per user). Bounds on this rate are found by incorporating information-theoretic inequalities and the Tchebycheff-Markov moment bounding technique. We observe the rather surprising result that flat fading (Rayleigh) may increase the maximum equal rate for a certain range of /spl alpha/ and signal to noise ratio (SNR) in comparison to the non-faded case.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630903","startPage":"276","endPage":"280 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00630903.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shannon-theoretic considerations for a Gaussian cellular TDMA multiple-access channel with fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Shannon-theoretic considerations for a Gaussian cellular TDMA multiple-access channel with fading","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5855460","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630903/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shannon-theoretic considerations for a Gaussian cellular TDMA multiple-access channel with fading","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00630903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032327S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","articleId":"630903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":630909,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Irving, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Lin Ma","id":"37734150500"},{"name":"M.O.

Due to the TDD nature of the residential system, both the forward and reverse link signals are transmitted in the same frequency band in different time slots. Dynamic channel allocation (DCA) is used to select either the PCS uplink or the PCS downlink frequency band for the indoor system operation. The developed simulation bed measures the effects of the indoor system to the outdoor system and vice versa.

We propose the use of an approximate upper bound and then further linearize it for ease of designing the test scheme.

This type of receiver architecture is characterized by high intermediate frequencies (IFs), often in the 100-250 MHz range. At these IFs the conventional theory shows that for non-spread modulation schemes a small amount of sample clock jitter can lead to significant phase modulation of the desired signal thus limiting the SNR at the ADC output. Unfortunately, the same theory cannot be directly applied to spread spectrum (SS) systems in which the IF SNR is very low. This paper shows that, neglecting adjacent channel interference, the principal effect of sample clock jitter in direct-sequence SS receivers is to reduce chip coherency during despreading. Results are derived relating the loss of receiver performance to the IF frequency and the ADC sample clock single-sideband phase noise density to carrier ratio. These results are then used to define sample clock jitter requirements for an exemplary IS-95 IF-sampling receiver.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Jitter","Frequency","Phase modulation","Wideband","Dynamic range","Spread spectrum communication","Signal to noise ratio","Interchannel interference","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample clock jitter","IF-sampling IS-95 receivers","direct IF undersampling","receiver architecture","intermediate frequencies","spread spectrum systems","direct-sequence SS receivers","chip coherency","despreading","receiver performance","ADC sample clock single-sideband phase noise density to carrier ratio","100 to 250 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630946","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00630946.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"370 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of sample clock jitter on IF-sampling IS-95 receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of sample clock jitter on IF-sampling IS-95 receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630946/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855476","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of sample clock jitter on IF-sampling IS-95 receivers","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00630946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037942S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"12","articleId":"630946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":630947,"authors":[{"name":"R.

MACA-BI is a simplified version of the well known MACA (Multiple Access Collision Avoidance) protocol, which is based on the request to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) handshake and which has inspired the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard. In MACA-BI, the RTS part of the RTS/CTS handshake is suppressed, leaving only the clear to send a control message which can be viewed as an \"invitation\" by the receiver to transmit. This reduction greatly improves the efficiency when radio turn-around time is significant with respect to packet transmission time. Yet, it preserves the \"data\" collision free property of MACA. Simulation results for various multihop topologies show that, when the traffic characteristics are stationary or predictable, MACA-BI outperforms several known multiple access protocols, especially when \"hidden terminal\" conditions are predominant.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630970","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00630970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.630970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","startPage":"435","endPage":"439 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MACA-BI (MACA By Invitation)-a receiver oriented access protocol for wireless multihop networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MACA-BI (MACA By Invitation)-a receiver oriented access protocol for wireless multihop networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630970/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862914","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MACA-BI (MACA By Invitation)-a receiver oriented access protocol for wireless multihop networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00630970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044348S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"59","articleId":"630970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":630990,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors describe some changes to the Ethernet CSMA/CD medium access control algorithm that allow CSMA/CD to be used in this case. First, carrier extension is used to increase the slot time without requiring a corresponding increase in the minimum frame length. Second, frame bursting is introduced so that a host may transmit more than one frame without releasing control of the channel, in a manner that increases the efficiency for small frames without changing its one-frame-at-a-time service interface. Using simulation, they show that CSMA/CD with carrier extension and frame bursting operating on 1 Gb/s links provides a significant performance increase over 100 Mb/s fast Ethernet. These changes are being adopted by the IEEE 802.32 task force, which is currently defining the standard for Gigabit Ethernet.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.1997.630990","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 22nd Annual Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 22nd Annual Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/4987/13695/00630990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.1997.630990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13695","startPage":"211","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling CSMA/CD to 1 Gb/s with frame bursting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=630990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scaling CSMA/CD to 1 Gb/s with frame bursting","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/630990/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5766153","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling CSMA/CD to 1 Gb/s with frame bursting","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00630990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03848S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov1997","isNumber":"13695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4987","citationCount":"3","articleId":"630990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":630992,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Finally, an example is given to illustrate how prediction results could be displayed to provide some insights into the accuracy of the model. For comparison purpose, results from power law curve fits are also analyzed. It is concluded that the standard deviation is a fair characterization of the accuracy of a model as long as its value is small (<-7 dB). For larger value, the figure of merit can be more useful.

The standard version of the LMMSE detector depends on the channel coefficients of all users and cannot be used in frequency-selective fading channels due to fast changes of channel phases which demands for continuous detector updating. In this paper, a modified criterion for deriving LMMSE receivers in fading channels is used, which effectively converts the pathological Rayleigh fading channel to an equivalent fixed AWGN channel from the detector point of view. Thus, the detector is independent from the user's complex channel coefficients. Adaptive versions of the modified LMMSE receiver require estimation of channel delays and complex coefficients. An adaptive least mean squares (LMS) algorithm for DS-CDMA downlink receivers utilizing a pilot channel for channel estimation is presented as an example of a practical implementation of the scheme. The numerical results show that the modified criterion can be applied in downlink receivers in fading channels and the adaptive version converges close to the optimal LMMSE solution.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631077","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00631077.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"558 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified adaptive LMMSE receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631077/","displayDocTitle":"Modified adaptive LMMSE receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862938","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified adaptive LMMSE receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00631077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077298S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"25","articleId":"631077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":631078,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is used to suppress the multiple-access interference (MAI) in the receiver. In order to improve the MAI estimates, the multistage principle is used. In this paper, three main issues have been studied: the effect of feeding back the channel estimates from the last stage with a different number of cancellation stages, the hang-up phenomenon as well as means to avoid that in PIC receivers, and the impact of channel estimators on the receiver performance. The PIC based multistage receiver developed in the course of these studies had good performance in fading channels according to the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631078","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00631078.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"564 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel interference cancellation receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631078/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel interference cancellation receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862939","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel interference cancellation receiver for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00631078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034987S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"13","articleId":"631078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":631095,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Thus, in such cases the M-stage receiver has an asymptotic multiuser efficiency which is greater than zero as M/spl rarr//spl infin/ for all user energies, i.e. it is near-far resistant. Additionally, while not strictly near-far resistant in the case of M</spl infin/, we show that significant improvement in AME is achieved when compared to the conventional receiver.

It is proposed that, for operation in the millimetre-wave indoor channel, directional antennas can be used to mitigate multipath effects, thus reducing the need for complex equalisation or multi-carrier techniques. An image based, ray-tracing prediction model is used to study the channel characteristics and to analyse the variation in received power, RMS delay spread and k-factor within a typical operating environment. The performances of different antenna combinations are investigated and narrowbeam, suitably aligned antennas are shown to reduce received delay spread for both LOS and non-LOS locations. The effects of non-optimal antenna alignment are observed, and system outage is determined for certain system design criteria. The results suggest that it will feasible to combat multipath effects using switched-beam directional antennas.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631109","startPage":"635","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00631109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631109","endPage":"639 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating the effects of antenna directivity on wireless indoor communication at 60 GHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the effects of antenna directivity on wireless indoor communication at 60 GHz","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5862954","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the effects of antenna directivity on wireless indoor communication at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00631109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06565S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"32","articleId":"631109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":631112,"authors":[{"name":"K.I.

The architecture arbitrates fairly between connections with conforming cells by carefully integrating leaky-bucket traffic shaping with rate-based scheduling algorithms. Through a careful combination of per-connection queueing and approximate sorting, the shaper performs a small, bounded number of operations in response to each arrival and departure, independent of the number of connections and cells. To handle a wider range of rate parameters, a hierarchical arbitration scheme can reduce the implementation overheads and the interference between competing connections.

At the same time, fault management is becoming more difficult due to the dynamic nature and heterogeneity of networks. We propose an intelligent monitoring system using adaptive statistical techniques. The system continually learns the normal behavior of the network and detects deviations from the norm. Within the monitoring system, the measurements are segmented, and features extracted from the segments are used to describe the normal behavior of the measurement variables. This information is combined in the structure of a Bayesian network. The proposed system is thereby able to detect unknown or unseen faults. Experimental results on real network data demonstrate that the proposed system can detect abnormal behavior before a fault actually occurs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13685/00631137.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1155 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive network fault detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Monitoring","Communication networks","Availability","Telecommunication network reliability","Intelligent systems","Adaptive systems","Feature extraction","Data mining","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network management","computerised monitoring","statistical analysis","Bayes methods","telecommunication computing","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive network fault detection","communication networks","network availability","network reliability","automated fault management","intelligent monitoring system","adaptive statistical techniques","measurements","feature extraction","normal behavior","measurement variables","Bayesian network","experimental results","real network data","abnormal behavior detection","learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Proactive network fault detection","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5919838","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive network fault detection","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00631137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033877S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"49","articleId":"631137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":631144,"authors":[{"name":"T.V.

Even if the actual bandwidth asymmetry is moderate, high effective asymmetries can result because of bidirectional traffic. Our objective is to determine, whether TCP/IP performs reasonably in a setting in which the reverse link is the primary bottleneck. Our main results are as follows. (1) For both the prevalent Tahoe version with Fast Retransmit and the Reno version of TCP we determine the throughput as a function of buffering, round-trip times and normalized asymmetry (taken to be the ratio of the transmission time of ACKs in the reverse path to that of data packets in the forward path). We identify three modes of operation which are dependent on the forward buffer sizes and the normalized asymmetry. (2) Asymmetry increases the TCP's already high sensitivity to random packet losses that might be caused by transient bursts in real-time traffic. Specifically, random loss leads to significant throughput deterioration when the product of the loss probability, the asymmetry and the square of the bandwidth delay product is large. (3) Congestion in the reverse path adds considerably to the TCP's unfairness when multiple connections share the reverse link. Link bandwidth sharing is unfair even for connections with identical round-trip times and hence use of per connection buffer allocation on the reverse path appears essential.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631144","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13685/00631144.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631144","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1209 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Window-based error recovery and flow control with a slow acknowledgement channel: a study of TCP/IP performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Window-based error recovery and flow control with a slow acknowledgement channel: a study of TCP/IP performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631144/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5919844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-based error recovery and flow control with a slow acknowledgement channel: a study of TCP/IP performance","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00631144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034302S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"69","articleId":"631144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":631150,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

To allow true VOD, one approach is to have a dedicated video stream for each customer. This is expensive, especially when multiple identical video streams are sent to multiple customers accessing the same video. To be commercially viable, VOD service must be priced competitively with existing video rental services. Batching may be used to reduce this cost. It allows multiple users accessing the same video to share the same video stream. The batching approach, however, complicates the provision of user interactions. Existing batching schemes only allow near VOD services. This paper describes a new protocol, called split and merge (SAM), which offers true VOD services while allowing multiple users to share the same video stream. This sharing is transparent to the users and it appears as if each has a dedicated video stream. Our approach is to split an interactive user from the batch and to serve him with a dedicated video stream. We develop an innovative way to merge these individuals back to the batching streams when they resume normal play mode. The SAM protocol therefore significantly improves the system resource utilization and the number of simultaneous users, and more importantly, allows true VOD services.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631168/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5919861","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The split and merge (SAM) protocol for interactive video-on-demand systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The split and merge (SAM) protocol for interactive video-on-demand systems","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00631168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073403S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"10","articleId":"631168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":631171,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The simulation emphasizes the encoder, decoder/correlator, and a threshold detector; but assumes a resultant Gaussian function for the \"air interface\" noise. Since the characteristics of a wireless environment vary significantly, we examine, as a whole, the errors on the received signal without accounting for specific error contributions from power, fading, propagation, interference from other users, and other factors in such an environment. The CDMA encoder uses the 64 Walsh codes that are specified in the draft Wideband CDMA Air Interface Compatibility Standard for 1.85 to 1.99 GHz PCS Applications. We use a digitized actual speech database to test for the intelligibility of the voice service over such a CDMA air interface. Therefore, we are able to learn about the nature of the errors inherent in such a frequency spreading technique and also determine an upper bound on the simultaneous active channels that would preserve the quality of service (QOS).","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631171","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13700/00631171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.631171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13700","startPage":"719","endPage":"723 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error characteristics of CDMA and impact on voice, e-mail, and Web pages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error characteristics of CDMA and impact on voice, e-mail, and Web pages","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631171/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error characteristics of CDMA and impact on voice, e-mail, and Web pages","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00631171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053232S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"1","articleId":"631171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":631173,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The protocol is one of a family of protocols which we term \"link reversal\" algorithms. The protocol's reaction is structured as a temporally-ordered sequence of diffusing computations; each computation consisting of a sequence of directed link reversals. The protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable; being best-suited for use in large, dense, mobile networks. In these networks, the protocol's reaction to link failures typically involves only a localized \"single pass\" of the distributed algorithm. This capability is unique among protocols which are stable in the face of network partitions, and results in the protocol's high degree of adaptivity. This desirable behavior is achieved through the novel use of a \"physical or logical clock\" to establish the \"temporal order\" of topological change events which is used to structure (or order) the algorithm's reaction to topological changes. We refer to the protocol as the temporally-ordered routing algorithm (TORA).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13685/00631180.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1413 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.631180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly adaptive distributed routing algorithm for mobile wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Routing protocols","Partitioning algorithms","Wireless application protocol","Mobile communication","Land mobile radio","Laboratories","Spread spectrum communication","Distributed algorithms","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","protocols","telecommunication network routing","distributed algorithms","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed routing algorithm","mobile wireless networks","multihop wireless networks","link reversal algorithms","temporally-ordered sequence","diffusing computations","directed link reversals","highly adaptive protocol","distributed algorithm","network partitions","topological change events","logical clock","physical clock","temporally-ordered routing algorithm","TORA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A highly adaptive distributed routing algorithm for mobile wireless networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5919868","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly adaptive distributed routing algorithm for mobile wireless networks","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00631180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073999S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"950","articleId":"631180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":631182,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This phenomenon is commonly observed on results produced by the conventional deterministic routing strategies using a single optimization cost function. Consequently, our results are significantly improved on both the number of routing tracks and routing segments by just applying low-complexity algorithms.

The special structure of modular products provides challenges and opportunities for the design of assembly systems. Given a family of modular products, designing low cost assembly systems is an important problem. In this paper, an approach for the design of assembly systems for modular products is proposed.

A scheme for detecting the occurrence and disappearance of smooth rotation is devised, and appropriate dynamic laws are employed to achieve selective stabilization. As a by product of the selective stabilization algorithm, 3-D locations of close feature points are estimated in a stabilized frame of reference, thus providing more useful structural information.

It presents a new approach toward the design of optimal robot excitation trajectories, and formulates the maximum-likelihood estimation of dynamic robot model parameters. The differences between the new design approach and the existing approaches lie in the parameterization of the excitation trajectory and in the optimization criterion. The excitation trajectory for each joint is a finite Fourier series. This approach guarantees periodic excitation which is advantageous because it allows: 1) time-domain data averaging; 2) estimation of the characteristics of the measurement noise, which is valuable in the case of maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. In addition, the use of finite Fourier series allows calculation of the joint velocities and acceleration in an analytic way from the measured position response, and allows specification of the bandwidth of the excitation trajectories. The optimization criterion is the uncertainty on the estimated parameters or a lower bound for it, instead of the often used condition of the parameter estimation problem. Simulations show that this criterion yields parameter estimates with smaller uncertainty bounds than trajectories optimized according to the classical criterion. Experiments on an industrial robot show that the presented trajectory design and maximum-likelihood parameter estimation approaches complement each other to make a practicable robot identification technique which yields accurate robot models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5728043","volume":"13","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal robot excitation and identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal robot excitation and identification","sourcePdf":"00631234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040828S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"340","articleId":"631234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":631238,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The infinity norm of a vector is its maximum absolute value component and hence its minimization implies the determination of a minimum effort solution as opposed to the minimum-energy criterion associated with the Euclidean norm. In applications where individual magnitudes of the vector components are of concern, this norm represents the physical requirements more closely than does the Euclidean norm. We first study the minimization of the infinity-norm of the joint velocity vector itself, and discuss its physical interpretation. Next, a new method of optimizing a subtask criterion, defined using the infinity-norm, to perform additional tasks such as obstacle avoidance or joint limit avoidance is introduced. Simulations illustrating these methods and comparing the results with the Euclidean norm solutions are presented.","doi":"10.1109/70.631238","startPage":"767","endPage":"775","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/13709/00631238.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.631238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum effort inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","H infinity control","Manipulators","Jacobian matrices","Orbital robotics","Arm","Optimization methods","Robots","Motion control","Kinetic energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics","redundancy","optimisation","Jacobian matrices","velocity control","duality (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse kinematics","redundant manipulators","optimization","redundant arms","infinity norm","joint velocity vector","obstacle avoidance","joint limit avoidance","Jacobian matrix","duality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Minimum effort inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5728047","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum effort inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators","sourcePdf":"00631238.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040269S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"87","articleId":"631238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":631268,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Ultrashort laser pulses offer both high laser intensity and precise laser-induced breakdown threshold with reduced laser fluence. The ablation of materials with ultrashort pulses has a very limited heat-affected volume. The advantages of ultrashort laser pulses are applied in precision micromachining of various materials. Some femtosecond laser pulse micromachining results, including comparison with long pulses, are presented. Ultrashort-pulse laser micromachining may have a wide range of applications where micrometer and submicrometer feature sizes are required.","doi":"10.1109/3.631270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/3/13706/00631270.pdf","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.631270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser ablation and micromachining with ultrashort laser pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Laser ablation and micromachining with ultrashort laser pulses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631270/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5719773","volume":"33","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser ablation and micromachining with ultrashort laser pulses","sourcePdf":"00631270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068426S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"624","articleId":"631270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":631274,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

The extensive design study, which covers the whole excitation process of the laser, focused on efficient laser operation at high average powers but also took into consideration the practicability of the laser device. For the first time, pumplight-induced absorptions in Ti:sapphire and their avoidance by appropriate filtering were investigated. The laser performance could be improved, firstly, due to the proper design of the discharge circuit, which resulted in an increased spectral overlap of the flashlamp-emission with the Ti:sapphire absorption. Secondly, the insight into the consequences of the flashlamp plasma reabsorption in conjunction with a small-spectral-band-transmitting pump-light filter led to a simple, experimentally confirmed transfer-efficiency reflector model and, based on this, to an improved reflector shape. As a result of the study, average powers of up to 220 W at a total laser efficiency of 2.25% have been achieved, Also, a single-pass small-signal gain of 3.1 and a total stored energy in the laser rod of 690 mJ at 100-Hz repetition rate could be demonstrated. This significant improvement over former flashlamp-pumped Ti:sapphire lasers and amplifiers for the first time opens up the possibility of femtosecond-pulse amplification to high average powers at 100 Hz repetition rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719792","volume":"33","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of a high-average-power flashlamp-pumped Ti:sapphire laser and amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of a high-average-power flashlamp-pumped Ti:sapphire laser and amplifier","sourcePdf":"00631292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051067S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"16","articleId":"631292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":631328,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

In the DMM approach to GA/MoM a \"mother\" impedance or Z-matrix is filled only once at the beginning of the optimization process, and then the GA optimizer operates on subsets of the original \"mother\" Z-matrix to perform the optimization. Application of DMM to the GA/MoM significantly reduces the total optimization time by eliminating multiple Z-matrix fill operations. The DMM also facilitates the use of matrix partitioning and pre-solving to further reduce the optimization time in many practical cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5828495","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and method of moments (GA/MoM): A novel integration for antenna design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and method of moments (GA/MoM): A novel integration for antenna design","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00631495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028822S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"9","articleId":"631495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":631498,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These parameters are the real and imaginery parts of the complex relative permittivity (/spl epsi/'/sub r/, /spl epsi/''/sub r/) and permeability (/spl mu/'/sub r/, u''/sub r/), and finally the thickness of the material. We also investigate the effect of the fabrication errors such as thickness, relative permeability and permittivity on the behaviour of the attenuation characteristics of the absorber, and also we try a proper design of the optimum point, to reduce these effects as much as possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5828506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Practical optimum design for a single-layer electromagnetic wave absorber at C and X-band using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical optimum design for a single-layer electromagnetic wave absorber at C and X-band using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00631506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03516S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"2","articleId":"631506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":631543,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This technique employs the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method to compute the scattering by large bodies and uses the finite-element method (FEM) to characterize the cracks and cavities. The two methods are combined through a coupling scheme based on the EM equivalence principle and the reciprocity theorem. The coupling scheme is designed in such a manner that it includes all significant interactions between the FEM and the SBR methods and it permits the SBR and FEM computations to be done separately. The resulting technique is efficient and accurate and, because of this, is extended to the calculation of the radiation patterns of conformal antennas in a complex environment (Greenwood et al. 1996). We further extend the hybrid FEM/SBR method and also develop a new hybrid method-of-moments (MoM)/SBR method to compute scattering by large bodies with small protruding scatterers. To be more specific, we first employ the field equivalence principle to replace the protruding scatterers by a set of equivalent electric and magnetic currents. The total scattered field then becomes the superposition of the field scattered by the large body without protrusions, which is calculated using the SBR method, and the field radiated by the equivalent currents in the presence of the large body, which is also calculated using the SBR method with the aid of the reciprocity theorem. The required equivalent currents are computed using the FEM of MoM, which permits the handling of complex material composition of the protrusions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

However, to the knowledge of the authors, it has found little or no interest up to now for a very special variety of radar systems: ground penetrating radars (GPR). The reason for this is the range at which the target is located. Due to the highly lossy media into which the wave propagates, the transmitting and receiving antennas are generally located close to the ground interface, for a maximum power transfer and a better signal reception. Objects at shallow depths cannot be considered to be in the far field. At the base of radar polarimetry is the scattering matrix which, unfortunately, is defined by the ratios of the scattered to the incident far fields components. Other results, have shown that the near field can be obtained easily using a standard FDTD computer code with some modifications. This paper goes a step further by explaining how to compute the far field scattering matrix and the polarimetric responses. The contribution of the interface to the polarimetric responses is also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarimetric responses of underground targets using an hybrid transfer function FDTD method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Several papers have appeared in which a large aperture is used in conjunction with thick substrates to increase the bandwidth of the element. This technique is quite robust, and bandwidths in excess of 50% have been realized. However, one disadvantage of this method is the large amount of radiation produced by the aperture, leading to a radiation pattern with a poor front-to-back ratio. One way to improve the front-to-back ratio is to place a microstrip antenna element behind the aperture as a reflector. The action of this element is akin to that in a Yagi-Uda dipole array. However, the incorporation of a reflector in an aperture coupled patch antenna is much easier to achieve. Proximity coupling between the feedline and the reflecting element is negligible due to the thick foam substrate used, allowing the use of the reciprocity method of analysis. Also, the directive patch elements are shielded from the reflector by the ground plane. Therefore, only interactions between the reflector and the aperture need to be modelled, resulting in a simple analysis. For aperture coupled patch designs with a front-to-back ratio of 10 dB or greater, the introduction of a reflecting element has a negligible effect on the input impedance of the antenna. Therefore, a reflector element can readily be incorporated into existing designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5835309","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Reflector elements for aperture and aperture coupled microstrip antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflector elements for aperture and aperture coupled microstrip antennas","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00631620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046709S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"15","articleId":"631620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":631627,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Due to the relative simplicity of this hardware this method of predistortion may well find application in both the base station and the mobile part of a radio communication system.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19970697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19970697","startPage":"6/1","endPage":"6/6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on RF and Microwave Components for Communication Systems(Digest No: 1997/126)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4994/13711/00631627.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on RF and Microwave Components for Communication Systems(Digest No: 1997/126)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power amplifier linearisation using predistortion techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"23 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifier linearisation using predistortion techniques","conferenceDate":"23-23 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5622969","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/631627/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifier linearisation using predistortion techniques","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"00631627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021634S","chronDate":"23 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13711","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4994","citationCount":"8","articleId":"631627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":631628,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Two techniques for mesh termination have emerged that succeed in bringing the artificial reflections generated from the terminal boundaries of FDTD space to unprecedented low levels. These two techniques are the perfectly matched layer (PML) introduced by Berenger (1994) and the complementary operators method (COM) introduced by Ramahi (1995). No direct comparison between the two techniques has yet been published. In this paper, an evaluation and comparison of these two techniques is presented that is based on a numerical experiment which has been discussed in the literature (Ramahi). Here, the primary factors in the comparison are: accuracy, memory overhead and operations count. Although this example gives numerical data, it is still intended to give primarily a qualitative perspective on the relative performance of the two techniques. The example demonstrates that COM provides comparable accuracy to that obtained by an 18-layer PML, while requiring less memory and fewer operations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison and evaluation of the PML and COM mesh truncation techniques for FDTD simulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Usually, dosimetric measurement systems incorporating liquid filled head phantoms are used to evaluate the near-field characteristics, and free-space ranges or anechoic chambers for measurements of the far-field antenna radiation properties. However, due to the progress in the computer area, it is now possible to use numerical techniques for studying the electromagnetic fields radiated by a mobile phone. Above all, the FDTD method has offered a powerful approach in analyzing both the near-field and far-field situations with realistic body models. The aim of this study has been to compare the results from measurements and corresponding FDTD calculations of both the far-fields and near-fields emitted by mobile phones when the phone is standing free of surrounding objects and when it is placed in the close proximity of a head phantom.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

A difficult problem is separating the interaction between the source excitation and the time domain reflections. In a previous paper Luebbers and Langdon (see IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol.44, no.7, p.1535-9, 1996) presented the idea of a voltage source with an internal source resistance as a means for exciting a microstrip patch antenna. The resistive source feed also allows one to position the feed very close to the structure, thereby reducing the number of cells and computer memory needed. In addition the number of time steps needed can be drastically reduced, especially for a resonant structure. We extend the resistive source approach to the calculation of multiport S parameters. Each FDTD calculation determines one column of the matrix. For example, if port 1 is excited then that calculation provides S/sub 11/, S/sub 21/, \"...\", S/sub N1/.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FDTD calculation of multi-port S parameters for microstrip and stripline circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

The FDTD technique is based on the finite difference approximations of Maxwell's differential equations in both spatial field arrangements and time difference. Since the storage space available for computed fields in computers is finite, there is a need to truncate the problem space using absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) that simulate continuous wave propagation on the truncation interfaces. Many ABCs have been introduced in the last few years; however, there is no reflectionless absorbing boundary. Two and three dimensional numerical absorbers, matched layers (ML) similar to those presented by Holland and Williams (1983) and by Reineix and Jecko (1989), and Yee's tapered damping function ABC are presented and critically evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.631710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

This paper focuses on the application of fractal geometric concepts to the analysis and design of thinned fractal linear as well as planar arrays. There are many applications where it is advantageous to apply thinning techniques to the design of antenna arrays (Lo, 1988). In this paper, we approach thinning with the sole purpose of arranging the elements in a fractal pattern to investigate the usefulness of fractal array designs. In particular, the multiscaling of the fractal makes them attractive for wideband applications. Another advantage of these fractal arrays is that the self-similarity in their geometrical structure may be exploited in order to develop algorithms for rapid computation of radiation patterns. These algorithms are based on convenient product representations for the array factors and are much quicker to calculate than the discrete Fourier transform approach. Results for both the Canter linear array and the Sierpinski carpet planar array are presented.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.631722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

In designing microcell systems there is a often a desire to have a good understanding of the propagation characteristics within the cell. Site-specific models offer a fast and inexpensive means of obtaining this information without the need for on-site measurements. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method was initially developed by Yee in 1966. The method is commonly applied to three-dimensional scattering and radiation problems. But with the exception of analyzing the propagation within a single room, even the largest computers do not have nearly enough memory to model full three-dimensional indoor or outdoor propagation problems. However, in many cases a two-dimensional approximation to the geometry can be used, and two-dimensional FDTD has previously been applied to indoor propagation. This paper considers the application of 2D FDTD to a simple outdoor environment and develops a simple approach for introducing the correct spherical wave spreading. Comparisons to FDTD predictions could be used to evaluate and refine the GTD based methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

This formulation is based on an integral equation in which the unknown function is the difference between the exact current distribution on the truncated array and the current distribution pertinent to an infinite array. This unknown function can be associated to the field diffracted at the edge of the array by the Floquet modes of the infinite array.

A technique which was proposed previously, accounts for the edge effects by a windowing approach, which is based on a physical optics (PO)-type approximation and on the active Green's function concept. This latter terminology denotes the near-field radiated by a finite array of elementary sources. To efficiently calculate the active free-space Green's function, a Floquet waves (FWs) representation may be used. This representation allows one to interpret the radiation (or scattering) of a finite phased array as a superposition of FW distributions on the global aperture of the array. Consequently, each FW radiation integral can be asymptotically represented by the FWs themselves plus ray contributions from the edge of the array. In this paper the Green's function of an array of dipoles which is truncated in one dimension and infinite in the other is formulated. The dipoles are considered of uniform amplitude and linearly phased for including a scan beam description. By invoking the locality of the high-frequency phenomena, the actual finite distribution may be treated by using local edges. The problem is firstly formulated by superimposing the near field contributions of each source. Next, the global radiation from the structure is represented in terms of a spectral integral which is asymptotically evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.631744","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1081 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

An adaptive discretization scheme is proposed and found more effective than the conventional equal-space discretization scheme.

Transverse electromagnetic (TEM) transmission cells are widely used for exposing cell cultures to uniform TEM fields and quantifying the biological effects. The uniformity of exposure is critical to quantifying the response versus dose of any observed biological effect. Standing waves and other electromagnetic field nonuniformities can lead to a nonuniform exposure. The use of field or temperature probes to monitor exposure within the cell culture is not easy. First, the presence of measurement probes perturbs the field distribution. Second, the heat diffusion process is fast, especially within small cell culture Petri dishes. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method provides a highly accurate means for quantifying electromagnetic field exposure levels within the culture cells. Further, given the FDTD-computed electric and magnetic field distribution throughout the TEM cell, the specific absorption rate (SAR) can be calculated at each grid point within the cell culture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform exposures of Petri dish cultures within a TEM cell identified by FDTD modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

The conformal PML design appears to be useful in reducing the white space in the computational domain of the FEM. Analytical solutions have shown that it is possible to locate the PML arbitrarily close to the surface of a convex, electrically-large scatterer. This leads to the conclusion that the conformal PML is very effective for mesh truncation, especially at high frequencies. The PML concept is applicable not only to electromagnetic propagation problems described by the vector wave equation, but also to applications governed by the scalar Helmholtz equation. This, in turn, implies that PML absorbers can be used for acoustic scattering or radiation problems as well. The tensor constitutive parameters of a perfectly-matched anisotropic medium must satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relationships, such that the dynamical system governed by the constitutive relations is causal. A causal PML design ensures a better performance over the entire frequency spectrum. In the past, the perfectly-matched absorbers have been employed in FDTD and FEM applications. However, it seems feasible to use them for FETD mesh truncation as well. A causal/conformal PML design seems to offer an optimal solution to effective mesh truncation over a wider band of frequencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review of some recent advances in perfectly-matched absorbers for mesh truncation in FEM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

In fact, we can safely state that over the past 10 years, the greatest progress in computational electromagnetics has been on the development and application of partial differential equation (PDE) methods such as the finite difference-time domain and finite element (FEM) methods, including hybridizations of these with integral equation and high frequency techniques. The major reasons for the increasing reliance on PDE methods stem from their inherent geometrical adaptability, low O(N) memory demand and their capability to model heterogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) geometries. These attributes are essential in developing general-purpose codes for electromagnetic analysis/design, including antenna design and characterization. At the University of Michigan we have developed a variety of hybrid finite element implementations which vary in capability from very fast and specialized to general-purpose codes for antennas analysis. Typical complexity of the antenna geometries is depicted and some specific applications are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.631814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Therefore, closed form solutions that exist in the real coordinate system map to solutions in the complex coordinate system. In the complex coordinate system, the boundaries exist in a complex space, providing absorbing boundary conditions. Hence, this transformation provides a new view of PML in the Cartesian coordinates, clearly showing that a mapping to a complex coordinate system does not induce reflections, explaining why PML works near the corner of a simulation region, and when a dielectric interface, or a metallic surface, extends to the edge of a simulation region.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Such dominant points carry useful information for shape analysis and pattern recognition applications since they represent a local shape property and segment object contours into piecewise linear segments and circular arcs. The proposed architecture implements an algorithm based on the curvature primal sketch. It consists of a set of 1D systolic FIR filters performing a multiresolution analysis of the scene's object contours, a set of finite-state-machines extracting zero-crossings and extrema of the filtered data, and a set of scale-space integration cells combining the accurate locations provided by the finest filters with the noise rejection properties of the coarsest ones in order to reliably extract relevant dominant points with accurate localization. The overall architecture has been successfully implemented and integrated to a custom machine vision system with real-time edge-extraction and edge-tracking capabilities. Some experimental results obtained using this system are presented and discussed. Performance issues are also addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception.

It plays a key role in image understanding. Geometric hashing has been proposed as a technique for model-based object recognition in occluded scenes. However, parallel techniques are needed to realize real-time vision systems employing geometric hashing. In this paper, we develop a design technique for parallelizing geometric hashing on an FPGA-based platform. We first transform the hash table which contains symbolic data into a bit-level representation. By regularizing the data flow and exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware, our design achieves high performance. Using our approach, given a scene consisting of 256 feature points, a probe can be performed in 1.65 milliseconds on an FPGA-based platform having 32 Xilinx 4062s. In earlier implementations, the same probe operation was performed in 240 milliseconds on a 32K-node CM2 and in 382 milliseconds on a 32-node CM5. Also, the same operation takes 40 milliseconds on a 32-node IBM SP-2. By parameterizing the application and the device characteristics, we derive an area-time efficient design based on these parameters. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to many geometric hashing methods and is portable to other FPGA devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Concurrent computing","Layout","Probes","Solid modeling","Real time systems","Machine vision","Parallel processing","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","field programmable gate arrays","computer vision","file organisation","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel object recognition","FPGA-based configurable computing platform","image understanding","geometric hashing","model-based object recognition","occluded scenes","real-time vision systems","hash table","bit-level representation","bit-level parallelism","area-time efficient design","FPGA devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=631928","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1997.631928","startPage":"143","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception.

Many media content owners are concerned about the potential loss of revenue from multimedia piracy, especially when the content will be exposed to the Internet. Digital watermarking is seen by many as a potential solution to this problem. Many different watermarking schemes have been proposed. Often, however there is little discussion of how effective a proposed watermarking technique may be at solving a particular problem. We describe a number of proposed image-watermarking application scenarios and form a small number of watermark-application categories.

Affine invariance is obtained by a representation which is based on a new sampling configuration in the frequency domain. We discuss the decomposition of affine transform into slant, tilt, swing, scale and 2D translation by applying singular value decomposition (SVD). The affine invariant spectral signatures (AISS) are derived from a set of Cartesian logarithmic-logarithmic (log-log) sampling configuration in the frequency domain. The AISS enables the recognition of image patches that correspond to roughly planar object surfaces-regardless of their poses in space. Unlike previous log-polar representations which are not invariant to slant (i.e. foreshortening only in one direction), the AISS yields a complete affine invariance. The proposed log-log configuration can be employed either by a global Fourier transform or by a local Gabor transform. Local representation enables one to recognize separately several objects in the same image. The actual signature recognition is performed by multi-dimensional indexing in a pictorial dataset. 3D pose information is also derived as a by-product.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632037","startPage":"162","endPage":"165 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632037.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVD and log-log frequency sampling with Gabor kernels for invariant pictorial recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"SVD and log-log frequency sampling with Gabor kernels for invariant pictorial recognition","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5906510","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632037/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVD and log-log frequency sampling with Gabor kernels for invariant pictorial recognition","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036806S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"4","articleId":"632037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":632047,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Edge linking as a post-processing step is an important step for computer vision and pattern recognition. We present a real-time algorithm and its VLSI implementation for linking broken edges. First, all broken edge points inside a 12/spl times/12 moving window are identified. The 12/spl times/12 window scans the input gray level edge map converting it into three levels of intensities using two threshold values. Decisions of linking the stronger edge break points are made based on their directions and/or with the guidance of the weak edge lines. The proposed VLSI architecture is capable of running the proposed edge linking algorithm in real-time outputting one pixel of the linking edge map per clock cycle with a latency of 11n+12 clock cycles, where n is the number of pixel columns in the image.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Very large scale integration","Pixel","Clocks","Delay","Statistics","Image edge detection","Pattern recognition","Object recognition","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","real-time systems","VLSI","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge linking algorithm","VLSI implementation","edge detection","post-processing step","computer vision","pattern recognition","real-time algorithm","real-time","VLSI architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632055","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1997.632055","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception.

Compared with the conventional subband energy-based distance measure for wavelets coefficients of images, our method yields on average about a 6% to 8% higher texture retrieval rate for an image database of 97 textures.

Since the smoothness constraint may be inconsistent with the brightness constraint, a smoothing parameter is introduced to control the tradeoff between satisfying the requirements of both constraints. Previously, there have only been heuristic discussions on how to choose the smoothing parameter. We show that the choice of the smoothing parameter can have a significant effect on the flow estimate and present a data-driven method based on estimated risk to select the smoothing parameter in the Horn and Schunck (1981) algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632117","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632117.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"363 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven method for choosing smoothing parameters in optical flow problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven method for choosing smoothing parameters in optical flow problems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5906559","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven method for choosing smoothing parameters in optical flow problems","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041212S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"17","articleId":"632117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":632135,"authors":[{"name":"Xuli Zong","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Xuli Zong","id":"37087534858"},{"name":"A.

The algorithm is applied to identify regions of masses in mammographic images of varied degrees of perceptual difficulty. Each mammographic image is first decomposed into overcomplete wavelet representations of sub-octave frequency bands. A feature vector for each pixel through the scale space is constructed from fine to coarse scales. The feature vectors are used to drive a neural network classifier of dynamic resource allocation for segmentation. Sub-octave wavelet representations have an improved capability of characterizing subtle (band-limited) features frequently seen in mammographic images. A radial basis network of dynamic resource allocation is shown to have better adaptation and generalization in a redundant feature space. Experimental results along with statistical analysis are partially compared to a traditional classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632135","startPage":"400","endPage":"403 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632135.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale segmentation through a radial basis neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image segmentation","Wavelet transforms","Resource management","Wavelet analysis","Statistical analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer networks","Information science","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","feedforward neural nets","diagnostic radiography","wavelet transforms","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale segmentation","radial basis neural network","image segmentation","sub-octave wavelet representations","dynamic resource-allocating neural network","algorithm","mammographic images","perceptual difficulty","sub-octave frequency bands","feature vector","neural network classifier","dynamic resource allocation","redundant feature space","statistical analysis","breast cancer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale segmentation through a radial basis neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5906569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale segmentation through a radial basis neural network","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061987S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"3","articleId":"632135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":632142,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Eun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Eun Kim","id":"37087310367"},{"name":"Sun-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sun-Ho Lee","id":"37087356020"},{"name":"Seok-Hyun Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seok-Hyun Ryu","id":"37087532556"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Soo Choi","id":"37087145996"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8183-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"632142","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Reflectivity","Neural networks","Light sources","Lighting","Optical reflection","Image reconstruction","Surface reconstruction","Image segmentation","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","image recognition","reflectivity","image segmentation","image representation","image reconstruction","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape recovery","hybrid reflectance surface","neural network","shading","Lambertian surface","diffuse reflectance surface","natural objects","intensity distribution","diffuse illumination","segmented region","sphere surface","training set","intensity disparities","Torrance-Sparrow style reflectance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632142","abstract":"The main interest of previous researches for shape from shading was only on a Lambertian surface which consists of a diffuse reflectance surface. In practice, natural objects have hybrid reflectance, which limits the recovery of shape from intensity distribution. In this paper, we propose the method of determining shape using a neural network and diffuse illumination. The segmented region of sphere surface is used for a training set, which can be determined by shadow line and edge of surface. Diffuse illumination is used to avoid specular spike and highlight which usually cause many problems such as intensity disparities. The diffuse illumination method using flat paper allows us to reduce these phenomena with a simple scheme. The neural network and diffuse illumination method are useful for shape from shading, because it can be applied to objects of unknown reflectance properties, but it is applied only to Torrance-Sparrow style reflectance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632142","startPage":"416","endPage":"419 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632142.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape recovery of hybrid reflectance surface using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632142/","displayDocTitle":"Shape recovery of hybrid reflectance surface using neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5906572","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape recovery of hybrid reflectance surface using neural network","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA","sourcePdf":"00632142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045247S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"3","articleId":"632142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":632146,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we propose an efficient PIT scheme in which two-channel conjugate classified vector quantization (TCCVQ) is applied to the subvectors formed from the classified wavelet transform blocks. The use of these two techniques allows efficient bit-rate reduction and reduces coding artifacts (i.e., blocking effects and distorted edges) at low bit rates. The adaptive classification technique is utilized to classify an image into four perceptually distinct categories. Simulation results show that the first stage image already provides a useful approximation and reconstructed images, at the intermediate levels, preserve fine and pleasant qualities based on both subjective and mean square error criteria compared to other schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632186.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"578 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive transmission of images using block wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Frequency","Spatial resolution","Image reconstruction","Image communication","Bit rate","Discrete transforms","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","wavelet transforms","transform coding","vector quantisation","image classification","image reconstruction","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block wavelet transform","progressive image transmission","two-channel conjugate classified vector quantization","subvectors","classified wavelet transform blocks","efficient bit-rate reduction","coding artifacts reduction","low bit rates","adaptive classification technique","image classification","subjective quality","mean square error criteria","image coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Progressive transmission of images using block wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5906610","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive transmission of images using block wavelet transform","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051165S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"1","articleId":"632186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":632192,"authors":[{"name":"Ut-Va Koc","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ut-Va","lastName":"Koc","id":"37272601200"},{"name":"K.J.

Moreover, it can also achieve 20 times speed up when the MSE performance is kept close to the well-known three-step search.

This method is potentially useful in a variety of situations, but we focus here on an area of great interest to us- its application to the problem of video compression from remote airborne platforms. While the basic idea is conceptually similar to the pan compensation proposed by Taubman and Zakhor for their 3D subband coder, our method continually tracks and updates the image in the feedback loop in the same way as a conventional hybrid system. Using both residual energy and reconstruction error as metrics, we show that the new motion compensation scheme compares very favorably to the conventional one.

Simulation results show improvements over standard 2-D mesh motion compensation at a fraction of computational increase.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632204.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"649 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive interpolation scheme for 2-D mesh motion compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Motion compensation","Tracking","Motion estimation","Educational institutions","Mesh generation","Computational modeling","Bit rate","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","motion compensation","motion estimation","adaptive signal processing","video codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive interpolation scheme","2D mesh motion compensation","blocking free prediction","block matching motion compensation","smooth full motion field","node motion vectors","moving object boundaries","motion discontinuities","simulation","computational increase","video codec"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive interpolation scheme for 2-D mesh motion compensation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5906627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive interpolation scheme for 2-D mesh motion compensation","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043817S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"3","articleId":"632204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":632207,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The only characteristic of transform imagery utilised is that of energy clustering in frequency and in space. Two variants of the coding method are considered for image compression. One gives a hierarchical image code when employed with a discrete wavelet transform, while the other is suitable for block based coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple and efficient hierarchical image coder","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.632207","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/13718/00632207.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"661 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.632207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A simple and efficient hierarchical image coder","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5912152","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple and efficient hierarchical image coder","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105583S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"29","articleId":"632207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":632226,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

This paper extends previous work (Collard et al., 1996) related to the use of meta-genes in the so-called dual genetic algorithms (DGAs). A more generic framework, involving a variable number of genes, is introduced. Folding genetic algorithms are thus proposed as a new class of genetic algorithms, whose effectiveness is investigated on two well-known models of dynamical environments and compared to simple genetic algorithms and DGAs. Eventually, further analysis of these results enlightens the ability of FGAs to evolve a metric over the search space (i.e. a kind of encoding scheme) along with potential solutions. These particularly encouraging results open up interesting perspectives, as FGAs could be applied to to other fundamental problems investigated by the genetic algorithms community in order to measure the benefits of this really meta-level of evolution.","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1997.632246","pdfPath":"/iel3/4999/13719/00632246.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1997.632246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time dependent optimization with a folding genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Time dependent optimization with a folding genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5774772","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"3-8 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time dependent optimization with a folding genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00632246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026837S","chronDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4999","citationCount":"6","articleId":"632246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":632256,"authors":[{"name":"Bong-Su Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bong-Su Kang","id":"37087951528"},{"name":"Sung-Il Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Il Chien","id":"37087170455"},{"name":"Kil-Taek Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kil-Taek Lim","id":"37087619406"},{"name":"Jin-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Kyung Hee University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Ho Kim","id":"37087200296"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8203-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"632256","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632256","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Databases","Character recognition","Iris","Merging","Cities and towns","Hierarchical systems","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","character sets","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","self-organising feature maps","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale pattern recognition system","hierarchical neural network","false-alarming nodes","multilingual character recognition","preclassification mode","fine recognition mode","self-organizing feature map learning","modifying steps","clusters","multilayer perceptron networks","output layer","error-prone negative examples","topology-preserving mapping","printed Korean/Chinese character database","IRIS database"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAI.1997.632256","pdfPath":"/iel3/4999/13719/00632256.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1997.632256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scale pattern recognition system using hierarchical neural network and false-alarming nodes","abstract":"A hierarchical neural network was studied for large scale pattern recognition problems such as multilingual character recognition.

Tests have shown that a very effective attitude estimation system can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/INES.1997.632450","startPage":"391","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/5001/13721/00632450.pdf","endPage":"395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INES.1997.632450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632450/","displayDocTitle":"A low-cost and low-weight attitude estimation system for an autonomous helicopter","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5787082","publicationDate":"1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-cost and low-weight attitude estimation system for an autonomous helicopter","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"00632450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026136S","chronDate":"15-17 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5001","citationCount":"106","articleId":"632450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":632501,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The novel detection scheme cancels the interference from the other users by taking into account reliability information about the detected interference. For this purpose, we do not use the decisions from the inner decoder (despreader) but the more reliable soft-values from the outer soft-in/soft-out decoder to reduce error propagation. It can be shown that the iterative soft-interference cancellation scheme clearly outperforms an MC-CDMA system with inner joint detection based on maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) which is followed by an outer channel decoder. Furthermore, the bit error rate (BER) obtained with the proposed scheme closely approaches the single-user bound. Hence, iterative soft-interference cancellation is able to eliminate almost all multiple access interference.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Iterative decoding","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Maximum likelihood decoding","Interference cancellation","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bit error rate","Multiuser detection","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","iterative methods","decoding","fading","Rayleigh channels","land mobile radio","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-carrier CDMA","iterative decoding","soft-interference cancellation","multi-user detection scheme","code division multiple access systems","reliability","outer soft-in/soft-out decoder","error propagation","iterative soft-interference cancellation scheme","inner joint detection","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","outer channel decoder","bit error rate","single-user bound","multiple access interference","mobile radio system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632502","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632502","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The amount of CFO which creates a given performance degradation depends on the number of channels, the SNR and the pulse shaping. In this contribution we will compare the common OFDM scheme, which uses M-QAM and square pulses, with an OFDM scheme which uses M-Offset QAM (M-OQAM) and pulses of finite duration with minimized excess band-width power. Both systems use an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Calculations and simulations show that the system with pulse shaping allows significantly higher CFO than the system utilising QAM and square pulses.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The effects of the first linearization loop on the effective IMD cancellation performance are compared to those of the second linearization loop and then the influences of an error amplifier on the effective IMD cancellation performance are analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Radio transmitters","Delay effects","Nonlinear distortion","Bandwidth","Digital modulation","Mobile communication","High power amplifiers","Delay lines","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","intermodulation distortion","interference suppression","linearisation techniques","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancellation performance","feedforward amplifier","IMD","inter-modulation distortion","amplitude imbalance","phase imbalance","delay mismatch","linearization loop","linearization bandwidth","first linearization loop","second linearization loop","error amplifier","radio transmitter power amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632515","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The binary input data to a rate 1/M encoder produces M coded bits, which, in turn, are assigned to M different antennas and transmitted from each antenna simultaneously. An intentional delay of several chips duration is introduced at each antenna before transmission, which enables a receiver to distinguish the signals from different antennas. Because the proposed scheme utilizes spatial and time domains for coding, it can achieve not only implicit time-diversity through the use of coding with interleaving, but also space-diversity through the transmission from multiple antennas. Multi-antenna schemes with convolutional codes can perform better than conventional single antenna schemes with the same codes and transmission diversity technique with the same number of transmitting antennas, especially when a fading is relatively slow and interleaving size is limited.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutionally coded DS/CDMA system using multi-antenna transmission","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

First, the reverse link interference from each tier to the center cell is calculated separately, Then, interference ratio of reverse links in a WLL system is analytically derived as a function of total tier number. The result shows that interference from other cells is proportional to the beam width of the house antenna. We also found that tier number plays a vital role in system capacity in a free-space propagation (20 dB/dec) environment. A WLL simulator is also built to verify our analytical solution.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632520","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97. IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference.

The simplest receiver is the correlation receiver but its performance deteriorates rapidly as the number of users increases. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a better receiver structure for such systems. Many multiuser detection schemes have been proposed. However, multiuser detectors require knowledge of some parameters such as the signature sequence of other users. It would thus be a great advantage if this requirement can be removed. In this paper, we propose a blind receiver that does not require knowledge of the users' system parameters except for those of the desired user. Thereby, significant reduction of the receiver complexity is possible. Performance of the proposed receiver is investigated and comparison of several receivers for OCDMA systems is also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind receiver for optical code division multiple access communications systems","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Original theoretical results are presented for a system operating at a bit rate of 622 Mbit/s and a wavelength of 1.53 /spl mu/m. By using a suboptimal matched filter approach and assuming thermal noise dominant conditions, the results demonstrate that the system offers 7.5 dB sensitivity improvement over a homodyne PPM system and 9.4 dB improvement over PSK homodyne. The system investigated also offers a 10.4 dB sensitivity improvement over an equivalent optically preamplified direct detection (DD) PPM system. It was also demonstrated that by using an optical filter in order to reduce the ASE noise the improvement in receiver sensitivity was only 0.3 dB.

An algorithm for the generation of information carrying OFDM signals with very low CF is presented. Such signals allow for the use of OFDM modulation together with power efficient amplifiers without causing out-of-band energy due to transmitter saturation. Since the complexity of the algorithm is completely located at the transmitter side, the proposed scheme is especially suitable for broadcasting services. The cost for the reduced CF is a certain loss in data rate, which can be varied by a parameter of the method. For example, in the case of only 25 percent loss in data rate a CF lower than 2.11 can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97. IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference.

Two-branch diversity reception and channel coding are included in the comparison. The coherent system uses a rate 1/2, 64-state convolutional code and includes a relatively high amount of pilot symbol overhead to facilitate the measurement of channel state information (CSI) including the instantaneous co-channel interference level. The CSI is incorporated in the combining and decoding process to improve the decoded bit error rate performance. Although the differential system does not support the measurement of the co-channel interference level, the savings in pilot symbol overhead enables the use of a more powerful rate 1/3, 64-state convolutional code. By using a rate 1/2 code in the CSI-coherent system and a rate 1/3 code in the differential system, the information data rates of the two systems are similar. Results indicate that CSI-coherent system performs better than the differential system due to the inclusion of accurate CSI in the combining and decoding process.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Spreading the information over many subcarriers adds flexibility to the system and a redundancy between subcarriers that can be combined with the derived frequency diversity from the fading channel. The performance of an MC-CDMA scheme over frequency selective, slowly fading channels is studied analytically and by computer simulations. The MC-CDMA system uses a BPSK modulation, quadrature (complex) spreading codes, and a simple correlator receiver. Quadrature spreading codes are used to reduce the effect of the multipath fading channel and restore some of the orthogonality losses between users. The obtained results show considerable performance improvement compared to the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and MC-CDMA schemes that use non-quadrature spreading. The effect of frequency offsets on the system performance is also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632561","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97. IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference.

The ZIFZCD is applied to /spl pi//4-differential quadrature phase shift keying (/spl pi//4-DQPSK), and the bit error rate (BER) performance of the ZIFZCD under a static channel is compared with three conventional detection schemes. The simulation results show that the BER performance of 8-axes ZIFZCD is almost 2 dB worse than that of the limiter discriminator integrate and dump (LDI). This is mainly due to the nonconstant envelope property of the /spl pi//4-DQPSK. However, if the ZIFZCD is applied to the constant envelope angle modulation, e.g., minimum shift keying (MSK) and Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK), then the BER of the ZIFZCD is comparable with conventional detection schemes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632568","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Its application in effecting receiver diversity is demonstrated by predicting required antenna separation for a given level of performance. It is shown that once the optimal antenna separation is achieved for a given geometric parameter set, the performance does not change much by increasing the antenna separation further. The properties of the cross-correlation with respect to the variation of geometric parameters, which include the scatterer ring size and the mobile position, are examined by investigating the analytical bit error performance of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation under the perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A space-time model for frequency nonselective Rayleigh fading channels with applications","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Traditional systems which use frequency division channels and guard bands waste useful spectrum. By using antenna array techniques, subscribers can communicate through frequency overlapped channels but still have satisfied performance. A practical system that uses 2-fold OCT to increase system capacities with the same total bandwidth is proposed along with an optimal beamforming algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed blind beamforming algorithm almost achieves the Wiener solution and converges very fast within 40 iterations. We also discuss the beamforming performance when more than 2-fold overlapped channels are applied.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632576","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632576","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The unlicensed spectrum (PCS band at 2 GHz, the National Information Infrastructure (NII) band at 5 GHz, and the millimeter wave band at 59-64 GHz) offers several benefits, but there are serious challenges to overcome before these benefits can be fully realized. Foremost among these is the risk of inefficient utilization, resulting from a lack of incentive to conserve the shared spectrum.

The development of accurate, reliable and economically realizable synchronization algorithms is a challenging problem with significant impact on overall system design and performance. The method of loop timing is used for synchronizing multiple remote units with a single head-end. Each remote transceiver blindly recovers downstream timing and uses it to derive its upstream clock. The issue of overcoming frequency offsets incurred on the cable network is addressed. A novel two-stage search and acquisition procedure comprising of all-digital baseband synchronization algorithms is described.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.632590","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The ILMs are developed to provide application-based motivation for learning, present fundamental concepts using animation and visualization and provide interactive practice on problem-solving and open-ended design experience. ILMs are now available on the 555 timer IC, an electrical engineering fundamentals handbook (EE handbook), an electronics circuit card manufacturing handbook, common-emitter amplifier design, analog filters, operational amplifiers, Fourier analysis and convolution. They are currently being used in introductory courses in circuits, electronics, instrumentation and signals and systems, all of which are moving to the studio format. Initial experiences by both faculty and students have been very positive.

The REU targets women and minorities, populations which typically suffer from low self-confidence and esteem, limited teamwork skills, and a lack of understanding about the \"rules of the game\". This paper shows that these activities were relatively easy to arrange and administer, and did not appear to distract the students from learning more traditional technical and research skills. The evaluation of the first year indicates that the professional and personal development activities were at least as important to the future success of the students as the research exercises.","doi":"10.1109/FIE.1997.632680","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Frontiers in Education 1997 27th Annual Conference.

Detector modules are made of LSO crystals (3 mm square by 30 mm deep)-the small module size and short decay time of LSO reduce the detector dead time by a factor of 14 compared to conventional EGO detector modules and narrow the coincidence window width to 4 ns. This yields an expected peak noise equivalent count rate of 800 kcps and noise equivalent sensitivity of 1370 kcps//spl mu/Ci/cc with a 20 cm diameter phantom-three to five times higher than conventional scanners. With 5 mm fwhm DOI resolution, the expected reconstructed spatial resolution is <3.0 mm fwhm throughout the entire field of view. Depth of interaction measurement information is incorporated into the reconstruction algorithm by rebinning onto a regularly spaced grid. Attenuation correction is performed with an orbiting single transmission source.","doi":"10.1109/23.632691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.632691","endPage":"1491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel3/23/13729/00632691.pdf","startPage":"1487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a high-resolution, high-sensitivity PET camera for human brains and small animals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632691/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a high-resolution, high-sensitivity PET camera for human brains and small animals","volume":"44","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5674637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a high-resolution, high-sensitivity PET camera for human brains and small animals","sourcePdf":"00632691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048113S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"59","articleId":"632691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":632766,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These tools have been used in several experiments both in academic and in industrial environments. Among other features, Circe can extract abstractions from natural language texts, build various models of the system described by the requirements, check the validity of such models, and produce functional metric reports.

To find these inputs by hand is extremely time-consuming, especially when the software is complex. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to automate the process. Random test data generation consists of generating test inputs at random, in the hope that they will exercise the desired software features. Often, the desired inputs must satisfy complex constraints, and this makes a random approach seem unlikely to succeed. In contrast, combinatorial optimization techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms, are meant to solve difficult problems involving the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints. In this paper, we discuss experiments with a test generation problem that is harder than the ones discussed in earlier literature-we use a larger program and more complex test adequacy criteria. We find a widening gap between a technique based on genetic algorithms and those based on random test generation.","doi":"10.1109/ASE.1997.632858","pdfPath":"/iel3/5003/13723/00632858.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"308","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 12th IEEE International Conference Automated Software Engineering","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 12th IEEE International Conference Automated Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE.1997.632858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for dynamic test data generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for dynamic test data generation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5781789","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for dynamic test data generation","confLoc":"Incline Village, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00632858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03609S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5003","citationCount":"40","articleId":"632858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":632877,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

With a rich cell library of predesigned, preverified circuit blocks, cores provide an attractive means to import technology to a system integrator and differentiate products by leveraging intellectual property advantages. Most importantly, core use shortens the time to market for new system designs through design reuse. Practical implementation of this design scenario, however, is fraught with unresolved issues: design methods for building single-chip systems, challenges in test and sign-off for these systems, and intellectual property licensing, protection, and liability. Here, we examine the evolving design flow for microelectronic systems, the market for core cells, and the challenges in using core cells for design, integration, assembly, and test of onchip systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/54/13735/00632877.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","doi":"10.1109/54.632877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/54.632877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing core-based system design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Intellectual property","System testing","System-on-a-chip","Libraries","Integrated circuit technology","Time to market","Design methodology","Licenses","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","printed circuit design","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core-based system design","PC board","system integrator","intellectual property","design reuse","intellectual property licensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct-Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct-Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Introducing core-based system design","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783311","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing core-based system design","sourcePdf":"00632877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061024S","chronDate":"Oct-Dec 1997","isNumber":"13735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"143","articleId":"632877","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":632882,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The several sampled circuits are implemented in 2/spl times/4 emitter-area HBT, 0.5 /spl mu/m MESFET and compatible 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS technologies. All the designed circuits are carefully simulated for the waveform at the output node and power consumption in the circuit. All waveform simulations showed good performance at 10 Gbps level. It is observed that 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS of current mainstream electronic systems shows more than 10 GHz level operation, opening an opportunity for high frequency use as long as deep sub-/spl mu/m technology compromises maturity and cost in reality. In terms of power consumption, the sub-0.5 /spl mu/m GaAs MESFET design was 4.2 mW and the best choice for the same 10 GHz speed performance, compared to 60 mW by the 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS circuit design.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEL.1997.632935","publicationTitle":"1997 21st International Conference on Microelectronics.

HFC CATV networks are shared medium access networks, employing the coaxial bus principle between an optical network terminator and the subscriber. To realize access in the upstream direction, a multiple access scheme based on CDMA can be used. However, before access is granted in the upstream direction, each cable modem connected to the coaxial bus needs to undergo a startup procedure at activation of the modem to determine timing and physical layer related settings. The initialization mechanism described performs time synchronization of a modem and the determination of the power the modem should use. Next to these physical layer settings, also the identity of a modem is determined during the initialization process.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel3/11/13739/00632953.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.632953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.632953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=632953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An initialisation protocol for a CDMA based communications scheme for HFC CATV networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Modems","Hybrid fiber coaxial cables","Access protocols","Coaxial components","Coaxial cables","Physical layer","Optical fiber communication","TV","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre subscriber loops","coaxial cables","cable television","code division multiple access","access protocols","modems","synchronisation","television antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HFC CATV networks","CDMA based communications","initialisation protocol","hybrid fiber coax networks","central antenna television networks","shared medium access networks","coaxial bus","optical network terminator","cable modem","multiple access scheme","upstream direction access","startup procedure","timing","physical layer related settings","initialization mechanism","time synchronization","modem power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"An initialisation protocol for a CDMA based communications scheme for HFC CATV networks","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5700647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An initialisation protocol for a CDMA based communications scheme for HFC CATV networks","sourcePdf":"00632953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026341S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"2","articleId":"632953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":632963,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Guo Zhang","affiliation":["Telecommunications Program School of Advanced Technologies, Asian Institute of Technology, Klong Luang, Thailand"],"lastName":"Jian-Guo Zhang","id":"37351706800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"632963","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Multiaccess communication","High speed optical techniques","Optical signal processing","Optical buffering","Optical design","Multimedia communication","Broadcasting","Bit rate","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical fibre networks","telecommunication channels","cable television","real-time systems","optical information processing","video coding","high definition television","entertainment","optical correlation","photonic switching systems","decoding","television networks","codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fiber CDMA networks","real-time multichannel video distributions","variable bit rate video distributions","code division multiple access","optical orthogonal codes","incoherent optical processing","video broadcasting","fast access tunability","bit rate flexibility","real-time VBR video distributions","entertainment HDTV applications","crosscorrelation constraint","autocorrelation constraint","high-speed photonic switching application","parallel-serial hybrid architecture","all-optical tunable decoders","all-optical tunable encoders","fast reconfiguration time","real-time video applications"]}],"abstract":"we design novel code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks which use strict optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) and incoherent optical processing for multichannel variable-bit-rate (VBR) video broadcasting.

In this structure, shortening of interconnection wires can be achieved, resulting in better performance and packing density. This analysis assumes an existing 3D channel routing methodology, based on the 2D channel routing methodology for standard-cell VLSI. The interconnection wire length in 3D and 2D structures is compared for several examples of systolic arrays. The experiments show that the average interconnection wire length in 3D structures is from 20% to 50% of the average interconnection wire length in 2D structures, depending on the number of active layers in 3D VLSI.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEL.1997.632973","publicationTitle":"1997 21st International Conference on Microelectronics.

In real situation, the complexity of the input data and/or of the computational procedure can make traditional error propagation methods infeasible. The new approach exploits a resampling technique recently introduced in statistics, the bootstrap. Distributions for the output variables are obtained by perturbing the nuisance properties of the input, i.e., properties with no relevance for the output under ideal conditions. From these bootstrap distributions, the confidence in the adequacy of the assumptions embedded into the computational procedure for the given input is derived. As an example, the new paradigm is applied to the task of edge detection. The performance of several edge detection methods is compared both for synthetic data and real images. The confidence in the output can be used to obtain an edgemap independent of the gradient magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/34.632979","startPage":"1185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/13736/00632979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.632979","endPage":"1198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment through bootstrap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment through bootstrap","volume":"19","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5783674","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment through bootstrap","sourcePdf":"00632979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075164S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"48","articleId":"632979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":632983,"authors":[{"name":"Song Chun Zhu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Song Chun Zhu","id":"37281407500"},{"name":"D.

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features.

The input can be in the form of points, or points with an associated tangent or normal, allowing both position and direction to be corrupted by noise. Most approaches treat the problem as an interpolation problem, which is solved by fitting a surface such as a membrane or thin plate to minimize some function. We argue that these physical constraints are not sufficient, and propose to impose additional perceptual constraints such as good continuity and \"cosurfacity\". These constraints allow us to not only infer surfaces, but also to detect surface orientation discontinuities, as well as junctions, all at the same time. The approach imposes no restriction on genus, number of discontinuities, number of objects, and is noniterative. The result is in the form of three dense saliency maps for surfaces, intersections between surfaces (i.e., 3D curves), and 3D junctions, respectively. These saliency maps are then used to guide a \"marching\" process to generate a description (e.g., a triangulated mesh) making information about surfaces, space curves, and 3D junctions explicit. The traditional marching process needs to be refined as the polarity of the surface orientation is not necessarily locally consistent. These three maps are currently not integrated, and this is the topic of our ongoing research. We present results on a variety of computer-generated and real data, having varying curvature, of different genus, and multiple objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","volume":"19","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Inference of surfaces, 3D curves, and junctions from sparse, noisy, 3D data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inference of surfaces, 3D curves, and junctions from sparse, noisy, 3D data","sourcePdf":"00632985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061008S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"131","articleId":"632985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":632990,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent.","doi":"10.1109/34.632990","startPage":"1300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/13736/00632990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.632990","endPage":"1305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint induction of shape features and tree classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/632990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Joint induction of shape features and tree classifiers","volume":"19","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5783685","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint induction of shape features and tree classifiers","sourcePdf":"00632990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045361S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"96","articleId":"632990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":632992,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Extensive use is made of sidebars and graphical presentation to facilitate understanding. The tutorial is followed by a discussion of several electromagnetic applications in which the GA has proven useful. The applications discussed include the design of lightweight, broadband microwave absorbers, the reduction of array sidelobes in thinned arrays, the design of shaped-beam antenna arrays, the extraction of natural resonance modes of radar targets from backscattered response data, and the design of broadband patch antennas. Genetic-algorithm optimization is shown to be suitable for optimizing a broad class of problems of interest to the electromagnetic community.

Prokhorov and D. Wunsch, 1996; R. Santiago, 1995; P. Werbos, 1994). This modification entails updating both the critic and the action networks at each computational cycle, rather than only one at a time. The distinction lies in the introduction of a (real) second copy of the critic network whose weights are adjusted less often and the \"desired value\" for training the other critic is obtained from this critic copy. Previously (G. Lendaris and C. Paintz, 1997), the proposed modified training strategy was demonstrated on the pole cart controller problem: the full 6 dimensional state vector was input to the critic and action NNs, however, the utility function only involved pole angle, not distance along the track (x). For the first set of results presented here, the 3 states associated with the x variable were eliminated from the inputs to the NNs, keeping the same utility function previously defined. This resulted in improved learning and controller performance. From this point, the method is applied to two additional problems, each of increasing complexity: for the first, an x-related term is added to the utility function for the pole cart problem, and simultaneously, the x-related states were added back in to the NNs (i.e., increase number of state variables used from 3 to 6); the second relates to steering a vehicle with independent drive motors on each wheel. The problem contexts and experimental results are provided.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Since the identification of important and/or redundant input parameters of a BPN leads to reduced size, shortened training time, and possibly more accurate results of the network, it is an issue of great practical as well as theoretical interests. We compare three different methods that have been proposed for identifying important inputs-sensitivity analysis, fuzzy curves, and change of MSE-and analyze their effectiveness on BPNs trained to model simple nonlinear functions as well as a real, production use network that has been built to model the cement bonding quality in a petroleum engineering application. Based on the analysis and our experience in building the BPN for predicting cement bonding quality, we also propose a general methodology for building BPNs in engineering applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633148/","accessionNumber":"5753509","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of neural network models for engineering problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of neural network models for engineering problems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00633148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031885S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4942","articleId":"633148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":633183,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Chang Lin","affiliation":["Communication Network Laboratory, Institute for Information Industry, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fang-Chang Lin","id":"37087180001"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4053-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"633183","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Robot kinematics","Biological cells","Evolution (biology)","Mobile robots","Sorting","Process design","Biological information theory","Pediatrics","Service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mobile robots","path planning","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multi-agent robotic systems coordination","object-sorting task","complex multi-agent task","agent-object sequence","performance evaluation","chromosome representation","distributed help model","centralized furniture mover model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633183","abstract":"This paper provides a genetic algorithm for solving the object-sorting task.

Simple steps are outlined for getting a neural network to model the system. The approach is illustrated by examples. An interesting example is a two tube model of the throat. Starting with an \"electrical engineering model\" of the glottis in the form of the Kelly-Lochbaum equations, an Overall Signal Flow diagram, we get: (a) the neural network layout directly; (b) the weights between various neural processing elements. The problem of designing the layout topology for optimum performance neural network has received much attention. Hence the importance of (a) which guarantees a network with the precisely the same characteristics as the electrical engineering model. If the electrical engineering model is optimum, then the derived ANN will be optimum. The model will give the steady state output wave resulting from a steady state glottal wave. The glottal wave can be obtained by a glottograph or by photoglottography. One can choose the glottograph because it interferes little with the speech process. The glottal wave thus obtained can test the model's ability to produce the corresponding speech wave. The N section tube model is lossless. From this it follows that it can be inverted to give the glottal wave given the speech wave. The inverted network may be able to act as a tool to investigate whether there is a reliable correlation between emotion of the speaker, such as fear, anger, even love, and the glottal wave.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633196/","accessionNumber":"5753534","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simple neural networks for speech research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple neural networks for speech research","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00633196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030322S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4942","citationCount":"3","articleId":"633196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":633202,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Adaptive combination schemes investigated included: four different neural net combiners and weighted voting optimized with a genetic algorithm. These different schemes were tested on the task of combining three neural network digit classifiers, identical in architecture but trained using different training sets.

The experimental result shows that the learning of four digitized training patterns is close to real time, and the recognition of the untrained patterns is above 90% correct. The ultra fast learning speed we achieved here is due to the non iterative nature of the novel learning scheme. The high robustness in recognition here is due to the optimal robustness analysis (including a special feature extraction process) we used in the neural network design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1997.633205","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The procedure includes: a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation technique for optimally selecting a retraining data set from the image applied to the network during real life operation; a decision mechanism for automatic activation of network retraining; and a neural network module which performs the classification task. The extracted feature set, used for retraining the network, can include additional elements compared to those used in the network initial training phase, so that it better fits the specific application data under consideration.

For representing 3-D surface shapes, 4th order B-spline functions are introduced as scaling functions of spline wavelets. A regularization problem is solved in order to estimate the surface function. The estimated surface function can be decomposed into an approximate surface function at specific lower resolution and the corresponding wavelet components by using the multiresolution wavelet transform. Consequently, by reducing the noise components which the wavelet components include, the surface recovery method can give a further accurate estimation of the surface function. Through several experiments, both the robustness to noises and the edge-preserving property in recovering the surface have been attained.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.633236","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The iiGA is a parallel GA in which a hierarchy of subpopulations of candidate problem solutions employ representations at different resolutions. Emigration from one subpopulation to another occurs strictly down the hierarchy of increasing resolution, except at the lowest (i.e. highest resolution) level where subpopulations can exchange migrants. This arrangement allows subpopulations with more abstract representations to evolve approximate solutions, which are then \"injected\" into subpopulations at lower levels in the hierarchy for further refinement. We investigate the application of the technique to artificial evolution of fuzzy controllers. In applying the technique to this problem, different subpopulations use varying levels of abstraction in their representation of fuzzy set membership functions and number of fuzzy rules.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633243/","accessionNumber":"5746043","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parallel evolutionary learning of fuzzy rule bases using the island injection genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel evolutionary learning of fuzzy rule bases using the island injection genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00633243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046351S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4942","citationCount":"2","articleId":"633243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":633275,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.F.

After image acquisition, moment invariants are calculated for each significant region in the input image. Different network sizes were tested for classifying these features and the authors compare these results with the traditional k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), for different k values. Hybrid strategies were adopted for training the networks. They used deterministic methods, such as conjugate gradient and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms, combined with a stochastic method, simulated annealing. The system deals with digital images with an unknown number of unoccluded object types and poses. Results show that, in this case, artificial neural networks had better generalization capability than k-NN; despite geometrical transformations and other degradations over the images. The systems runs on low cost personal computers and can therefore be easily adapted for use even by small factories.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.633275","startPage":"3872","endPage":"3877 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Such DACs have the potential to significantly increase the present precision limits of /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ data converters by eliminating the need for one-bit quantization in delta-sigma modulators. This paper extends the practicality of the noise-shaping DAC approach by presenting a general noise-shaping DAC architecture along with two special-case configurations that achieve first- and second-order noise-shaping, respectively. The second-order DAC configuration, in particular, is the least complex of those currently known to the author. Additionally, the paper provides a rigorous explanation of the apparent paradox of how the DAC noise can be spectrally shaped even though the sources of the DAC noise-the errors introduced by the analog circuitry-are not known to the noise-shaping algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/82.633435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.633435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/13746/00633435.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral shaping of circuit errors in digital-to-analog converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Spectral shaping of circuit errors in digital-to-analog converters","volume":"44","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5736455","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633435/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral shaping of circuit errors in digital-to-analog converters","sourcePdf":"00633435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068158S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"174","articleId":"633435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":633443,"authors":[{"name":"V.G.

The latency of the presented pipeline exponentiator, inverter, and divider is m(m-1) clock cycles. The cycle time (i.e., clock period) of the presented architectures is only two logic gate delays plus a short routing delay. For moderate values of m, say m/spl les/10, the circuit complexity of the presented circuits is realizable using presently available VLSI technology.

In addition, the normalization regarding power factor and total harmonic distortion (THD) makes it necessary to include power factor correction in the input stage in such architectures. This paper presents a novel approach of an integrated battery charger/discharger which offers power factor correction and battery galvanic isolation in a simple structure. Placing the battery in the primary side overcomes the need of galvanic isolation integration in each of the DC/DC on-board power converters when this topology is used as part of a distributed power supply system.","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/13741/00633453.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.633453","doi":"10.1109/41.633453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633453","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Galvanizing","Switches","Pulse width modulation converters","Circuits","Voltage","Irrigation","Reactive power","Topology","Pulsed power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","DC-DC power convertors","power factor correction","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","power supplies to apparatus","power MOSFET","field effect transistor switches","power field effect transistors","power semiconductor switches","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated battery charger/discharger topology","power factor correction","distributed power supply systems","total harmonic distortion","battery galvanic isolation","DC/DC on-board power converters","power MOSFET switches"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"An integrated battery charger/discharger with power-factor correction","accessionNumber":"5711378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated battery charger/discharger with power-factor correction","sourcePdf":"00633453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043262S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"40","articleId":"633453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":633461,"authors":[{"name":"Tsai-Fu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Applied Research Laboratory, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsai-Fu Wu","id":"37087142644"},{"name":"Te-Hung Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Applied Research Laboratory, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Te-Hung Yu","id":"37087289765"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"633461","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Switching converters","Electronic ballasts","Regulators","Power factor correction","Driver circuits","Reactive power","Lamps","Prototypes","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","power integrated circuits","switching circuits","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","power semiconductor diodes","power semiconductor switches","lamp accessories","fluorescent lamps","power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-stage power converters","offline applications","circuit synthesis","control strategies","input power factor correction","fast output regulation","lamp ballasting","compact size","simple driver design","reliability","electronic dimming ballasts","DC regulator","medium power applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-line applications with single-stage converters","doi":"10.1109/41.633461","startPage":"638","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/13741/00633461.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.633461","abstract":"Offline applications with single-stage power converters (SSCs) are presented in this paper.

An \"on-chip\" analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and PWM generator eliminate the external components needed to perform these functions. Implementation issues include limited on-chip program memory of 2 kB, unsigned integer arithmetic and computational delay. The duty cycle for the DC-DC power converter can only be updated every eight switching cycles because of the time required for the A/D conversion and the control calculations. However, it is demonstrated here that stable responses can be obtained for both buck and boost power converters under these conditions. Another important result is that the same microcontroller code, without any modifications, can control both power converters because their behavior can be described by the same set of linguistic rules. The contribution shows that a nonlinear controller such as fuzzy logic can be inexpensively implemented with microcontroller technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/13741/00633467.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.633467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.633467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a fuzzy controller for DC-DC converters using an inexpensive 8-b microcontroller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","DC-DC power converters","Microcontrollers","Fuzzy logic","Arithmetic","Switching converters","Integrated circuit technology","Analog integrated circuits","Voltage control","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","voltage control","digital control","analogue-digital conversion","fuzzy control","nonlinear control systems","microcontrollers","PWM power convertors","microcomputer applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","fuzzy logic controller","microcontroller technology","analog-to-digital converter","PWM generator","on-chip program memory","unsigned integer arithmetic","computational delay","duty cycle","switching cycle","buck power converter","boost power converter","linguistic rules","nonlinear controller","8 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a fuzzy controller for DC-DC converters using an inexpensive 8-b microcontroller","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5711386","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a fuzzy controller for DC-DC converters using an inexpensive 8-b microcontroller","sourcePdf":"00633467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033982S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"172","articleId":"633467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":633469,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Because a straightforward block-matching algorithm (BMA) demands a very large amount of computing power, many fast algorithms have been developed. However, these fast algorithms are often designed to merely reduce arithmetic operations without considering their overall performance in VLSI implementation. Three criteria are used to compare various block-matching algorithms: (1) silicon area, (2) input/output requirement, and (3) image quality. A basic systolic array architecture is chosen to implement all the selected algorithms. The purpose of this study is to compare these representative BMAs using the aforementioned criteria. The advantages/disadvantages of these algorithms in terms of their hardware tradeoff are discussed. The methodology and results presented provide useful guidelines to system designers in selecting a BMA for VLSI implementation.","doi":"10.1109/76.633491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/13743/00633491.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.633491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of block-matching algorithms mapped to systolic-array implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633491/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of block-matching algorithms mapped to systolic-array implementation","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5721277","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of block-matching algorithms mapped to systolic-array implementation","sourcePdf":"00633491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039452S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"44","articleId":"633491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":633494,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Chang","affiliation":["Cambridge Research Laboratory, Digital Equipment Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA","University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ed Chang","id":"37346588600"},{"name":"A.

For the single-disk case, we extend the principle of constant frame grouping from constant bit rate (CBR) to variable bit rate (VBR) scalable video data. When the number of admitted users exceeds the server capacity, the rate of data sent to each user is reduced to relieve the disk system overload, offering a graceful degradation in comparison with nonscalable data. We examine the qualities of video reconstructions obtained from a real disk video server and find the scalable video more visually appealing. In the VBR case, scalability is also used to improve interactivity by reducing the delay associated with using interactive functions in a predictive admission control environment. Finally, we consider the multiple disk scenario and prove that periodic interleaving results in lower system delay than striping in a video server using round-robin scheduling. We verify the results through detailed simulation of a four-disk array.","doi":"10.1109/76.633494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.633494","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/13743/00633494.pdf","startPage":"758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disk-based storage for scalable video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633494/","displayDocTitle":"Disk-based storage for scalable video","volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5721278","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disk-based storage for scalable video","sourcePdf":"00633494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040536S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","articleId":"633494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":633496,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

To enable new applications and services of digital video, it is not only important to develop tools to analyze and browse video, view query results, and formulate better searches, but also to deliver the essence of the material in compact forms. Video visualization describes the joint process of analyzing video and the subsequent derivation of representative visual presentation of the essence of the content. We propose techniques to analyze video and build a compact pictorial summary for visual presentation. A video sequence is thus condensed into a few images-each summarizing the dramatic incident taking place in a meaningful segment of the video. In particular, we present techniques to differentiate the dominance of the content in subdivisions of the segment based on analysis results, select a graphic layout pattern according to the relative dominances, and create a set of video posters, each of which is a compact, visually pleasant, and intuitive representation of the story content. The collection of video posters arranged in temporal order then forms a pictorial summary of the sequence to tell the underlying story. The techniques and compact presentations proposed offer valuable tools for new applications and services of digital video including video browsing, query, search, and retrieval in the digital libraries and over the Internet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5721279","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Video visualization for compact presentation and fast browsing of pictorial content","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video visualization for compact presentation and fast browsing of pictorial content","sourcePdf":"00633496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044975S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"201","articleId":"633496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":633499,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Facial sequences, in fact, represent an acoustic-visual source characterized by two strongly correlated components: a talking face and the associated speech, whose synchronous presentation must be guaranteed in any multimedia application. Therefore, the exact timing for displaying a video frame or for generating a synthetic facial image has to be supervised by some form of speech analysis performed either as preprocessing before encoding or as postprocessing before presentation. Experimental results are reported on the use of time-delay neural networks (TDNN) for the direct estimation of the visible articulation of the mouth starting from the coherent analysis of acoustic speech. The architectural solution of employing a bank of independent single-output TDNNs has been compared to the alternative solution of using only a single multi-output TDNN. Similarly, two different learning procedures have been applied and compared for training the TDNN, the first based on the classic mean square error (MSE) and the second based on a measure of cross-correlation (CC). The superiority of the system based on multiple single-output TDNNs has been proved as well as the improvements, both in terms of convergence speed and estimation fidelity, achievable through the learning algorithm based on cross-correlation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633499/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5721280","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-delay neural networks for estimating lip movements from speech analysis: a useful tool in audio-video synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-delay neural networks for estimating lip movements from speech analysis: a useful tool in audio-video synchronization","sourcePdf":"00633499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05659S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"22","articleId":"633499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":633507,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongli He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zhongli He","id":"37349625400"},{"name":"M.L.

Our study includes a spectral analysis, a complete system simulation, and an experiment which used up to 70 channels of vector arbitrary waveform synthesizer generated quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) or 16-QAM signals to modulate an isolated/cooled distributed-feedback (DFB) laser and two unisolated/uncooled Fabry-Perot (FP) lasers, respectively. Our analytical results show that for an upstream laser diode, over 1000 QPSK channels or 170 16-QAM channels can be delivered, even in the presence of a high relative intensity noise (RIN) of -115 dB/Hz. However, these high capacities are reduced significantly when we consider the effect of collision-based medium access control (MAC) protocols. We found that, in the worst case condition (collisions occur in all but one channels), the ultimate QPSK channel capacity of an upstream laser diode is dramatically reduced from over 1000 to 125 for eight collisions/channel. These results have important implications to systems transporting frequency-stacked return-path bands with or without collision-based MAC channels.

This scheme uses arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG's) of various sizes and requires no additional equipment. It is well known that a large multi/demultiplexer can be constructed by cascading small multi/demultiplexers. We have studied the impact of the number and size of AWG stages on crosstalk performance. This paper proves that to obtain a multistage multi/demultiplexer with minimum crosstalk, the total channel number of each AWG stage must be minimized. For example, cascading 10-channel AWG's and 11-channel AWG's improves the crosstalk performance of a 110-channel multi/demultiplexer by about 7.5 dB. Furthermore, the crosstalk performance degradation due to fabrication error is theoretically investigated taking channel bandwidth into account. Optimum design parameters of multistage AWG's are introduced: When the AWG suppression ratio is 30 dB and the ratio of channel bandwidth to channel spacing is about 0.24, the degradation in crosstalk performance due to fabrication error is minimized. The tradeoff between the crosstalk performance and the efficiency in terms of hardware and wavelength are also discussed. It is discovered that this simple scheme can yield a crosstalk-free WDM router. Crosstalk reduction obtained by this scheme allows the realization of flexible multiwavelength networks based on wavelength routing.","doi":"10.1109/50.633594","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1929","endPage":"1937","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/50/13744/00633594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.633594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk reduction in N/spl times/N WDM multi/demultiplexers by cascading small arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG's)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Optical waveguides","Degradation","Fabrication","Bandwidth","Optical devices","Optical crosstalk","Channel spacing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","wavelength division multiplexing","multiplexing equipment","demultiplexing equipment","optical crosstalk","telecommunication network routing","optical waveguides","optimisation","optical design techniques","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk reduction","demultiplexers","WDM multiplexers","cascading small arrayed waveguide gratings","crosstalk performance","wavelength division multiplexing","arrayed waveguide gratings","minimum crosstalk","total channel number","fabrication error","channel bandwidth","optimum design parameter","multistage AWG","AWG suppression ratio","crosstalk-free WDM router","flexible multiwavelength networks","wavelength routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk reduction in N/spl times/N WDM multi/demultiplexers by cascading small arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG's)","volume":"15","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5726182","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633594/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk reduction in N/spl times/N WDM multi/demultiplexers by cascading small arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG's)","sourcePdf":"00633594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053191S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","articleId":"633594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":633599,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper is concerned with such an attempt to formulate a novel converter topology for a four-quadrant PM brushless DC (PMBDC) motor drive. The proposed topology has a single switch per phase, limiting the motor drive to half-wave operation. However, it also endows unique features with high reliability, such as shoot-through-free topology by having a switch always in series with a phase winding, operational possibilities, even with one- or two-phase windings failure, reducing the converter losses to half that of the full-wave inverter, reduction of gate drivers and amplifiers, and reduction in the logic power supplies requirement. Many of these features result in low cost and compact packaging of the converter for the PM brushless DC motor drive. The machine design modification requirement due to the half-wave operation of the proposed converter is derived in this paper to help in the realization of the proposed motor drive in industrial applications. The formulation and description of the circuit topology and its operation with the motor, their dynamic modeling, simulation and analysis, and its comparison to the full-wave-inverter-fed PMBDC motor drive are the key contributions of this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712598","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A novel single-switch-per-phase converter topology for four-quadrant PM brushless DC motor drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel single-switch-per-phase converter topology for four-quadrant PM brushless DC motor drive","sourcePdf":"00633791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051368S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"23","articleId":"633791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":633797,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Novel ZCT schemes proposed in this paper enable all main switches and auxiliary switches to be turned on and off under zero-current conditions. The zero-current switching at both turn-on and turn-off not only reduces switching losses significantly, but also eliminates the need for passive snubbers, due to the much reduced switch stress. The cost of the auxiliary switches can he reduced compared to the existing ZCT schemes, due to their zero-current turnoff. The proposed technology is well suited for DC-DC and three-phase converters with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), MOS-controlled thyristors (MCTs), and gate-turnoff switches (GTOs). Theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and experimental results are presented to explain the proposed schemes.","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/13752/00633800.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.633800","doi":"10.1109/28.633800","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Switching converters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Zero current switching","Switching loss","Snubbers","Stress","Costs","DC-DC power converters","Thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","AC-AC power convertors","thyristor convertors","MOS-controlled thyristors","switching circuits","insulated gate bipolar transistors","power semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-current transition converters","high-power applications","switch turn-on problems","auxiliary switches","zero-current conditions","zero-current switching","turn-on","turn-off","switching losses reduction","DC-DC converters","three-phase converters","insulated gate bipolar transistors","IGBT","MOS-controlled thyristors","MCT","gate-turnoff switches","GTO","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Improved zero-current transition converters for high-power applications","accessionNumber":"5712607","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved zero-current transition converters for high-power applications","sourcePdf":"00633800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047822S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"92","articleId":"633800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":633802,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It utilizes an H-bridge configuration composed of eight International Rectifier power MOSFETs (parallel connections of two MOSFETs) and four Motorola diodes to convert the DC input voltage to a high-frequency square wave which can then be stepped up with a transformer. The transformer output voltage is then rectified and filtered to produce the DC output voltage. A phase-shifted pulse-width modulation (PWM) switching scheme is utilized to control the MOSFETs in the H bridge. This scheme allows zero-voltage turn-on of the MOSFETs to improve the efficiency. The efficiency of this converter when operated on the laboratory bench was measured to be 89%. The H bridge and transformer were then placed in an oven and operated over an ambient temperature range of 20/spl deg/C-200/spl deg/C.

The paper is purposefully written without \"state-of-the-art\" terminology for the benefit of practicing engineers in facilities today who may not be familiar with neural networks. This paper is expected to be the first in a series that will provide a similar presentation of expert and fuzzy-logic systems.","doi":"10.1109/28.633817","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/13752/00633817.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.633817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applicability of neural networks to industrial and commercial power systems: a tutorial overview","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tutorial","Neural networks","Industrial power systems","Artificial neural networks","Power engineering and energy","Intelligent systems","Humans","Admittance","Power systems","Terminology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial power systems","power system control","power system analysis computing","neural nets","neurocontrollers","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commercial power systems","neural network applications","tutorial overview","introductory knowledge","intelligent systems","training","power system operation","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Applicability of neural networks to industrial and commercial power systems: a tutorial overview","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712624","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applicability of neural networks to industrial and commercial power systems: a tutorial overview","sourcePdf":"00633817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045324S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"20","articleId":"633817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":633824,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Much of the work on this problem existing in the literature is focused on the so-called single-unit RAS model, which is the simplest model in the considered class of RASs. Furthermore, due to a well-established result stating that, even for single-unit RASs, the computation of the maximally permissive DAP is intractable (NP-hard), many researchers (including our group) have focused on obtaining good suboptimal policies which are computationally tractable (scalable) and provably correct. In the first part of the paper, it is shown, however, that for a large subset (in fact, a majority) of single-unit RASs, the optimal DAP can be obtained in real-time with a computational cost which is a polynomial function of the system size (i.e., the number of resource types and the distinct route stages of the processes running through the system). The implications of this result for the entire class of single-unit RASs are also explored. With a result on the design of optimal DAPs for single-unit RASs, the second part of the paper concentrates on the development of scalable and provably correct DAPs for the more general case of conjunctive RASs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/13757/00633824.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.633824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.633824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policies for sequential resource allocation systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","System recovery","Resource management","Digital audio players","Systems engineering and theory","Industrial engineering","Large-scale systems","Manufacturing systems","Real time systems","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","computational complexity","graph theory","flexible manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policies","sequential resource allocation systems","large-scale flexibly automated manufacturing systems","maximally permissive policy","NP-hard","suboptimal policies","polynomial function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policies for sequential resource allocation systems","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5726767","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policies for sequential resource allocation systems","sourcePdf":"00633824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050941S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"145","articleId":"633824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":633827,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Ren Cao","affiliation":["AT and T Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xi-Ren Cao","id":"37087159715"},{"name":"Han-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Han-Fu Chen","id":"37087190512"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"633827","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":174,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity analysis","Markov processes","Steady-state","Performance analysis","Poisson equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Discrete event systems","Computational modeling","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","sensitivity analysis","Banach spaces","probability","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perturbation realization","potentials","sensitivity analysis","Markov processes","infinitesimal generator","steady-state performance","Poisson equations","infinitesimal perturbation analysis"]}],"abstract":"Two fundamental concepts and quantities, realization factors and performance potentials, are introduced for Markov processes. The relations among these two quantities and the group inverse of the infinitesimal generator are studied. It is shown that the sensitivity of the steady-state performance with respect to the change of the infinitesimal generator can be easily calculated by using either of these three quantities and that these quantities can be estimated by analyzing a single sample path of a Markov process. Based on these results, algorithms for estimating performance sensitivities on a single sample path of a Markov process can be proposed. The potentials in this paper are defined through realization factors and are shown to be the same as those defined by Poisson equations.

In particular, there is a requirement for internal antennas for GSM and DCS1800 systems. This paper describes a novel planar dual-band inverted-F antenna for cellular handsets, which operates at the 0.9-GHz and 1.8-GHz bands. The dual-band antenna has almost the same size as a conventional inverted-F antenna operating at 0.9 GHz and has an isolation between bands of better than 17 dB. The bandwidths of the antenna are close to those required for the above systems. Good dual-band action is also obtained for other frequency ratios in the range of 1.3-2.4. Studies also show that the dual-band antenna can operate with one or two feeds. A finite-difference time-domain analysis has been shown to give calculated results close to those measured.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13742/00633849.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.633849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.633849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-frequency planar inverted-F antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Telephone sets","Telephony","GSM","Bandwidth","Frequency","Antenna feeds","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile antennas","cellular radio","telephone sets","finite difference time-domain analysis","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular telephone handsets","internal antennas","DCS1800 systems","GSM systems","dual frequency planar inverted-F antenna","dual band antenna","band isolation","bandwidth","frequency ratios","antenna feeds","finite difference time domain analysis","calculated results","measured results","antenna radiation patterns","0.9 GHz","1.8 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Dual-frequency planar inverted-F antenna","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719599","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-frequency planar inverted-F antenna","sourcePdf":"00633849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040574S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"285","articleId":"633849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":633850,"authors":[{"name":"U.R.

A two-step design procedure is proposed for the design. First, different unloaded antennas configurations are examined with a view to identifying candidates that exhibit the lowest voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and highest gain characteristics. Multi-armed antennas with straight wire segments that branch off symmetrically from a central stem are found to be excellent potential candidates. Next, the antenna with the best performance is loaded with resonant tank circuits and a matching network is designed. The loads can enhance the antenna characteristics to yield high gain and low VSWR by modifying the current distribution and can force it to radiate nearer to the horizon in the elevation plane with an almost omnidirectional pattern in the azimuth plane. An efficient optimization procedure based on the genetic algorithm is employed to simultaneously determine the load components, their locations, and the parameters of the matching network. Several examples of four- and eight-arm antennas with bandwidth of 7.5:1 and 15:1 illustrate the effectiveness of the design procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5719605","volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New designs of ultra wide-band communication antennas using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New designs of ultra wide-band communication antennas using a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00633856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029501S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"37","articleId":"633856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":633858,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Many projected Ka-band services will use very small terminals and, for some, rain effects may only form a relatively small part of the total propagation link margin. It is therefore necessary to identify and predict the overall impact of every significant attenuating effect along any given path. A procedure for predicting the combined effect of rain attenuation and several other propagation impairments (at frequencies between 4 and 35 GHz) along Earth-satellite paths is presented. Where an accurate model exist for some phenomena, these have been incorporated into the prediction procedure. New models were developed, however, for rain attenuation, cloud attenuation, and low-angle fading to provide more overall accuracy, particularly at very low elevation angles (<10/spl deg/). In the absence of a detailed knowledge of the occurrence probabilities of different impairments, an empirical approach is taken in estimating their combined effects.

Results indicate that the rain attenuation element of the model provides the best average accuracy globally between 10 and 30 GHz and that the combined procedure gives prediction accuracies comparable to uncertainties associated with the year-to-year variability of path attenuation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prediction model that combines rain attenuation and other propagation impairments along Earth-satellite paths","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.633864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13742/00633864.pdf","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.633864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A prediction model that combines rain attenuation and other propagation impairments along Earth-satellite paths","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719611","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prediction model that combines rain attenuation and other propagation impairments along Earth-satellite paths","sourcePdf":"00633864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039417S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"183","articleId":"633864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":633869,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The analog waveform passes through a bandlimited (possibly time-varying) analog channel, where the signal is distorted and noise is added. In a conventional system the analog sample functions sent through the channel are weighted sums of one or more sinusoids; in a chaotic communications system, the sample functions are segments of chaotic waveforms. At the receiver, the symbol may be recovered by means of coherent detection, where all possible sample functions are known, or by noncoherent detection, where one or more characteristics of the sample functions are estimated. In a coherent receiver, synchronization is the most commonly used technique for recovering the sample functions from the received waveform. These sample functions are then used as reference signals for a correlator. Synchronization-based receivers have advantages over noncoherent ones in terms of noise performance and bandwidth efficiency. These advantages are lost if synchronization cannot be maintained, for example, under poor propagation conditions. In these circumstances, communication without synchronization may be preferable. The main aim of this paper is to provide a unified approach for the analysis and comparison of conventional and chaotic communications systems. In Part I, the operation of sinusoidal communications techniques is surveyed in order to clarify the role of synchronization and to classify possible demodulation methods for chaotic communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/13745/00633882.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.633882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.633882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13745","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of synchronization in digital communications using chaos.

Given the parameters of the chaotic system and the impulsive control law, an estimation of the upper bound of the impulse interval is given. We also present a theory of impulsive synchronization of two chaotic systems. A promising application of impulsive synchronization of chaotic systems to a secure communication scheme is presented. In this secure communication scheme, the transmitted signals are divided into small time frames. In each time frame, the synchronization impulses and the scrambled message signal are embedded. Conventional cryptographic methods are used to scramble the message signal.

A CSP is typically defined as the problem of finding any consistent labeling for a fixed set of variables satisfying all given constraints between these variables. However, for many real tasks, the set of constraints to consider may evolve because of the environment or because of user interactions. The problem considered here is the solution maintenance problem in such a dynamic CSP (DCSP).

It offers an interesting compromise, polynomially bounded in space, between an ATMS-like approach and the usual static constraint satisfaction algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1993.633935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13758","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE Conference on Tools with Al (TAI-93)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE Conference on Tools with Al (TAI-93)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5016/13758/00633935.pdf","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nogood Recording for static and dynamic constraint satisfaction problems","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1993.633935","startPage":"48","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=633935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Nogood Recording for static and dynamic constraint satisfaction problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/633935/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4910403","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nogood Recording for static and dynamic constraint satisfaction problems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00633935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033909S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov 1993","isNumber":"13758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5016","citationCount":"18","articleId":"633935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":633963,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The techniques are: (a) measurements of interfacial polarization spectra by a DC method; and (b) measurements of molecular weight and its distribution by gel permeation chromatography. Several other electrical properties of the cellulose polymer were also investigated. Samples were obtained from a retired power transformer and they were analysed by the developed techniques. Six distribution transformers were also tested with the interfacial polarization spectra measurement technique, and the molecular weight of paper/pressboard samples from these transformers were also measured by the gel permeation chromatography. The variation of the results through different locations in a power transformer is discussed in this paper. The possible correlation between different measured properties was investigated and discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/61.634174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13765/00634174.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.634174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13765","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical and chemical diagnostics of transformers insulation.

Short-term accelerated ageing experiments were performed on paper-wrapped insulated conductors and on pressboard samples. The condition of aged insulation samples was investigated by two relatively new diagnostic techniques: (a) measurements of interfacial polarization spectra by a DC method; and (b) measurements of molecular weight and its distribution by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Several other electrical properties of the paper/pressboard samples were also studied. Possible correlations have been investigated among the different measured properties. The GPC results have been used to predict how power transformer insulation molecular weights change with temperature and time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chemicals","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Power transformer insulation","Accelerated aging","Degradation","Power transformers","Conductors","Polarization","Weight measurement","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulation testing","power transformer insulation","power transformer testing","electric breakdown","insulation testing","life testing","ageing","paper","dielectric polarisation","chromatography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformer insulation diagnosis","electrical diagnostics","chemical diagnostics","accelerated aged insulation samples","short-term ageing","paper-wrapped insulated conductors","pressboard samples","interfacial polarization spectra measurements","molecular weight","gel permeation chromatography","paper insulation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.634175","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13765/00634175.pdf","doi":"10.1109/61.634175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical and chemical diagnostics of transformers insulation.

The analysis begins by modeling non-EV load with typical utility load shapes. EV load is modeled using the results from an analytical solution technique that predicts the net power and harmonic currents generated by a group of EV battery chargers. We evaluate the amount of transformer derating by maintaining constant daily transformer loss-of-life, with and without EV charging. This analysis shows that the time of day and the length of time during which the EVs begin charging are critical in determining the amount of transformer derating required. Our results show that with proper control, EV charging may have very little effect on power system components at the substation level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13765/00634176.pdf","startPage":"1562","endPage":"1568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.634176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.634176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A procedure for derating a substation transformer in the presence of widespread electric vehicle battery charging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substations","Batteries","Load modeling","Electric vehicles","Electrical equipment industry","Shape","Predictive models","Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","transformer substations","battery chargers","load (electric)","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substation transformer derating","electric vehicle battery charging","peak summer day","utility load shapes","electric vehicle load modeling","net power prediction","harmonic currents prediction","daily transformer loss-of-life","power system components"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A procedure for derating a substation transformer in the presence of widespread electric vehicle battery charging","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5720471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A procedure for derating a substation transformer in the presence of widespread electric vehicle battery charging","sourcePdf":"00634176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037452S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"41","articleId":"634176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":634183,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This was an historic milestone in the initiative for flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) promoted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The TVA STATCON is the first of its kind, using GTO thyristor valves, to be commissioned in the United States, and is currently the largest installation of this type in the world. Commissioning tests have now been completed and the STATCON is operating continuously online. The demonstrated performance of the equipment has either met or exceeded expectations in all areas and has proven beyond doubt the viability of this type of equipment in high power transmission systems. This paper briefly reviews the STATCON installation and reports on the static and dynamic performance observed during commissioning.","doi":"10.1109/61.634209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13765/00634209.pdf","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.634209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation of /spl plusmn/100 MVAr TVA STATCON","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Operation of /spl plusmn/100 MVAr TVA STATCON","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5727622","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of /spl plusmn/100 MVAr TVA STATCON","sourcePdf":"00634209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035951S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"109","articleId":"634209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":634210,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The model is based on the stochastic nature of the electric arc current-voltage characteristic. The model has been estimated from measurements made in two actual electric plants. Although a single-phase model has been normally proposed, this paper develops a three-phase model in order to fully represent the unbalances that are present in real industrial plants and which play a central role in the behavior of compensation devices such as SVCs. The model has been implemented using the SIMULINK environment in order to facilitate later simulation of advanced disturbance control systems. Finally, the simulation results are compared with actual data in order to validate the accuracy of the model.","doi":"10.1109/61.634210","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13765/00634210.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.634210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and modelling of a three phase arc furnace for voltage disturbance simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Furnaces","Voltage fluctuations","Stochastic processes","System identification","Production","Electrodes","Current-voltage characteristics","Electric variables measurement","Control system synthesis","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial power systems","power system harmonics","arc furnaces","load (electric)","power system analysis computing","harmonic distortion","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase arc furnace","voltage disturbance simulation","voltage fluctuations","voltage harmonics","unbalances","industrial plants","compensation devices","SVCs","SIMULINK environment","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Identification and modelling of a three phase arc furnace for voltage disturbance simulation","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5727623","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and modelling of a three phase arc furnace for voltage disturbance simulation","sourcePdf":"00634210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029861S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"86","articleId":"634210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":634216,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"634216","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3234},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flexible AC transmission systems","Control systems","Voltage control","Power systems","Reactive power","Power generation","Dictionaries","Power & Energy Society","Standards development","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","power transmission","IEEE standards","nomenclature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission system","FACTS","electric utility industry","power delivery","terms","definitions","IEEE Dictionary","terminology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634216","abstract":"FACTS is an acronym for flexible AC transmission system.

Periodic transmission of digital message packets satisfies most telesonar applications, including data reporting from oceanographic sensors, controlling autonomous devices, monitoring offshore-oil equipment, and communicating with undersea vehicles. These applications are well served by robust, low-data-rate, noncoherent, multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) signaling offering greater affordability, networkability, and energy conservation than coherent modems. Well designed MFSK signaling furthermore provides superior reliability in noisy, doubly spread, forward-scattered, horizontal channels such as those found in littoral ocean environments. This paper describes the design of the new telesonar type-A MFSK acoustic modem providing communication rates of 100 to 2400 bit/s. Improved performance in adverse transmission channels is obtained from increased signaling diversity and stronger coding techniques based on symbol sets derived from Hadamard matrices. The new product also preserves the 1-of-4 MFSK modulation mode used in the Datasonics ATM-850 modem. The parallel goal of reduced cost is achieved by the new modem electronics design and packaging.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634370","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

The current generation of underwater telemetry systems tend to use proven, low data rate, 'discrete-component' designs. Although these systems perform well in static environments, their performance rapidly degenerates when the environment becomes more dynamic. The next generation of underwater telemetry systems must be able to adapt automatically to the changing environment and counteract time-varying effects by means of flexible signal processing techniques and detection algorithms. This goal is hard, if not impossible, to realise using conventional 'discrete component' designs. This paper presents a vertical communication system that uses an 'Analogue Devices' digital signal processor (DSP) at its heart. This DSP controls the transmission of data and operative commands to and from a seafloor unit, using multi-phase, 2, 4 or 8, differential phase shift keying (DPSK). This system is considered to be the first step towards a completely autonomous, adaptive communications system.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634372","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

They fight intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation. They have to be used if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is inferior to 0 dB. They are particularly interesting for anti-jamming or discretion purposes. The low SNR technique is also resorted to in case of peak-limited energy (and long range propagation) or energy saving (immersed autonomous transmitter). We present and discuss first the method used which consists in transmitting pseudo-noise codes or 'signatures'. Binary sequences from the Gold and Kasami families were chosen to increase the data rate. In this case, the decision is taken after multi-correlation. New direct sequences of variable lengths and conceived at LETI-CEA (France) are also selected. They are particularly interesting in a multi-user environments (CDMA for example). The results obtained for two Mediterranean communications situations between a boat and the military site of Cap Ferrat (near Nice) are presented. For the last experiment, a 20-km communication was maintained for several minutes, using the new LETI 72-chip sequences, with an error rate inferior to 0.2% and a very low SNR, about -14 dB (7 bits/s). Due to close multipaths, the fading phenomenon is a delicate problem for underwater communications. To combat fading, spatial diversity seems a better solution than time or frequency diversity. Results obtained using seven receivers placed between 100 and 300 m are presented. Different combining methods were tested: selection, maximal ratio combining... . The best results were obtained using a few sensors.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634429","endPage":"579 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

A receiver structure capable of operating over this wide range of characteristics has evolved and consists of a fractionally-spaced multi-channel combiner, a sparse DFE, and an embedded PLL. At the computational heart of this receiver is an adaptation algorithm, used to update the various equalizer parameters, The adaptation algorithm may use one of the standard strategies such as adaptive step-size LMS, RLS, adaptive memory RLS, or a hybrid of these. The choice of algorithm involves trade-offs between training time, tracking-rate, operating SNR, and computational requirements of the receiver. To maximize the receiver throughput, we wish to select the least computational algorithm for which the error-rate is still acceptable and, given the volatility of the underwater channel, this choice should be made for each received packet, In this paper, we compare the performance of several LMS and RLS adaptation algorithms over a range of real acoustic data. We show that the computationally-efficient adaptive step-size LMS performs well for many channel classes, but that the faster tracking of RLS is essential for some complex non-stationary channels. The results provide a first step towards the automatic selection of adaptation algorithm, as would be required in a fully autonomous receiver.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634430","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

Although deployment of video cameras onboard submersibles have become commonplace, computer processing of underwater images for scene reconstruction and interpretation is a technology yet to be developed. This paper describes steps toward the development of an active vision system for intelligent data acquisition and processing. This provides the capability to obtain information about the scene from video images online, and to exploit this knowledge in enhancing the data acquisition process; by achieving optimum parameters and geometry of the imaging system to improve image quality and information content.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634438","publicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

The modems were designed to provide robust underwater acoustic communication at throughput data rates of approximately 900 and 1800 bits per second. Since February 1996 the modems have been used in seven exercises in four diverse deep water and shallow water environment. The results from the tests are very encouraging. Continuous, low error transmission has been achieved over many minutes (/spl sim/20 min.). Detection ranges for the system have exceeded 4 km in shallow water and 8 km in deep water. In January 1997, the acoustic modems were used for continuous, full duplex communications.

We propose a new dynamic non preemptive scheduling algorithm for a relatively new task model called parallelizable task model where real time tasks can be executed concurrently on multiple processors. We use this parallelism in tasks to meet their deadlines and thus obtain better processor utilization compared to nonparallelizable task scheduling algorithms. We assume that tasks are aperiodic. Further, each task is characterized by its deadline, resource requirements, and worst case computation time on p processors, where p is the degree of task parallelization. To study the effectiveness of our algorithm, we have conducted extensive simulation studies and compared its performance with the myopic scheduling algorithm (K. Ramamritham et al., 1990). We found that the success ratio offered by our algorithm is always higher than the myopic algorithm for a wide variety of task parameters. Also, we propose a resource reclaiming algorithm to reclaim resources from parallelizable real time tasks when their actual computation times are less than their worst case computation times. Our parallelizable task scheduling together with its associated reclaiming offers the best guarantee ratio compared to the other algorithmic combinations.","doi":"10.1109/HIPC.1997.634494","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fourth International Conference on High-Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fourth International Conference on High-Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel3/5020/13768/00634494.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIPC.1997.634494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic scheduling of parallelizable tasks and resource reclaiming in real-time multiprocessor systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic scheduling of parallelizable tasks and resource reclaiming in real-time multiprocessor systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5767644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic scheduling of parallelizable tasks and resource reclaiming in real-time multiprocessor systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"00634494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039131S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1997","isNumber":"13768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5020","citationCount":"1","articleId":"634494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":634638,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As is well-known, the tuning of accurate models of real plants (obtained, for instance, by using the physical knowledge of the plants and the technicians' expertise), on the basis of the measures provided by the available sensors, remains a challenge. In this paper, a tuning methodology for complex large-scale models, is presented. The proposed technique is based on the suitable use of neural networks and specific stochastic-approximation algorithms. It is therefore possible to design a simulator that can be connected in parallel with a real plant, thus providing the plant technician with information about inaccessible variables that are useful for supervision purposes. The proposed methodology is applied to a section of a real 320 MW power plant. Simulation results on the tuning algorithm show the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/3468.634638","pdfPath":"/iel3/3468/13776/00634638.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3468.634638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear modeling of complex large-scale plants using neural networks and stochastic approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear modeling of complex large-scale plants using neural networks and stochastic approximation","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5733221","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear modeling of complex large-scale plants using neural networks and stochastic approximation","sourcePdf":"00634638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042417S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"14","articleId":"634638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":634643,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this paper, a BiCMOS high-Q (Q=29) 10.7-MHz switched-capacitor (SC) bandpass filter to be used in the FM receiver channel has been developed. The filter uses low-gain large-bandwidth opamps. The opamp finite gain effects have been compensated using an SC integrator suited for high-Q filters. The particular SC finite-gain compensation scheme allows the implementation of double sampling to relax opamp bandwidth requirements. To reduce total output noise, noisy T-cell networks (often used in other cases) have been avoided. The resulting large capacitors (the largest capacitor is 8.5 pF) are driven by a Class AB output buffer. In a 1.2-/spl mu/m BiCMOS technology, the filter prototype has an area of about 1.6 mm/sup 2/ and a power consumption of 17 mW.

Test mode flexibility is achieved by breaking down complicated test mode control into more than one primitive test mode. The primitive test modes can be selected together through a WE CAS Before RAS (WCBR) cycle with a series of addresses for mode select. Although each primitive test mode may not complete a meaningful task alone, their combination performs many complex and powerful test modes. In this design, 64 primitive test modes are available. These can be combined to realize more than 19000 useful test modes. A new signal margin test mode is introduced which allows an accurate signal margin test even for small capacitance cells, which are difficult to identify in existing plate-bump method. A flexible multiwordline select test mode effectively performs a toggled wordline disturb test, a long t/sub RAS/ wordline disturb test, and a transfer gate stress voltage test, without causing any unnatural array disturbance. Finally, test modes, which can directly control the timing of sense amplifiers and column select lines, are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/4.634660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.634660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/13773/00634660.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible test mode approach for 256-Mb DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Flexible test mode approach for 256-Mb DRAM","volume":"32","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719584","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634660/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible test mode approach for 256-Mb DRAM","sourcePdf":"00634660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056818S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","articleId":"634660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":634661,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Jun Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Jun Song","id":"37343948500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"634661","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Random access memory","Voltage","Standby generators","Leakage current","Optimal control","Automatic control","Switching circuits","CMOS process","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","pulse generators","CMOS memory circuits","leakage currents","integrated circuit measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-off-time detector","standby current","DRAM","voltage generators","optimal off-time interval","dynamic ON/OFF switching ratio","power-dissipation circuits","level detectors","substrate back-bias voltage generator","double-poly double-metal CMOS process","total average standby current","leakage current","self-refresh circuit","0.35 micron","0.1 to 1 muA"]}],"abstract":"A self-off-time detector is proposed for reducing the standby current due to various voltage generators in DRAM's.

By simultaneously propagating data and clock signals through two different delay taps, the sampler achieves a very fine sampling resolution which is determined by the difference between the data and clock delays. This high resolution sampling capability of the matched delay sampler can be used in the oversampling data recovery circuit. A data recovery circuit using the matched delay sampling technique has been designed and fabricated in 1.2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. The chip has been tested at 417 Mb/s [2.4 ns nonreturn to zero (NRZ)] input data and demultiplexes serial input data into four 104 Mb/s (9.6 ns NRZ) output streams with 800 mW power consumption at 4 V power supply.

The analysis shows that the cycle time of the conventional pipeline structures cannot be reduced because of its difficulty in distributing the access time evenly to each pipeline stage of the column address access path. On the contrary, the wave pipeline architecture can make the access path evenly divided and can increase the number of pipeline stages to achieve the shortest cache refill time. But the wave congestion at the output terminal of the wave pipeline path caused by access time fluctuation narrows the valid time window. The parallel registered wave pipeline architecture can remove the effect of access time fluctuation so that the cycle time is defined only by the data pulse width. If the data pulse width t/sub w/<2 ns, even 500-MHz clock frequency can be obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Random access memory","SDRAM","Clocks","Central Processing Unit","Fluctuations","Frequency synchronization","Delay","Space vector pulse width modulation","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","cache storage","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed synchronous DRAM","Pentium CPU","on-chip cache","parallel registered wave pipeline architecture","access time fluctuation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634671","doi":"10.1109/4.634671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/13773/00634671.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.634671","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of pipeline architectures for high-speed synchronous DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study of pipeline architectures for high-speed synchronous DRAMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","volume":"32","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719595","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of pipeline architectures for high-speed synchronous DRAMs","sourcePdf":"00634671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041462S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"634671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":634673,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

We first review results for the Shannon capacity of fading channels with channel side information, where capacity is achieved using adaptive transmission techniques. We then derive the spectral efficiency of our proposed modulation. We show that there is a constant power gap between the spectral efficiency of our proposed technique and the channel capacity, and this gap is a simple function of the required bit-error rate (BER). In addition, using just five or six different signal constellations, we achieve within 1-2 dB of the maximum efficiency using unrestricted constellation sets. We compute the rate at which the transmitter needs to update its power and rate as a function of the channel Doppler frequency for these constellation sets. We also obtain the exact efficiency loss for smaller constellation sets, which may be required if the transmitter adaptation rate is constrained by hardware limitations. Our modulation scheme exhibits a 5-10-dB power gain relative to variable-power fixed-rate transmission, and up to 20 dB of gain relative to nonadaptive transmission. We also determine the effect of channel estimation error and delay on the BER performance of our adaptive scheme. We conclude with a discussion of coding techniques and the relationship between our proposed modulation and Shannon capacity.","doi":"10.1109/26.634685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.634685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13775/00634685.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for fading channels","volume":"45","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5727027","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634685/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for fading channels","sourcePdf":"00634685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03093S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1411","articleId":"634685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":634687,"authors":[{"name":"V.M.

These transmissions are coordinated to mitigate the effects of Rayleigh fading, and the mobile receiver can recover the entire L-dimensional transmitted vector signal as long as the signal energy of at least one coordinate is large enough. L-dimensional fading-resistant signal constellations are generated by maximizing a figure of merit for the Rayleigh fading channel. This scheme offers a significant performance improvement over a conventional single-antenna binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) scheme when coding is ineffective due to slow fading.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13775/00634687.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.634687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.634687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fading-resistant modulation using several transmitter antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Diversity methods","Diversity reception","Fading","Modulation coding","Receiving antennas","Base stations","Rayleigh channels","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","fading","modulation coding","diversity reception","land mobile radio","radio transmitters","phase shift keying","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading-resistant modulation","transmitter antennas","bandwidth-efficient fading-resistant transmission scheme","transmitter diversity","base station","Rayleigh fading","mobile receiver","L-dimensional transmitted vector signal","signal constellations","figure of merit","performance","coding","coded modulation","antenna diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fading-resistant modulation using several transmitter antennas","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5727029","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fading-resistant modulation using several transmitter antennas","sourcePdf":"00634687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026709S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"76","articleId":"634687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":634688,"authors":[{"name":"Seok Chang Kim","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Middletown, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Seok Chang Kim","id":"37087217918"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Gi Lee","id":"37086999429"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"634688","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":71},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Asynchronous transfer mode","Frequency selective surfaces","Sampling methods","Shift registers","Synchronous digital hierarchy","Bit rate","Optical signal processing","Synchronous generators","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","shift registers","synchronisation","signal sampling","binary sequences","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel realizations","distributed sample scramblers","cell-based ATM transmission","shift register generator engines","SRG sequence-generating circuits","PSRG theory","parallel FSS","frame synchronous scrambler","synchronization","parallel DSS","double-sampling","double-correction schemes","sample conveyance channels","sampling time","vector's condition","correction time","descrambling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634688","doi":"10.1109/26.634688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.634688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13775/00634688.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel realizations of distributed sample scramblers for applications to cell-based ATM transmission","abstract":"In this paper, a theory is developed in support of parallel realizations of the distributed sample scramblers (DSS) in the cell-based ATM transmission environment.

In the general DSS, the samples transmitted to the descrambler for its synchronization are freely generated out of the scrambler SRG, a special case of which is to take samples directly from the SRG sequence. To describe this general sampling method, the concept of sampling vectors is introduced. The delayed sample-transmission problem, which is a real problem in practical transmission systems, can be resolved by adopting the sampling vectors. This paper provides a systematic solution to the synchronization problem of the general DSS based on mathematical modeling. It first considers the sampling problem of the SRG state information, and then discusses the correction problem of the descrambler SRG state using the transmitted samples. Applications are attached at the end to demonstrate the developed theory for simple realizations of the DSS for use in the cell-based ATM transmission environment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shift registers","Decision support systems","Sampling methods","Mathematical model","Asynchronous transfer mode","Circuits","Delay effects","Frequency selective surfaces","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","signal sampling","asynchronous transfer mode","binary sequences","shift registers","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shift register generators","general distributed sample scramblers","synchronization","SRG","DSS","sequence","sampling method","sampling vectors","delayed sample-transmission problem","state information","correction problem","cell-based ATM transmission environment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.634689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13775/00634689.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.634689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of shift register generators in general distributed sample scramblers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of shift register generators in general distributed sample scramblers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634689/","volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5727030","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of shift register generators in general distributed sample scramblers","sourcePdf":"00634689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033587S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","articleId":"634689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":634690,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The following techniques are compared: time-division multiple access (TDMA) using on-off keying (OOK) or pulse-position modulation (PPM); frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK); code-division multiple access (CDMA) using OOK with direct-sequence spreading by m-sequences or optical orthogonal codes (OOCs). We define a parameter /spl gamma/, which equals the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for unit optical path gain and is proportional to the square of the transmitted average optical power. Using measured pathloss data, it is found that in a system using hexagonal cells and a reuse factor of three, for cell radii above 3 m, TDMA with OOK or 2-PPM, and CDMA using OOCs all require approximately the same /spl gamma/ to achieve a worst-case bit-error rate (BER) of 10/sup -9/ within a cell. Using TDMA with 4-PPM results in a 6-dB decrease in the required value of /spl gamma/. CDMA using m-sequences requires an increase in /spl gamma/ of 5 dB over TDMA using OOK, and FDMA with BPSK requires an increase of 12 dB. For a given reuse factor N in the noise-limited regime, the required value of /spl gamma/ decreases in inverse proportion to N/sup 2/ for TDMA schemes and inversely with N for FDMA and CDMA schemes. For cell radii below 3 m, cochannel interference dominates the systems using TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA with an OOC, resulting in an irreducible BER above 10/sup -9/ at cell radii below 1.5 m. Only CDMA with m-sequences does not develop an irreducible BER, making it the only choice for cell radii below 1.5 m.","doi":"10.1109/26.634692","startPage":"1280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13775/00634692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.634692","endPage":"1290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel reuse strategies for indoor infrared wireless communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634692/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Channel reuse strategies for indoor infrared wireless communications","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5727033","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel reuse strategies for indoor infrared wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00634692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040781S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","articleId":"634692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":634693,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Our algorithm performs nondata-aided feedforward processing of finite-length observations, and it is suited for an all-digital modem implementation based on a DSP or an ASIC processor. The algorithm exploits phase continuity of M-CPFSK in order to generate both a spectral component at the carrier frequency offset and a timing error signal. This is obtained without nonlinear transformations of the received signal involving noise/spl times/noise products. Thus, our algorithm can operate at a very low input signal-to-noise ratio. We discuss the operating range of our algorithm, and we show that no additional overhead (training sequence) in excess of the standard overhead of FDMA/TDMA packet transmission is required to resolve timing and frequency ambiguities. Moreover, we show that by differentially preceding the transmitted symbols, it is possible to eliminate automatically frequency ambiguities, at the price of a slight increase in the bit-error rate. An approximate mean-square error analysis of the estimators and simulation results prove that our algorithm provides good performance, even with a relatively short observation block length and large carrier frequency offset. Computer simulations show also that our algorithm is extremely robust to phase noise. These features make our algorithm a good candidate for satellite FDMA/TDMA applications in the 20-30 GHz band, with a large number of users and bursty transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5734376","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new symbol timing and carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm for noncoherent orthogonal M-CPFSK","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new symbol timing and carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm for noncoherent orthogonal M-CPFSK","sourcePdf":"00634695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035587S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"634695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":634696,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Many expert systems in business, engineering, and medicine have benefited from sequential decision technology. In this survey, we unify the disparate literature on sequential decision models to improve comprehensibility and accessibility. We separate formulation of sequential decision models from solution techniques. For model formulation, we classify sequential decision models by objective (cost minimization versus value maximization) knowledge source (rules, data, belief network, etc.), and optimized form (decision tree, path, input order).

Mining association rules means that, given a database of sales transactions, to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items that appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first, and then, identifying, within this candidate set, these itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally, this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k, where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate sets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation. It is a hash-based algorithm and is especially effective for the generation of a candidate set for large 2-itemsets. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. The advantage of the proposed algorithm also provides us the opportunity of reducing the amount of disk I/O required. An extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634757/","volume":"9","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5771691","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using a hash-based method with transaction trimming for mining association rules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a hash-based method with transaction trimming for mining association rules","sourcePdf":"00634757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030799S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"182","articleId":"634757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":634760,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is expected that registrations will incur a large amount of the radio link signaling traffic. A profile-based strategy (PBS) is proposed to reduce the signaling traffic on the radio link by increasing the intelligence within the fixed network. The system maintains a sequential list of the most likely places where each user is located. The list is ranked from the most to the least likely place where a user is found. When a call arrives for a mobile, it is paged sequentially in each location within the list. When a user moves between location areas in this list, no location update is required. The list may be provided by the user or may be based on each user's past calling history. The method for doing this is outside the scope of this work. This work focuses on the potential performance improvements that can result from maintaining such a list. This paper compares the performance of the proposed strategy to the typical geographic-based location-tracking schemes being implemented in evolving digital cellular and cordless standards. Key performance measures for the comparison are radio bandwidth, fixed network SS7 traffic, and call setup delay. We investigate the conditions under which the PBS performs better than the traditional scheme. Results indicate that over a wide range of parameters, it may be possible to reduce both the radio bandwidth and fixed network signaling load for a modest increase in call setup delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A profile-based location strategy and its performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.634782","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13785/00634782.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.634782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A profile-based location strategy and its performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5733279","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A profile-based location strategy and its performance","sourcePdf":"00634782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026837S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"70","articleId":"634782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":634787,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The system model is designed to accommodate bursty packet-based data services in addition to stream-based services on a shared spectrum basis. A common packet data channel (CPDC) is employed to transport bursty data services, Consequently, this study incorporates features associated with packet-based services, such as higher transmitter power, short inter-arrival times, and short service time durations, as well as features associated with stream-based services, in order to provide a complete interference characterization. The results of a detailed and precise simulation study are presented in which the influence of traffic burstiness, voice activity, spatial distribution of mobiles, and transmitter powers on the fluctuation of the interference and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is assessed. The results obtained also quantify the impact of interference caused by CPDC services on stream-based services. The interference and SIR statistics are evaluated in terms of cumulative distribution functions. Since a DS-CDMA network is interference limited, studies of this type are essential for system design, capacity evaluation, and bandwidth management.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference and SIR in integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks-a simulation study","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.634791","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13785/00634791.pdf","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.634791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Interference and SIR in integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks-a simulation study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5733288","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference and SIR in integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks-a simulation study","sourcePdf":"00634791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0642S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","articleId":"634791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":634792,"authors":[{"name":"B.

One of the main concerns of this work is to verify if and to what extent strategies belonging to this class can offer better performance than fixed channel allocation (FCA) in realistic traffic and propagation conditions. The impact of the introduction in a real network of two of the more promising DCA strategies in the considered class is assessed. In particular, solutions are presented concerning the signaling exchanges entailed by the implementation of each of the considered DCA strategies. A performance evaluation of a realistic cellular network exploiting the above-mentioned DCA strategies is carried out, taking into account all of the main GSM transmission and network aspects. The simulations have been performed by considering a realistic cell layout corresponding to the urban area of Rome, its realistic propagation environment, and a user mobility model based on the building percentages in such an area. The results of the performance evaluation show that, by carefully choosing the values of the parameters characterizing each of the considered DCA strategies, a conspicuous increase in the number of users supported by the cellular network can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5733291","displayDocTitle":"Application of dynamic channel allocation strategies to the GSM cellular network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of dynamic channel allocation strategies to the GSM cellular network","sourcePdf":"00634794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0346S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","articleId":"634794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":634795,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper describes the development of a new capacity design method based on these two concepts. Theoretical expressions for GoS and QoS as functions of traffic intensity and CAC thresholds are first derived from the traffic theory viewpoint, and then a design method using these expressions is presented. At that time, two strategies for CAC are assumed. One is based on the number of users, and the other is based on the interference level. Computer simulation results are presented that strongly support the proposed design method. Furthermore, numerical examples and a performance comparison of the two strategies considering various propagation parameters, nonuniform traffic distributions, and various transmission rates are shown.","doi":"10.1109/49.634800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13785/00634800.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.634800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13785","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity design and performance of call admission control in cellular CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity design and performance of call admission control in cellular CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5733297","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity design and performance of call admission control in cellular CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00634800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059471S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"106","articleId":"634800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":634801,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first-generation candidates for satellite personal communication networks (S-PCN) will rely on low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) constellations. A noticeable trend in this field is toward broadband services and the use of ATM. For LEO satellite systems employing intersatellite links (ISLs), this paper proposes an overall networking concept that introduces the strengths of ATM to their operation. The core of the paper is the design of a new routing scheme for the periodically time-variant ISL subnetwork, discrete-time dynamic virtual topology routing (DT-DVTR), and its ATM implementation. DT-DVTR works completely off line, i.e., prior to the operational phase of the system. In a first step, a virtual topology is set up for all successive time intervals of the system period, providing instantaneous sets of alternative paths between all source-destination node pairs. In the second step, path sequences over a series of time interval are chosen from that according to certain optimization procedures. An ATM-based implementation of DT-DVTR in LEO satellite ISL networks is presented with some emphasis on the optimization alternatives, and the performance in terms of delay jitter is evaluated for an example ISL topology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13785/00634801.pdf","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.634801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.634801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic routing concept for ATM-based satellite personal communication networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Artificial satellites","Personal communication networks","Asynchronous transfer mode","Low earth orbit satellites","Telecommunication network topology","Aerodynamics","Telecommunication traffic","Quality of service","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","satellite links","personal communication networks","telecommunication network routing","optimisation","network topology","mobile satellite communication","jitter","internetworking","B-ISDN","discrete time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic routing","ATM","satellite personal communication networks","satellite systems","low Earth orbit","medium Earth orbit","broadband services","LEO satellite systems","intersatellite links","networking concept","routing scheme design","periodically time-variant ISL subnetwork","discrete-time dynamic virtual topology routing","DT-DVTR","virtual topology","source-destination node pairs","path sequences","optimization procedures","LEO satellite ISL networks","performance","delay jitter","ISL topology","B-ISDN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic routing concept for ATM-based satellite personal communication networks","volume":"15","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5733298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic routing concept for ATM-based satellite personal communication networks","sourcePdf":"00634801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041829S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"135","articleId":"634801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":634802,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Specifically, each stage of the CRO consists of many electrically parallel delay elements that are spatially distributed. The high degree of parallelism in the CRO provides strong signal aggregation that significantly reduces the skew within each clock phase. The CRO performs both clock generation and clock delivery, thus unifying the tasks of the oscillator, clock buffers, and distribution network into a single circuit. The strength of the CRO technique is that it can deliver multiple, low-skew clock phases to all areas of a large VLSI device at a cost in chip resources comparable to that of current single-phase clock distribution techniques. This strength creates the opportunity for system designers to make extensive use of multi-phase logic techniques to improve system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ARVLSI.1997.634846","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel3/5027/13786/00634846.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARVLSI.1997.634846","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","startPage":"62","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock distribution using cooperative ring oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Clock distribution using cooperative ring oscillators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634846/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5786740","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock distribution using cooperative ring oscillators","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00634846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050862S","chronDate":"15-16 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5027","citationCount":"16","articleId":"634846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":634853,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Emerging portable consumer technology, such as digital cameras, will also require more memory than can be supported easily on logic-oriented ASIC processes. Most ASIC memory systems are P-load SRAM, but this circuit technology is neither dense nor power efficient. This paper describes development of a DRAM, compatible with a standard CMOS ASIC process, that provides a memory density at least 4/spl times/ improved over P-load SRAM in the same layout roles. It runs at speeds comparable to logic in the same process and uses circuitry that is reasonably simple and portable. The design employs Vdd-precharge bit lines, half-capacitance full-voltage dummy cells, and a simple complementary sense amplifier. DRAM is organized as a number of small pages, allowing simple circuit design and low-power operation at modest expense in area overhead. The paper also described a power-conserving low-voltage-swing bus design that interfaces multiple pages to full-voltage-swing circuitry.

However a high performance microprocessor will typically send more accesses than the DRAM can handle due to the long cycle time of the embedded DRAM, especially in applications with significant memory requirements. A multi-bank DRAM can hide the long cycle time by allowing the DRAM to process multiple accesses in parallel, but it will incur a significant area penalty and will therefore restrict the density of the embedded DRAM main memory. In this paper we propose a hierarchical multi-bank DRAM architecture to achieve high system performance with a minimal area penalty. In this architecture, the independent memory banks are each divided into many semi-independent subbanks that share I/O and decoder resources. A hierarchical multi-bank DRAM with 4 main banks each composed of 32 subbanks occupies approximately the same area as a conventional 4 bank DRAM while performing like a 32 bank one-up to 65% better than a conventional 4 bank DRAM when integrated with a single-chip multiprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/ARVLSI.1997.634862","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel3/5027/13786/00634862.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARVLSI.1997.634862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hierarchical multi-bank DRAM: a high-performance architecture for memory integrated with processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"The hierarchical multi-bank DRAM: a high-performance architecture for memory integrated with processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634862/","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5786756","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The hierarchical multi-bank DRAM: a high-performance architecture for memory integrated with processors","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00634862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078378S","chronDate":"15-16 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5027","citationCount":"14","articleId":"634862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":634881,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The paper describes the hardware architecture and its implementation technologies of the Phong and bump mapped shading in an ASIC.","doi":"10.1109/SMA.1997.634892","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/5024/13780/00634892.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMA.1997.634892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13780","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of shading models in an application specific integrated circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=634892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of shading models in an application specific integrated circuit","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/634892/","conferenceDate":"6-6 March 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5559136","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of shading models in an application specific integrated circuit","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"00634892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027002S","chronDate":"3-6 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5024","citationCount":"1","articleId":"634892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":634943,"authors":[{"name":"Liqiong Wei","affiliation":["ECE department, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"lastName":"Liqiong Wei","id":"37331878300"},{"name":"Zhanping Chen","affiliation":["ECE department, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"lastName":"Zhanping Chen","id":"37278565500"},{"name":"K.

The threshold voltages, leakage currents and drive currents for FD SOI MOSFETs and DGDT SOI MOSFETs are compared. DGDT SOI MOSFETs show symmetric characteristics and the best I/sub on/I(off)/. Excellent DC inverter characteristics down to 0.15 V and good full adder performance at 1V are shown. The propagation delay and the average power consumption of the full adder are 0.625 ns and 11.5 /spl mu/W, respectively.

Made possible by recent technological breakthroughs, Passive Millimeter Wave (PMMW) imaging sensors provide visual-like images of objects within their fields of view even under low visibility conditions (e.g., fog, clouds, snow, sandstorms, and smoke) that would blind visual and infrared (IR) sensors. Unlike synthetic images (computer generated), the PMMW image is real and completely passive thus providing numerous advantages over competing technologies. The Boeing Company is member of a consortium developing an advanced, demonstrator version of a PMMW imaging sensor-identified as a 'camera' that, when front-mounted on an aircraft, will give images of the forward scene at a rare and quality sufficient to enhance aircrew vision and situational awareness under low visibility conditions. The characteristics of a PMMW image in a system baseline integrated with other flight avionics to form an Enhanced or Synthetic Vision System, is described. The results of a real-time simulator developed to perform pilot evaluations of the PWMM image are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive millimeter wave imaging sensor enhanced vision system","publicationTitle":"16th DASC.

Bandwidth smoothing techniques can reduce the burstiness of a variable-bit-rate stream by prefetching data at a series of fixed rates, simplifying the allocation of resources in video servers and the communication network. Given a fixed client-side prefetch buffer several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced that are provably optimal under certain constraints. This paper presents a collection of metrics for comparing these smoothing algorithms and evaluating their cost-performance trade-offs. Due to the scarcity of available trace data, we have constructed a video capture testbed and generated a collection of twenty full-length, motion-JPEG encoded video clips. Using these video traces and a range of client buffer sizes, we investigate the interplay between the performance metrics through simulation experiments. The results highlight the unique strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13791","startPage":"58","endPage":"66 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13791/00635114.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of bandwidth smoothing techniques for the transmission of prerecorded compressed video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of bandwidth smoothing techniques for the transmission of prerecorded compressed video","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5906254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of bandwidth smoothing techniques for the transmission of prerecorded compressed video","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038815S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"59","articleId":"635114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":635116,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The DCUR requires limited network state information to be kept at each node: a cost vector and a delay vector. We prove the DCUR's correctness by showing that it is always capable of constructing a loop-free delay-constrained path within finite time, if such a path exists. The worst case message complexity of the DCUR is O(|V|/sup 3/) messages, where |V| is the number of nodes. However simulation results show that, on average, the DCUR requires much fewer messages. Therefore, the DCUR scales well to large networks. We also use simulation to compare the DCUR to the optimal algorithm, and to the least-delay path algorithm. Our results show that the DCUR's path costs are within 10% from those of the optimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635117/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5906258","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A distributed algorithm for delay-constrained unicast routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed algorithm for delay-constrained unicast routing","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033254S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"78","articleId":"635117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":635121,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

The first infracture of this type was the packet radio network (PRNET), developed in the 70's to address the battlefield and disaster recovery communication requirements. PRNET was totally asynchronous and was based on a completely distributed architecture. It handled datagram traffic reasonably well, but did not offer efficient multimedia support. Recently, under the WAMIS and Glomo ARPA programs several mobile, multimedia, multihop (M/sup 3/) wireless network architectures have been developed, which assume some form of synchronous, time division infrastructure. The synchronous time frame leads to efficient multimedia support implementations. However, it introduces more complexity and is less robust in the face of mobility and channel fading. In this paper; we examine the impact of synchronization on wireless M/sup 3/ network performance. First, we introduce MACA/PR, an asynchronous network based on the collision avoidance MAC scheme employed in the IEEE 802.11 standard. There, we evaluate and compare several wireless packet networks ranging from the total asynchronous PRNET to the synchronized cluster TDMA network. We examine the tradeoffs between time synchronization and performance in various traffic and mobility environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13791/00635121.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"125 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=635121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous multimedia multihop wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Telecommunication traffic","Mobile computing","Computer networks","Military computing","Multimedia computing","Packet radio networks","Mobile communication","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiple access","multimedia communication","packet radio networks","synchronisation","telecommunication congestion control","IEEE standards","telecommunication standards","land mobile radio","telecommunication network routing","personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous multimedia multihop wireless networks","personal communications","mobile computing","multimedia service support","packet radio network","WAMIS program","Glomo ARPA program","network architectures","synchronous time division infrastructure","synchronous time frame","channel fading","synchronization","wireless M/sup 3/ network performance","MACA/PR","asynchronous network","collision avoidance MAC scheme","IEEE 802.11 standard","wireless packet networks","PRNET","synchronized cluster TDMA network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous multimedia multihop wireless networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5906262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous multimedia multihop wireless networks","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035744S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"95","articleId":"635121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":635122,"authors":[{"name":"B.P.

The performance of the medium access control (MAC) sublayer, which consists of distributed coordination function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF), is determined by simulating asynchronous data traffic in a 1 Mbps ad hoc network, and asynchronous data and packetized voice traffic in a 1 Mbps infrastructure network. The simulation models incorporate the effect of burst errors, packet size, RTS threshold and fragmentation threshold on network throughput and delay. The results show that the IEEE 802.11 WLAN can achieve a reasonably high efficiency when the medium is almost error-free, but may degrade appreciably under harsh fading. The results also show that time-sensitive traffic such as packet voice can be supported together with other intensive traffic such as packet data. However, an echo canceller is required for packet voice systems.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635122","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13791/00635122.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"133 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) sublayer functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=635122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635122/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) sublayer functions","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5911736","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) sublayer functions","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108378S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"55","articleId":"635122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":635130,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

Amplifiers are required in such networks to compensate for the power losses due to splitting and attenuation. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. The general problem of minimizing the total amplifier count, subject to the device constraints, is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem. Previous studies have attacked the amplifier-placement problem by adding the \"artificial\" constraint that all wavelengths, which are present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level. In this paper, we present a method to solve the minimum-amplifier-placement problem while avoiding the equally-powered-wavelength constraint. We demonstrate-that, by allowing signals to operate at different power levels, our method can reduce the number of amplifiers required in several small to medium-sized networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5911744","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the number of optical amplifiers needed to support a multi-wavelength optical LAN/MAN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the number of optical amplifiers needed to support a multi-wavelength optical LAN/MAN","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038529S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"11","articleId":"635138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":635142,"authors":[{"name":"T.

EKF training procedures are generally considered to be recursive or sequential in nature, where weight updates are performed on an instance-by-instance basis. On the other hand, other second order weight update procedures, such as conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods, are typically based on batch processing of training patterns. The multi-stream EKF weight update procedure combines the useful stochastic and sequential characteristics of the base EKF method with a mechanism that allows for multiple instances to be processed simultaneously in a manner that is consistent with the EKF framework, thereby resulting in an effective semi-batch, second order training method. We motivate the use of multi-stream EKF training by relating Kalman training of a single linear node to a batch least squares solution. The paper concludes with a simulation example of the application of multi-stream EKF training.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.635150","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2011 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The methodology is based on integrating a shaping mechanism with a scheduler from the class of rate-proportional servers (RPS) defined by Stiliadis and Varma (see Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS '96, p.104-15, 1996). The resulting algorithms provide an end-to-end delay bound identical to that of weighted fair queueing. Their worst-case fairness, in terms of minimizing the worst-case delay to empty the session backlog, is much superior to that of weighted fair queueing, and equal to the best known for any scheduling algorithm. In addition, the algorithms achieve a level of fairness in the distribution of free bandwidth among competing sessions better than that of weighted fair queueing. We show that, under this framework, even an unfair scheduling algorithm belonging to the RPS class, such as VirtualClock, can yield worst-case fairness identical to that obtained with weighted fair queueing. We also develop an integrated shaper-scheduler that provides optimal output burstiness and is attractive for use in both network adapters and in switches that support traffic re-shaping. We describe an efficient implementation of this integrated shaping and scheduling algorithm with log/sub 2/(V) complexity, where V is the number of sessions sharing the outgoing link.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13791/00635151.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"335 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=635151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general methodology for designing efficient traffic scheduling and shaping algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Traffic control","Delay","Switches","Bandwidth","Telecommunication traffic","Communication system traffic control","Packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication networks","telecommunication traffic","scheduling","queueing theory","packet switching","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient traffic scheduling","efficient traffic shaping algorithms","algorithm design","integrated shaping-scheduling algorithms","packet networks","weighted fair queueing","low burstiness","rate-proportional servers","end-to-end delay bound","worst-case fairness","worst-case delay","bandwidth distribution","unfair scheduling algorithm","VirtualClock","optimal output burstiness","network adapters","switches","traffic re-shaping","outgoing link sharing","ATM networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A general methodology for designing efficient traffic scheduling and shaping algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5911752","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general methodology for designing efficient traffic scheduling and shaping algorithms","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076077S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"63","articleId":"635151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":635157,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The problem is formulated as a linear programming problem which is solved using standard methods. The objective is to minimize the spare capacity cost for the given restoration requirement. The spare cost depends on the restoration strategies used in the network. We compare several restoration strategies, notably, global versus failure-oriented reconfiguration, path versus link based restoration and state-dependent versus state-independent restoration, quantitatively in terms of spare cost. The advantages and disadvanages of various restoration strategies are also highlighted. Such comparisons provide useful guidance for real network design. Further, a new heuristic algorithm is developed for the design of large self-healing ATM networks using path based restoration. Numerical results illustrate that the heuristic algorithm is efficient and can give near-optimal solutions for spare capacity allocation and flow assignment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.635157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13791","startPage":"353","endPage":"360 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/13791/00635157.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration strategies and spare capacity requirements in self-healing ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/635157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Restoration strategies and spare capacity requirements in self-healing ATM networks","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5911755","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoration strategies and spare capacity requirements in self-healing ATM networks","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00635157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052279S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"26","articleId":"635157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":635189,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Many object recognition methods have been studied. Most of them required one precise object model for recognizing only one object. Accordingly, it is necessary to prepare a model for only one object in advance. Moreover, it is difficult to make the precise model, and a long computational time is necessary to match it with the input image. In this paper, a hierarchical object recognition method using a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. GAs can provide robust search in complex spaces. Therefore GAs are suitable for object recognition problems which have many parameters. In the proposed method, the input image is first simplified, and then the simplified image is matched with a fundamental model. By means of the hierarchical method, a precise object model is not necessary, and only one fundamental model represents the objects which belong to the same category.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.635318","pdfPath":"/iel3/4942/13760/00635318.pdf","startPage":"2549","endPage":"2554 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The errors are serious when the size of the pixel is significant compared to the allowable tolerance in the object dimension on the image. In placing the active sensor to perform inspection, displacement of the sensors in orientation and location is common. The difference between observed dimensions obtained by the displaced sensor and the actual dimensions is defined as displacement errors. The density functions of quantization errors and displacement errors depend on the camera resolution and camera locations and orientations. We use genetic algorithm to minimize the probabilistic magnitude of the errors subject to the sensor constraints, such as the resolution, field-of-view, focus, and visibility constraints. Since the objective functions and the constraint functions are both complicated and nonlinear, traditional nonlinear programming may not be efficient and trapping at a local minimum may occur. Using crossover operations, mutation operations, and the stochastic selection in genetic algorithm, trapping can be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.635348","startPage":"2713","endPage":"2718 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Short pulses are applied differentially to a sense capacitor and reference capacitor.

The pulses impart kinetic energy to the supported plate, and after the pulses are removed, the mechanical system undergoes oscillatory motion.

In our previous papers (1995, 1996), we proposed the self-tuning methods all based on GA. However, when the size of the population grows up and the encoding of the chromosome is very large, the expense of the evolutionary computation would be out of our expectation. In this paper, we combine the ring GA and cache GA to derive a ring-cache GA for improving the efficiency of GA. Another important problem exists in the fuzzy logic controller: when we use GA to tune the controller, the system does not promise to hit the target or goal every time. So we need to define a reliable region or fitness bound to make sure the controller is reliable. In this paper, we enhance the reliability analysis with the original fuzzy logic controller to form a reliable genetic fuzzy logic controller. We use our approach to solve the robot path planning problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ring-cache genetic algorithm for tuning reliable fuzzy logic controller","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/636718/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5761553","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D hyperbolic space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D hyperbolic space","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00636718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03852S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","isNumber":"13801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5034","citationCount":"103","articleId":"636718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":636757,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set, selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view operations.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5034/13801/00636761.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spreadsheet approach to information visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/636761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"A spreadsheet approach to information visualization","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5761555","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spreadsheet approach to information visualization","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00636761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043284S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","isNumber":"13801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5034","citationCount":"17","articleId":"636761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":636789,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We describe recent work on both aspects of the system, in particular a generalization of the data types laid out and the implementation of imageability features in a 2D visualization tool. The variety of data analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability features.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13801","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5034/13801/00636789.pdf","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636789","startPage":"73","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system to a financial institution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/636789/","displayDocTitle":"Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system to a financial institution","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5761563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system to a financial institution","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00636789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033607S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 1997","isNumber":"13801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5034","citationCount":"17","articleId":"636789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":636792,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

The special strength of parallel coordinates is in modeling relations. As an example, a simplified economic model is constructed with data from various economic sectors of a real country. The visual model shows the interelationship and dependencies between the sectors, circumstances where there is competition for the same resource, and feasible economic policies.

The current signals generated at both ends of feeder were used to evaluate the performance of the protection. These tests were carried out using a protection simulator. The results illustrate the effect of current transformer saturation on the sensitivity and stability of the protection. Finally it is shown that a precisely synchronized differential protection is fast, selective and accurate.

However, the second harmonic component in fault current is increased by the introduction of underground 500 kV lines. This paper describes a new method to discriminate internal fault from inrush current by the sum of active power flowing into transformers from each terminal. The average power is almost zero for energizing, but an internal fault consumes large power. To check the performance of this method, actual inrush current and voltage waveforms of a 500/154 kV transformer are accurately measured by digital equipment. The usefulness is confirmed by applying the method to the measured inrush and simulated fault data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/636909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5641028","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power differential method for discrimination between fault and magnetizing inrush current in transformers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power differential method for discrimination between fault and magnetizing inrush current in transformers","sourcePdf":"00636909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02492S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"129","articleId":"636909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":636910,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The introduced protection scheme contains several internal functions and coefficients which are subject to off-line pre-installation self-setting. Three unique procedures are delivered for self-adjusting the relay, and thus, making it self-organized.

The standard HBT used has an emitter area of 1.4/spl times/3.0 /spl mu/m; it has current gain of over 70 at I/sub c/=1 mA and f/sub T/ and f/sub MAX/ of over 50 GHz at I/sub c/=4 mA. The process also includes Schottky diodes, thin-film NiCr resistors, MIM capacitors and three levels of metal interconnect. The ADC uses an analog folding architecture to reduce transistor count and power well below that of a straight 6-bit flash ADC. It includes an on-chip track-and-hold (T/H) circuit and Gray-encoded digital outputs for best immunity to dynamic errors. The ADC's measured differential nonlinearity is less than /spl plusmn/0.5 LSB and its integral nonlinearity is less than /spl plusmn/0.8 LSB. It has a resolution bandwidth (the frequency at which effective bits has dropped by 0.5 bits) of 2.4 GHz at 3 GSa/s and 1.8 GHz at 4 GSa/s, higher than any ADC published to date. The chip operates at up to 6.5 GSa/s, but linearity at that clock rate is much worse.","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1994.636976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1994.636976","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE GaAs IC Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5013/13750/00636976.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE GaAs IC Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6-bit, 4 GSa/s ADC fabricated in a GaAs HBT process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 6-bit, 4 GSa/s ADC fabricated in a GaAs HBT process","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5098956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/636976/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6-bit, 4 GSa/s ADC fabricated in a GaAs HBT process","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00636976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027527S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5013","citationCount":"20","articleId":"636976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":636987,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The problem is stochastically formulated in order to account for randomness in individual charger start-time and battery state-of-charge. The authors introduce a model that allows for partial harmonics cancellation due to diversity in magnitudes and phase angles. A general solution technique is presented along with an example using data from a commercially available EV charger. Their results show that a limiting distribution of 7-10 chargers is adequate for accurately predicting harmonic injection currents using the central limit theorem. They also show that the expected values of net harmonic currents are considerably less than the peak values that would have been realized if the same number of chargers were operated in unison.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/13804/00637002.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.637002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.637002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=637002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical method for predicting the net harmonic currents generated by a concentration of electric vehicle battery chargers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Power system harmonics","Batteries","Electric vehicles","Voltage","Senior members","Harmonic analysis","Student members","Rivers","Power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","battery chargers","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle battery chargers","power system harmonic currents","statistical prediction method","charger start-time","battery state-of-charge","harmonics cancellation","harmonic injection currents","central limit theorem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"A statistical method for predicting the net harmonic currents generated by a concentration of electric vehicle battery chargers","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5641045","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical method for predicting the net harmonic currents generated by a concentration of electric vehicle battery chargers","sourcePdf":"00637002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050056S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"88","articleId":"637002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":637009,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.H.

It is possible to extend the sampling of apertures to the errors of numerical integration of an aperture, using either the trapezoidal or Simpson's rule.

Traditional diagnostic techniques have relied on physician experience, which is based on a data set chosen from his or her personal preferences, rather than from scientific merit. In this article, we show that there are alternative methods of selecting clinical variables on which to base a diagnosis. We suggest that a model-based technique utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to investigate alternative, objectively chosen data input sets. Traditionally, ANNs have been used for diagnosis or prediction tasks; however, this article introduces a novel method of exploring the inner structure of suitably trained ANNs to determine a set of key variables for each clinical state defined. Two different ANN techniques are proposed: self-organizing maps and backpropagation networks. We do not claim that these techniques provide the optimal data set for decision making, but we do show that other combinations of data exist that may be an improvement over the physician methods currently used.","doi":"10.1109/51.637116","startPage":"41","endPage":"47","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/51/13799/00637116.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.637116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using artificial neural networks for classifying ICU patient states","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Libraries","Databases","DH-HEMTs","Data mining","Blood","Biomedical engineering","Patient monitoring","Condition monitoring","Ethics Committee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patient care","self-organising feature maps","backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","medical diagnostic computing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","ICU patient state classification","critical disorder diagnosis","intensive care","physician experience","data set selection","personal preferences","clinical variables selection","model-based technique","objectively chosen data input sets","self-organizing maps","backpropagation networks","decision making"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Critical Care","Data Collection","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Finland","Heart Failure","Humans","Incidence","Neural Networks, Computer","Nonlinear Dynamics","Sepsis","Shock","Systems Integration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Using artificial neural networks for classifying ICU patient states","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5782553","pubMedId":"9399085","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using artificial neural networks for classifying ICU patient states","sourcePdf":"00637116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031976S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","isNumber":"13799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"11","articleId":"637116","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":637150,"authors":[{"name":"Weijun Yin","affiliation":["Phelps Dodge Magnet Wire Company"],"lastName":"Weijun Yin","id":"37614934000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0883-7554"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4402"}],"articleNumber":"637150","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":160,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":946},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society","url":"http://tdei.sju.edu/deis/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Partial discharges","Space charge","Voltage","Pulse width modulation","Wires","Pulse inverters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Space heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine insulation","PWM invertors","failure analysis","partial discharges","space charge","machine windings","motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure","winding insulation","inverter-fed motor","magnet wire","repetitive pulses","partial discharge","dielectric heating","space charge","PWM drive","voltage overshoot","rise time"]}],"abstract":"The failure of magnet wires under repetitive pulses as seen in inverter-fed motors cannot be attributed to a single factor but is a result of the combined effects of partial discharge, dielectric heating, and space charge formation. Voltage overshoots produced by PWM drives may be above discharge inception voltage. Partial discharge may therefore be present in inverter-fed motors. In addition to partial discharge, pulses with a fast rise time and high frequency enable the insulation to generate local dielectric heating, which increases the local temperature. The degradation rate of the insulation is therefore increased. Furthermore, the fast rise and fall of pulses make it possible for space charges to accumulate in the winding insulation and on its surface.","doi":"10.1109/57.637150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/57/13813/00637150.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/57.637150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure mechanism of winding insulations in inverter-fed motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=637150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637150/","displayDocTitle":"Failure mechanism of winding insulations in inverter-fed motors","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783756","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure mechanism of winding insulations in inverter-fed motors","sourcePdf":"637150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032687S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1997","isNumber":"13813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"57","citationCount":"160","articleId":"637150","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":637183,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Texture is a fertile source of information about the physical environment. Images of low density crowds tend to present coarse textures, while images of dense crowds tend to present fine textures.

Crowd density feature vectors are extracted from such images and used by a self organising neural network which is responsible for the crowd density estimation. Results obtained respectively to the estimation of the number of people in a specific area of Liverpool Street Railway Station in London (UK) are presented.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19970387","startPage":"11/1","endPage":"11/8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Image Processing for Security Applications (Digest No: 1997/074)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5054/13838/00637252.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Image Processing for Security Applications (Digest No: 1997/074)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19970387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of crowd density using image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowd density estimation","image processing","low density crowd images","coarse textures","dense crowds","fine textures","automatic estimation","automatic crowd monitoring","texture information","grey level transition probabilities","digitised images","crowd density feature vectors","feature extraction","self organising neural network","Liverpool Street Railway Station","London"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 March 1997","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of crowd density using image processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-10 March 1997","accessionNumber":"5584692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of crowd density using image processing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00637252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036169S","chronDate":"10-10 March 1997","isNumber":"13838","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5054","citationCount":"60","articleId":"637252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":637287,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

The methodology requires separate weights for excitatory and inhibitory contributions to a neuron's activation. In the test the excitatory and inhibitory weights are set to be equal, producing no net contribution to the activation. Any faults in the weight values result in an imbalance that is amplified by the neuron activation function and is easily detectable at the neuron output. Analysis is performed on the detection approach that includes fault detection thresholds as a function of neuron gain, network size, and weight perturbation. A methodology is outlined that uses the proposed testing approach followed by example test results.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.637287","startPage":"4023","endPage":"4028 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

We describe a large (macro) cell propagation channel and discuss different physical effects such as path loss, fading delay spread, angle spread, and Doppler spread. We also develop a signal model incorporating channel effects. Both forward-link (transmit) and reverse-link (receive) channels are considered and the relationship between the two is discussed. Single- and multiuser models are treated for four important space-time processing problems, and the underlying spatial and temporal structure are discussed as are different algorithmic approaches to reverse link space-time professing with blind and nonblind methods for single- and multiple-user cases. We cover forward-link space-time algorithms and we outline methods for estimation of multipath parameters. We also discuss applications of space-time processing to CDMA, applications of space-time techniques to current cellular systems, and industry trends.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5771852","volume":"14","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space-time processing for wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time processing for wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00637317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11738S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"696","articleId":"637317","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":637318,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the proper and accurate assignment of a global weight to each rule in an inference path by a domain expert is a difficult task. Usually the initial global weight values acquired during the knowledge acquisition phase are rough estimates, and they require fine-tuning or refinement later on. It is a time-consuming and repetitive task to refine the global weights manually. In this paper we propose using a neural network approach to address this knowledge refinement problem. It is shown that each type of FPR with its knowledge representation parameters can be mapped into a neural network to create a fuzzy expert network, which provides the full representation of the knowledge base of the FPR system and its inferencing capability as well. A new learning algorithm is developed to enable the network to adapt to the new architecture and to support the inferencing function. Our approach has the advantages that the refinement of global weights could be done automatically, and that refined global weights would allow the fuzzy expert system to achieve better performance in terms of increasing the degree of certainty of the final goal being drawn.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.637320","startPage":"4047","endPage":"4052 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

This work, in support of CAASD, attempts to outline the key attributes of CDMA communication systems, specifically direct-sequence spread spectrum systems. A brief comparison with more traditional multiple access schemes (TDMA and FDMA), is made and then direct-sequence CDMA modulation and demodulation for a simple transmitter and receiver, in a single \"cell\" environment, is described. The CDMA waveform description yields expressions which allow estimation of system capacity-the number of simultaneously active channels the system can support. Non-idealities such as additional (interfering) cells and imperfect power control are also considered. Finally, TDMA capacity expressions are reviewed and some comparative estimated capacity results for our VHF Air-Ground/Ground-Air application are shown, using waveforms based upon terrestrial cellular schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5883372","conferenceDate":"30-30 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"CDMA for communications in the aeronautical environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA for communications in the aeronautical environment","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00637327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039946S","chronDate":"26-30 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5023","citationCount":"7","articleId":"637327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":637335,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Usually the coding is obtained by a linear predictor LPC (or derivative LAR, LPCC) or by spectral analysis, as FFT, Cepstre or MECC. We propose to use a three layer neural network to learn phonemes extracted from the DARPA-TIMIT database. The network is designed to predict the next input signal value from the N previous ones. During the training stage, the first weight layer is the same for each phoneme. The second weight layer is different for each phoneme. In the generalization stage, the first weight layer remains fixed and initialized with those given by the training phase. When coding a test database phoneme, the output weight layer is trained to predict each phoneme values. The final neural predictive coding (NPC) corresponds to this second weight layer. We show that normalized coding can easily be obtained by using a nonlinear function of the weights instead of the weights themselves. Results are compared with others on temporal speech coding. A study of NPC by discriminant analysis and an application of MLP to phoneme recognition is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.637335","startPage":"4081","endPage":"4085 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Most conventional approaches to hand gesture recognition have employed data gloves, but for a more natural interface, hand gestures must be recognized from visual images without using any external devices. Our research is intended to draw and edit graphic elements by hand gestures. As a gesture is a continuous motion on a sequential time series, the HMM (hidden Markov model) must be a prominent recognition tool. The most important thing in hand gesture recognition is what the input features are that best represent the characteristics of the moving hand gesture. We consider a planar hand gesture in front of a camera and use 8-directional chain codes as input vectors. For training an HMM network, a simple context modeling method is embedded for training on a \"left-to-right\" HMM model. This model is applied to drawing and editing specified graphic elements. The overall objective is to recognize 12 different dynamic gestures. In our experiments, we have had good recognition results on a pre-confined test environment: (1) the spotting time is synchronized at the static state of a hand, (2) limb parts other than the hands are motionless, and (3) the change in the hand posture during movement is meaningless. Our system is to be advanced by adopting more diverse input features representing more dynamic features of hand gestures.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The benefits and disadvantages of using soft handoff over hard handoff are discussed, with most results drawn from the available literature. The two most well-known benefits are fade margin improvement and higher uplink capacity, while disadvantages include increased downlink interference and more complex implementation. Handoff parameter optimization is extremely important, so various studies on the trade-offs to be considered when selecting these parameters are surveyed, from both the link quality and resource allocation perspectives. Finally, research directions and future trends are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/13833/00637378.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/98.637378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.637378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=637378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft handoffs in CDMA mobile systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Relays","GSM","Signal processing algorithms","Communication system control","Switches","Interference","Mobile handsets","Picture archiving and communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication standards","radio links","channel capacity","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA mobile systems","soft handoff","IS-95 cellular phone standard","code-division multiple access","hard handoff","fade margin","uplink capacity","downlink interference","handoff parameter optimization","link quality","resource allocation","research"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Soft handoffs in CDMA mobile systems","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5810000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft handoffs in CDMA mobile systems","sourcePdf":"00637378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05531S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"140","articleId":"637378","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":637379,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This idea in part comes from a number of reported simulations which were based on the assumption that mobiles always connect to the nearest base station. We present analytical and simulation results for the case where mobiles are connected to the best base station (the one with the strongest signal). At the 10 percent outage level, it is shown that the nearest server scenario tends to underestimate the carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio by as much as 5 dB (with respect to the best server case). Some system imperfections which are not traditionally assessed by such simulations are further discussed. In particular, nonideal positioning of the base stations was found to have negligible impact on C/I if the traditional cellular rule-of-thumb criteria are obeyed. Nonuniform spatial distribution of the mobiles was analyzed based on real data from the Toronto area. It was found to have negligible impact on the average C/I performance. Blocking problems in such a case, however, could easily reduce the theoretical capacity with uniform loading by as much as 30 percent. Finally, C/I deteriorations due to nonideal handoffs are examined. This analysis is very sensitive to the handoff mechanism implementation details. Although the results for hand-offs should be regarded with some caution, in view of all the results presented in this article we feel that cellular systems are in general limited by blocking rather than by interference.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Base stations","Shadow mapping","Interchannel interference","Communication standards","Statistics","Mobile handsets","Telecommunication traffic","Frequency","Communication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband cellular systems capacity","interference-limited systems","blocking-limited systems","North American cellular industry","simulations","base station","simulation results","analytical results","outage level","best server","nearest server","carrier-to-interference ratio","system imperfections","nonideal positioning","cellular rule-of-thumb criteria","nonuniform spatial distribution","real data","Toronto area","average C/I performance","blocking problems","uniform loading","C/I deteriorations","nonideal handoffs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/98.637382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/13833/00637382.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.637382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of present narrowband cellular systems: interference-limited or blocking-limited","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=637382","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of present narrowband cellular systems: interference-limited or blocking-limited","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637382/","volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5810004","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of present narrowband cellular systems: interference-limited or blocking-limited","sourcePdf":"00637382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030049S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"13","articleId":"637382","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":637387,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To date most work has focused upon building algorithmic models of effort, for example COCOMO. These can be calibrated to local environments. We describe an alternative approach to estimation based upon the use of analogies. The underlying principle is to characterize projects in terms of features (for example, the number of interfaces, the development method or the size of the functional requirements document). Completed projects are stored and then the problem becomes one of finding the most similar projects to the one for which a prediction is required. Similarity is defined as Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space where n is the number of project features. Each dimension is standardized so all dimensions have equal weight. The known effort values of the nearest neighbors to the new project are then used as the basis for the prediction. The process is automated using a PC-based tool known as ANGEL. The method is validated on nine different industrial datasets (a total of 275 projects) and in all cases analogy outperforms algorithmic models based upon stepwise regression. From this work we argue that estimation by analogy is a viable technique that, at the very least, can be used by project managers to complement current estimation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/32.637387","pdfPath":"/iel3/32/13834/00637387.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.637387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating software project effort using analogies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Estimating software project effort using analogies","volume":"23","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5812219","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating software project effort using analogies","sourcePdf":"00637387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028552S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"529","articleId":"637387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":637388,"authors":[{"name":"Dar-Tzen Peng","affiliation":["Real Time Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Dar-Tzen Peng","id":"37377949700"},{"name":"K.G.

The solution is optimal in the sense of minimizing the maximum normalized task response time, called the system hazard, subject to the precedence constraints resulting from intercommunication among the tasks to be allocated. Minimization of the system hazard ensures that the solution algorithm allocates tasks so as to meet all task deadlines under an optimal schedule, whenever such an allocation exists. The task system is modeled with a task graph (TG), in which computation and communication modules, communication delays and intertask precedence constraints are clearly described. Tasks described by this TG are assigned to PNs by using a branch-and-bound (B&B) search algorithm. The algorithm traverses a search tree whose leaves correspond to potential solutions to the task allocation problem. We use a bounding method that prunes, in polynomial time, nonleaf vertices that cannot lead to an optimal solution, while ensuring that the search path leading to an optimal solution will never be pruned. For each generated leaf vertex, we compute the exact cost using the algorithm developed by Peng and Shin (1993). The lowest-cost leaf vertex (one with the least system hazard) represents an optimal task allocation. Computational experiences and examples are provided to demonstrate the concept, utility and power of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/32.637388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"745","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/32/13835/00637388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.637388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assignment and scheduling communicating periodic tasks in distributed real-time systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Delay","Hazards","Optimal scheduling","Costs","Processor scheduling","Computer Society","Minimization methods","Scheduling algorithm","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","real-time systems","processor scheduling","resource allocation","minimisation","tree searching","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communicating periodic tasks","task assignment","task scheduling","distributed real-time systems","heterogeneous processing nodes","maximum normalized task response time minimization","system hazard","branch-and-bound search algorithm","task intercommunication","task deadlines","optimal schedule","task graph","computation modules","communication modules","communication delays","intertask precedence constraints","search tree traversal","bounding method","polynomial time algorithm","nonleaf vertex pruning","exact cost computation","lowest-cost leaf vertex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Assignment and scheduling communicating periodic tasks in distributed real-time systems","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5812220","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637388/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assignment and scheduling communicating periodic tasks in distributed real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00637388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051322S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"92","articleId":"637388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":637508,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Yuanhui","affiliation":["The national key laboratory of Intelligence technology and system, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Yuanhui","id":"37087436245"},{"name":"Lu Yuchang","affiliation":["The national key laboratory of Intelligence technology and system, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lu Yuchang","id":"37087277916"},{"name":"Shi Chunyi","affiliation":["The national key laboratory of Intelligence technology and system, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shi Chunyi","id":"37087436606"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4053-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"637508","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=637508","abstract":"Classification, which involves finding rules that partition a given data set into disjoint groups, is one class of data mining problems.

By use of the voltage collapse margin (VCM) method, a self-organizing network is trained to give the power margin of the weak area of power systems from voltage collapse. Based on a Kohonen network which consists of a Kohonen and backpropagation network, the self-organizing network clusters input patterns with similar features and hence increase the efficiency of training phase. The generalization capability of the self-organizing network can cope with vagarious load/generation patterns which have not been encountered during the training phase. The effectiveness of the proposed network has been demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19960258","startPage":"171","endPage":"175","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Power System Control and Management (Conf.

Hydraulic pressure variations in each of three flexible tubes (bellows) in each finger create a bending moment, and consequent motion or increase in contact force during grasping. Such fingers have inherent passive compliance, no moving parts, and are naturally depth pressure-compensated, making them ideal for reliable use in the deep ocean. In addition to the mechanical design, development of the hand has also considered closed loop finger position and force control, coordinated finger motion for grasping, force and slip sensor development/signal processing, and reactive world modeling/planning for supervisory 'blind grasping'. Initially, the application focus is for marine science tasks, but broader roles in offshore oil and gas, salvage, and military use are foreseen.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/100.637804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/100/13824/00637804.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"45","doi":"10.1109/100.637804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMADEUS: advanced manipulation for deep underwater sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"AMADEUS: advanced manipulation for deep underwater sampling","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5823764","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/637804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMADEUS: advanced manipulation for deep underwater sampling","sourcePdf":"00637804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035966S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"92","articleId":"637804","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":637882,"authors":[{"name":"V.

One solution is to model the system with two neural networks in parallel whereby one network is trained a priori with a wide range of historical dynamics while the second one, is allowed to adapt itself to make up the differences between the first model and the real-time dynamics. Within this scheme, as the second network is called to adapt itself, the first one can be progressively trained to learn the new dynamics without adversely affecting the old training. A strategy of this type can be achieved very effectively the modified probabilistic neural network because it is constructed with local radial kernel functions and its adaptation mechanism is computationally simple and very fast. This is demonstrated using a complex nonlinear system whose characteristics suddenly change after initial training and then switch back to the original characteristics. Comparisons are made with other networks to show the important advantages of the modified probabilistic neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.638082","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1027 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The schemes are especially useful for encryption of large amounts of data, such as digital images or electronic databases. A chaotic map is first generalized by introducing parameters and then discretized to a finite square lattice of points which represent pixels or some other data items. Although the discretized map is a permutation and thus cannot be chaotic, it shares certain sensitivity and mixing properties with its continuous counterpart as long as the number of iterations remains small. It is shown that for the 2D baker map the permutations behave as typical random permutations. The discretized map is further extended to 3D and composed with a simple diffusion mechanism. As a result, a block product encryption scheme is obtained. To encrypt an N/spl times/N image, the ciphering map is iteratively applied to the image. This paper is an extension of the work of Pichler and Scharinger (1994, 1996) who first introduced encryption schemes based on 2D baker map.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4942/13802/00638097.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1110 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

If the driving inputs to the system are known, and certain characteristic shapes are expected for the response, then those features can be reconstructed. In order to capture the localized frequency details, wavelet coefficients are added to the first layer of a multilayer feedforward neural network. TDET predictions and real emissions are used to train this hybrid network, and then it is asked to reconstruct the details of future emissions when the engine calibration and environment are changed. The method is expected to be implementable online and in plenty of time for anticipatory control efforts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638098/","accessionNumber":"5760933","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear forecasting with wavelet neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear forecasting with wavelet neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00638098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029206S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4942","citationCount":"3","articleId":"638098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":638102,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Sang Park","affiliation":["Computer Engine ring and Computer Science Department, University of Missouri Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Jae-Sang Park","id":"37066790300"},{"name":"J.M.

Both theoretical and computational results of the two wavelet transforms are discussed. The major difference between the two wavelet transforms is the computational procedure. So far, only the semi-orthogonal wavelet transform of Cai and Wang can compute wavelet coefficients from a coarse scale level to a fine scale level, which makes the computation more flexible and cost effective. However, the compactly supported biorthogonal wavelet transform of Cohen et al. Has better decorrelation property. Thus, we found that the semi-orthogonal wavelet transform of Cai and Wang provides a faster computation process while the compactly supported biorthogonal wavelet transform provides better predicted wavelet coefficients in our experimental results. Based on the wavelet coefficients computed from signals, nonlinear prediction models utilizing recurrent neural networks are applied to predict wavelet coefficients at each scale level, Thus, the predicted signal is obtained from the reconstruction of predicted wavelet coefficients, In our experiments, the multi-step prediction using wavelet transforms gives much superior results than those obtained without using wavelet transforms.

However, it becomes important, when the inner states of the load connected to the inverter has to be calculated using the quantities of the load terminal voltages and currents, such as in the case of vector control of the induction motor without speed sensor. This paper tries to give an accurate measuring method for it. The voltage cluster from the inverter is integrated every half period of the switching. Then the output of the integrator will be reset to zero after its volt-second value has been detected digitally. Two groups of the circuit take the alternative operation. High accuracy and linearity of the measurement can be achieved. The measurement of the instantaneous current has also been discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.1997.638361","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/5036/13809/00638361.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"884 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.1997.638361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate measurement of instantaneous voltage for power electronics circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638361/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate measurement of instantaneous voltage for power electronics circuits","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781366","conferenceDate":"6-6 Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate measurement of instantaneous voltage for power electronics circuits","confLoc":"Nagaoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00638361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030394S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5036","citationCount":"9","articleId":"638361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":638363,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon-Sik Kim","affiliation":["Intelligent Control and Dynamic Simulation Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoon-Sik Kim","id":"37087196175"},{"name":"Woong-Gie Han","affiliation":["Intelligent Control and Dynamic Simulation Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Woong-Gie Han","id":"37087196086"},{"name":"Tae-Yong Kuc","affiliation":["Intelligent Control and Dynamic Simulation Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Yong Kuc","id":"37087182646"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4053-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"638363","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Missiles","Genetic algorithms","Aerodynamics","Optimal control","Intelligent control","Automatic control","Control systems","Neural networks","Error correction","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["missile control","intelligent control","H/sup /spl infin control","genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent missile autopilot","STT missiles","multiple controllers","mixed H/sub 2//H/sub /spl infin// control technique","genetic searching algorithm","automatic switching","error based switching scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.638363","pdfPath":"/iel3/4942/13802/00638363.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Combi-IC TDA 16888 includes the pulse width modulated (PWM) control for a SMPS and the control for the preconverter to improve the power factor and to reduce the harmonics of the AC input current. Both sections are internally synchronized on the same operating frequency. The preferred topology of the PFC-preconverter is boost, but flyback is also possible. The PWM section can be designed as a forward or as a flyback converter. Maximum duty cycle of the PFC is about 95%, in order to achieve minimal line current gaps. Maximum duty cycle of the PWM is limited to 50% to prevent transformer saturation. In normal operation the PFC section operates with dual loop control. A first control loop controls the shape of the line current by average current control enabling either continuous or discontinuous operation mode. The second loop controls the DC bus voltage. There is a third control loop available that enables the PFC section as an auxiliary power supply even during disabling the PWM section. In this paper the PFC preconverter, PWM converter, PFC and PWM gate drive, and oscillator and synchronisation are described.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.1997.638370","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/5036/13809/00638370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.1997.638370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13809","startPage":"901","endPage":"906 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power factor and PWM controller TDA 16888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power factor and PWM controller TDA 16888","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638370/","conferenceDate":"6-6 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781370","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power factor and PWM controller TDA 16888","confLoc":"Nagaoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00638370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069088S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5036","citationCount":"2","articleId":"638370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":638374,"authors":[{"name":"Gui-Jia Su","affiliation":["Sanken Electric Company Limited, Kawagoe, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Gui-Jia Su","id":"37269388700"},{"name":"T.

Adaptive antenna arrays are used to increase link capacity, improve coverage and permit less stringent power control. Adaptive beamforming algorithms are crucial to the success of the smart antennas. The existing beamforming methods are found to be far from satisfactory for DS/CDMA in the urban multipath environment where user signals are very dissimilar in strength and perfect power control is hardly possible. This paper proposes a new decision-directed beamforming algorithm for CDMA with noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation which performs very well in typical CDMA environments. We introduce a quality measure of a symbol decision and a criterion for picking good weights and rejecting bad weights during the process of adaptation. With incorporating the measure into the least-squares algorithm, we can select weights in a positive manner such that the beamformer is forced to keep track of its optimum weights. The advantages of the proposed algorithm include: (1) an amount of immunity to the near-far effect; (2) the ability of tracking the optimum weight vector in the context of time-variant channels; (3) insensitivity to decision errors; (4) good convergence property; (5) the ability of working in low SNR scenarios; (6) tolerance to timing errors between the antennas; (7) mild synchronization requirement, and (8) computational simplicity.

The possible data rates are 1200, 2400, 4800, and 9600 bits per second (bps). The data rate information is not transmitted in order to reduce the overhead in a frame. The existing mobile station receiver employs four Viterbi decoders for all possible data rates, and uses the output of a decoder with minimum errors. The Viterbi decoding process for each data rate takes significant complexity in the MT receiver design. This paper improves the complexity of the IS-95 CDMA MT receiver. In this paper an efficient data rate estimation scheme is presented before Viterbi decoding, and one Viterbi decoder instead of four is proposed to be employed with the estimated data rate.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.638399","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

In particular, we focus on channel coding and optimal power control for reverse link transmission using Hadamard-Walsh (H-W) orthogonal sequences for noncoherent demodulation. Because of various multimedia traffic types with different quality of service (QoS) requirements, the concept of perfect power control for voice only DS-CDMA networks cannot be directly applied to the multimedia wireless network. Under the circumstances, we give a new definition to the optimal power control and discuss how to achieve it together with error control techniques in order to maximize the frequency bandwidth efficiency and to guarantee various QoS requirements. Numerical results are presented to evaluate (i) the optimal signal to interference ratio of the received signals at base stations with various transmission accuracy requirements and (ii) the system radio frequency spectrum efficiency versus BER requirement under the assumption of the optimal power control. It is shown that the spectral efficiency (and hence the system capacity) can be significantly increased when using the optimal power control and convolutional coding with ARQ protocol for delay insensitive traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Thus, the performance of the decorrelating and the PIC multiuser receivers operating in frequency selective fading channels is compared. A decision-directed (DD) multiuser channel estimation based both on prediction and smoothing is presented. It is observed through computer simulations that from low to moderate SNRs, the PIC outperforms the decorrelator. The PIC is, however, more sensitive to channel estimation errors than the decorrelator, and at high channel loads it suffers from BER saturation, whereas the decorrelator does not.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The result is a generalization of the transfer function bounds and remains useful for a wider range of signal to noise ratios, particularly for some range below the channel cut-off rate.

The basic scheme is an adaptive nonlinear predictor that consists of an (N+1)-level quantizer, an adaptive linear filter, and two adders, where N is the number of users in the CDMA system. The first enhanced scheme is an adaptive nonlinear interpolator, and the second one is an adaptive nonlinear predictor with offset outputs; both involve a little bit more complexity than the basic scheme, and have their own distinct features in performance. Computer simulation results show that all the proposed approaches have much better performance than the conventional linear filtering approach. As compared to the approximate conditional mean (ACM) nonlinear filter, they also achieve similar performance when the SNR is large enough, but involve much less computational/hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.638412","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

Based on tracking trellis survivor paths in the decoding decision process using a backward labels technique, rather than the traditional forward labels technique, and exploiting a `shift register' property of the trellis decoder, memory savings are achievable without loss of decoding performance.

Numerical computation of this expression is limited by the issues of complexity, efficiency and accuracy. As a result, a combined PDF approach for the forward link and a mean-method technique for the reverse link are proposed to reduce the computational complexity and increase the accuracy, significantly. The essential theory in deriving the simplified BER expressions for both links is presented. Observation on the simplified expressions shows that the computational effort for these two approaches grows only linearly with the number of interfering cells in the system regardless of the number of active mobiles in the cell. Finally, comparison with simulation shows that the results obtained are very accurate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient evaluation of cellular CDMA over a Rayleigh-faded channel","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

For an L=3 multipath/finger multicode receiver demodulating a quarter of the total downlink channels, the MNC-PD detector provides a 9% increase in downlink capacity compared to a conventional detector.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.638458","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

However, the applicability of such schemes to future cellular and PCS systems will depend on their ability to cope with the severe time variations characteristic of a wireless channel. We address this issue in the context of Rayleigh faded DS-CDMA signals. Our main results are as follows. (a) Standard decision directed (DD) MMSE adaptation following some initial training is unable to track a typical fading channel. (b) A modified DD (MDD) MMSE adaptation that exploits differential encoding and decoding to simplify the task of tracking is robust against fading and the near-far problem. (c) MDD-MMSE adaptation survives the arrival of new interfering transmissions even in the presence of a severe near-far problem. (d) The performance of the MDD-MMSE algorithm shows some deterioration when there are several rapidly fading independent multipath components, so that further investigation is needed for devising adaptive algorithms for this setting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression for direct sequence CDMA over severely time-varying channels","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

It distinguishes between a moving foreground and a static background, but image segmentation might also be based on other sources. The regions are encoded in separate layers using a chroma-keying technique that allows a controlled lossy recovery of the boundaries. A 3D-wavelet transform is applied to a group of frames of the predictor residual signal. Statistical dependencies of the transform coefficients extracted from different image subbands are captured by conditional probability models. Without the layered coding, the system has a superior performance compared to the H.263 standard for very low bit-rate coding. The layered coding causes a small degradation in visual quality at the same bit-rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.638611","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4998/13789/00638611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.638611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13789","startPage":"776","endPage":"779 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-based motion compensated 3D-wavelet transform coding of video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Region-based motion compensated 3D-wavelet transform coding of video","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638611/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5899988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-based motion compensated 3D-wavelet transform coding of video","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00638611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073045S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"8","articleId":"638611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":638616,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Ying Kuo","affiliation":["Integrated Media Systems Center and Department of Electrical Engineering Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"lastName":"Tien-Ying Kuo","id":"37365183700"},{"name":"C.C.

With this scheme, the encoder can determine the block mode under the tradeoff of complexity and visual quality. Furthermore, the motion bit rate can be reduced by smoothing the motion field of BMC blocks during motion search. Experimental results show that the complexity of both the encoder and the decoder is reduced while the visual quality remains as good as the pure OBMC system.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.638616","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4998/13789/00638616.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"798 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.638616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid BMC/OBMC motion compensation scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638616/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid BMC/OBMC motion compensation scheme","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5899993","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid BMC/OBMC motion compensation scheme","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00638616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049011S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"2","articleId":"638616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":638619,"authors":[{"name":"Sheu-Chih Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheu-Chih Cheng","id":"37613865500"},{"name":"Hsueh-Ming Hang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsueh-Ming Hang","id":"37276446500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8183-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"638619","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video codecs","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Very large scale integration","Control systems","Video coding","Image quality","Optimal control","Rate-distortion","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video codecs","VLSI","digital signal processing chips","buffer storage","video coding","discrete cosine transforms","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate control algorithms","video codec hardware design","system-level VLSI design","video coding","image quality","optimal rate-distortion performance","performance","VLSI implementation","picture quality","internal buffer size","hardware cost","DCT coefficients"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an evaluation of rate control algorithms from a system-level VLSI design viewpoint.

Alpha is used as a quality factor in quartz. Sawyer has developed the alphagraph as our standard method of infrared measurement. The alphagraph is a measurement of alpha as a function of the position along the major growth direction (Z) of the crystal. The FTIR essentially looks at the entire spectrum (about 400 cm/sup -1/ to 4000 cm/sup -1/) in one pass. Since the measurement is not instantaneous, the sample cannot be moved during the measurement. An alphagraph is made by measuring the entire spectrum at a point, moving the sample a small amount, and repeating. The wavenumbers of interest are then plotted versus position. A custom sample handling and data collection system has been developed to perform these alphagraphs. The optimal settings, including aperture size and step size, have been determined. Results have been compared at the three wavenumbers most typically used in alpha determination. The spectrometer has been calibrated versus the standards from the International Round Robin in Infrared Alpha Measurements. The spectrometer shows good agreement with the standards and good reproducibility over long periods of time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5037/13811/00638654.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"535","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1997.638654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1997.638654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for alpha determination of quartz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Infrared spectra","Spectroscopy","Measurement standards","Extinction coefficients","Q factor","Standards development","Position measurement","Motion measurement","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transform spectroscopy","quartz","Q-factor","crystal resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","quartz","infrared extinction coefficient","quality factor","alphagraph","major growth direction","wavenumbers","sample handling","data collection system","aperture size","reproducibility","SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for alpha determination of quartz","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5828103","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30-30 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for alpha determination of quartz","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00638654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069796S","chronDate":"28-30 May 1997","isNumber":"13811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5037","citationCount":"3","articleId":"638654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":638662,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Quantization noise feedback at the encoder (\"closed-loop coding\") has several advantages compared to \"open-loop coding\" where noise feedback is not included. Finding optimal bit allocations for closed-loop coders is a complex task since the rate-distortion (R-D) performance of one quantizer depends on the selected operational points of all previous ones. We present simplified models for closed-loop and open-loop coding. From those, analytical solutions to the optimal bit allocation problem can be derived. In the optimal case, closed-loop coding outperforms open-loop coding although distortion in lower resolution layers of the closed-loop coder may become rather high which is undesirable in scalable coding applications. In this case it turns out to be a good solution to use an optimal open-loop bit allocation for closed-loop coding. Theoretical results are verified by coding experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.638662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.638662","startPage":"17","endPage":"20 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4998/13789/00638662.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit allocation methods for closed-loop coding of oversampled pyramid decompositions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Bit allocation methods for closed-loop coding of oversampled pyramid decompositions","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5894152","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638662/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit allocation methods for closed-loop coding of oversampled pyramid decompositions","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00638662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038941S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"6","articleId":"638662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":638674,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangtao Wen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"lastName":"Jiangtao Wen","id":"37291696100"},{"name":"J.D.

First, the reliability metric is computed for all the matching blocks in the target image and then, based on this value and its dependency on the direction, four neighboring matching blocks are checked whether they should be integrated or not. Finally, motion vectors are estimated for the integrated matching blocks by the block matching technique. Since the block integration is performed only for flat matching blocks or those with a simple edge, the coherence is improved while the performance of motion compensation is kept as far as possible.

Nevertheless, this cost is still too high for real time implementation on FGGA circuits. Here, we optimized both the algorithmic and architectural aspects of the original Deriche filter. A new organization of the filter is proposed at the 2D and 1D levels which reduces the memory size and the computation cost by a factor of two for both software and hardware implementations. We prove that the use of only 3 bits to code the scale parameter does not reduce the quality. The result from this choice is that the first order recursive filter which is the basic block of the entire architecture can be built with only 4 adders.

In this method, the condition of facial muscles is assigned to a hidden state of a HMM for each expression. Then, the probability of the state is updated according to a feature vector obtained from image processing. Image processing is performed in two steps. First, a velocity vector is estimated from every two successive frames by using an optical flow algorithm. Then, a two-dimensional Fourier transform is applied to a velocity vector field at the regions around an eye and the mouth. The coefficients for lower frequencies are selected to form a feature vector. A mixture density is used for approximating the output probability of the HMM so as to represent a variation in facial expressions among persons. To cope with the case when two expressions are displayed continuously, the HMM computation is modified such that when the peak of a facial motion is detected, a new sequence of facial expressions is assumed to start from the previous frame with minimal facial motion. Experiments show that a mixture density is effective because the recognition accuracy improves as the number of mixtures increases. In addition, the method correctly recognizes a facial expression that continuously follows another one.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=638829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Hidden Markov models","Image processing","Facial muscles","Image motion analysis","Fourier transforms","Mouth","Frequency","Computer displays","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","hidden Markov models","feature extraction","image sequences","probability","motion estimation","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial expressions recognition","HMM","automatic extraction","image sequences","facial muscles","hidden state","state probability","feature vector","image processing","eye","optical flow algorithm","two-dimensional Fourier transform","velocity vector field","mouth","coefficients","mixture density","output probability","facial motion detection","experiments","recognition accuracy"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4998/13789/00638829.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"549 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.638829","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.638829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing multiple persons' facial expressions using HMM based on automatic extraction of significant frames from image sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/638829/","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing multiple persons' facial expressions using HMM based on automatic extraction of significant frames from image sequences","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5899930","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing multiple persons' facial expressions using HMM based on automatic extraction of significant frames from image sequences","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00638829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047153S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"32","articleId":"638829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":638830,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These two subnetworks are trained in an on-line mode utilizing the backpropagation method. The use of a single-element error vector along with a small network simplifies the learning algorithm in terms of computation time.

Unlike the familiar methods of WW transducers optimization, our algorithm rates an IDT structure on the best satisfaction of its specifications not in the time but in the frequency domain. This approach has advantages over known methods in the case of synthesis of broadband WW transducers. Here the last algorithm modification is discussed. It can optimize WW transducers with an asymmetrical time response. This extension of algorithm possibilities allows not only to attain better transducer selectivity than in case of symmetrical WW electrode structures but to synthesize withdrawal weighted IDTs with a specified form of its phase response or of frequency dependence of group delay time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Acoustic transducers","Acoustic waves","Filters","Optimization methods","Frequency domain analysis","Time factors","Electrodes","Frequency dependence","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface acoustic wave transducers","surface acoustic wave filters","interdigital transducers","optimisation","frequency-domain synthesis","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthesis algorithm","broadband SAW transducers","withdrawal weighted SAW transducers","specified phase response","specified amplitude response","selectivity improvement","surface acoustic waves filters","input apodized IDT","interdigital transducers","output withdrawal weighted IDT","optimization","asymmetrical time response","algorithm modification","group delay time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1997.639198","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5037/13811/00639198.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1997.639198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis algorithm of broadband withdrawal weighted SAW transducers with specified amplitude and phase responses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis algorithm of broadband withdrawal weighted SAW transducers with specified amplitude and phase responses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639198/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5835088","conferenceDate":"30-30 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis algorithm of broadband withdrawal weighted SAW transducers with specified amplitude and phase responses","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00639198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026473S","chronDate":"28-30 May 1997","isNumber":"13811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5037","citationCount":"3","articleId":"639198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":639208,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.A.

This paper describes a set of design rules which are general and can be used to produce oscillators with very low noise performance where both additive (thermal noise) and flicker noise are considered. Linear theories are described which accurately describe the noise performance of resonator type oscillators. The limits set by varactor diodes on the noise performance in tuneable oscillators are described and the noise degradation caused by open loop phase error is shown. Several design examples are included and these show close correlation with the theory.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1997.639208","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5037/13811/00639208.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1997.639208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A review of low noise oscillator.

In the literature dedicated to the principles of DDFS, the authors show the change of the stored phase information in the accumulator, via ROM lookup tables, into nice staircase sine waves. However, for normalized frequencies X/Y set approximately, e.g., to 1/3 the output wave is defined only for three phase points and its form is more rectangular (or triangular) than sinusoidal. In addition, in these cases large \"quasi-amplitude\" modulations are encounted. Here, the author pays attention to the origin of these particular problems which are more widespread that one might expect.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1997.639219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1997.639219","startPage":"975","endPage":"979","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5037/13811/00639219.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Frequency Control Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase and amplitude disturbances in direct digital frequency synthesizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Phase and amplitude disturbances in direct digital frequency synthesizers","conferenceDate":"30-30 May 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5828150","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639219/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase and amplitude disturbances in direct digital frequency synthesizers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00639219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027026S","chronDate":"28-30 May 1997","isNumber":"13811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5037","citationCount":"6","articleId":"639219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":639240,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper describes three example systems which we have developed or are developing: car following, lane detection, and stereo vision. With the car following system, a driver pushes a button when he or she has a car in front which he/she would like to follow. The vehicle speed is controlled automatically using a vision system to keep a constant distance to the car in front. This system is described together with the lane sensing systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-effective vision systems for intelligent vehicles","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639467","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639467.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective vision systems for intelligent vehicles","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917163","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective vision systems for intelligent vehicles","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03761S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"5","articleId":"639467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":639472,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

Road and object recognition is performed both in a look-ahead and in a look-back region; this allows an internal servo-maintained representation of the entire situation around the vehicle using the 4D approach to dynamic machine vision. Obstacles are detected and tracked both in the forward and in the backward viewing range up to about 100 meters distance; depending on the computing power available for this purpose up to 4 or 5 objects may be tracked in parallel in each hemisphere. A fixation type viewing direction control with the capability of saccadic shifts of viewing direction for attention focussing has been developed. The overall system comprises about 60 transputers of T-222 and T-800. Beside a PC as transputer host all other processors in VaMoRs-P are transputers. A description of the parallel processing architecture is given; the system integration follows the well proven paradigm of orientation towards 4D physical objects and expectations with prediction error feedback. This allows frequent data driven bottom-up and model driven top-down integration steps for efficient and robust object tracking.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639472.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The seeing passenger car 'VaMoRs-P'","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Vehicle dynamics","Image processing","Parallel processing","Feedback","Remotely operated vehicles","System testing","Control systems","Eyes","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","computer vision","tracking","navigation","parallel processing","object recognition","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VaMoRs-P","EUREKA-project","Pometheus III","passenger car","Mercedes 500 SEL","computer vision","obstacles detection","object tracking","viewing direction control","attention focussing","transputers","parallel processing architecture","prediction error feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"The seeing passenger car 'VaMoRs-P'","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917168","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The seeing passenger car 'VaMoRs-P'","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035966S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"106","articleId":"639472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":639478,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These methods are using an edge histogram method based on the model based vision concept. The edge histogram method can detect line elements of the objects stably with low calculation cost. When the region of interests for the preceding vehicle and road lanes in the image are established and their projected edge histograms are observed in time series order, we can recognize them. Furthermore, we apply Kalman filter to their motions and predict their locations for time series detection. Using this stable recognition, we derive a collision time to control the on-board brake system. We show the performance of these methods by experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639478.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preceding vehicle and road lanes recognition methods for RCAS using vision system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Road vehicles","Machine vision","Image edge detection","Histograms","Collision avoidance","Object detection","Costs","Image recognition","Motion detection","Road accidents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","computer vision","edge detection","time series","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road lanes recognition","vehicle recognition","vision system","rear-end collision avoidance system","edge histogram","model based vision concept","line elements detection","time series","Kalman filter","collision time","brake system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Preceding vehicle and road lanes recognition methods for RCAS using vision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preceding vehicle and road lanes recognition methods for RCAS using vision system","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030232S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"7","articleId":"639478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":639482,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The input to ARCADE consists of edge point locations and orientations extracted from an image, and it performs the estimation without the need for any prior perceptual grouping of the edge points into individual lane boundaries. It is able to achieve this through the use of global constraints on the individual lane boundary shapes derived from an explicit model of road structure in the world. The use of the least median squares robust estimation technique allows the algorithm to function correctly in cases where up to 50% of the input edge data points are contaminating noise. Two applications of ARCADE as the first stage of processing for a lane sensing task are described: 1) the extraction of the locations of the features defining the visible lane structure of the road; and 2) the generation of training instances for an ALVINN-like neural network road follower.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639482.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting road curvature and orientation from image edge points without perceptual grouping into features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Roads","Shape","Noise robustness","Layout","Cameras","Noise shaping","Signal generators","Neural networks","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","feature extraction","computer vision","navigation","edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road curvature extraction","image edge points","ARCADE","road curvature estimation","direction estimation","tangential road orientation","global constraints","lane boundary","least median squares","feature extraction","neural network road follower","road vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Extracting road curvature and orientation from image edge points without perceptual grouping into features","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917175","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting road curvature and orientation from image edge points without perceptual grouping into features","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028901S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"92","articleId":"639482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":639489,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Autonomous vehicle following is defined as a vehicle controlling its own steering and speed while following a lead vehicle. The strength of the developed controller is that no characterization of vehicle dynamics is needed. As a result it can be transported to any vehicle regardless of its nonlinear and often unobservable dynamics. Data for the range and heading angle of the lead vehicle were collected for various paths with a human driver performing the vehicle following control function. The data was collected for different driving maneuvers including straight paths, lane changing and right/left turns. Two time-delay backpropagation neural networks were then trained based on the data obtained under manual control, one network for speed control and the other for steering control. After training, the vehicle following was done using the trained neural network controller. The results obtained and presented on a video tape indicate that it is feasible to employ a neural network to satisfactorily perform autonomous vehicle following.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639502","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639502.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transportable neural network controller for autonomous vehicle following","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A transportable neural network controller for autonomous vehicle following","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917189","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transportable neural network controller for autonomous vehicle following","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041393S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"5","articleId":"639502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":639514,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The system is installed in a test vehicle of Daimler-Benz that operates autonomously on European highways and performs a vision based environmental analysis that includes, among others, road tracking, obstacle detection, lane traffic analysis and traffic sign recognition. Within the traffic sign recognition the authors' group provides a real-time detection and classification of traffic signs. The authors' traffic sign classifier (TSC) is based on the color segmentation system CSC (Color Structure Code) developed in their group. The authors present details of their latest CSC-evaluation strategies for the TSC. The authors have succeeded in developing a feature space for the localization of all traffic sign candidates. The main features of an object are the typical color, its form and the inclusion of certain forms and colors. The feature space allows a fast classification of the traffic sign candidates following a hierarchical decision graph. The overall decision of whether it is a traffic sign or not is made by a fuzzy control system handling the probabilities of all the single decisions. In addition the authors present several statistical evaluations for some thousands of images that will show the quality of their TSC. For a real-time behavior the authors tested different hardware components (C40, Motorola PC601, T 805) in a TIP system (transputer image processing) and they explain the results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","System testing","Performance analysis","Remotely operated vehicles","Road vehicles","Mobile robots","Road transportation","Performance evaluation","Vehicle detection","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","computer vision","decision theory","image classification","image segmentation","image colour analysis","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic sign recognition","Daimler-Benz AG","PROMETHEUS","European highways","vision based environmental analysis","road tracking","obstacle detection","lane traffic analysis","real-time detection","traffic sign classifier","color segmentation system","Color Structure Code","hierarchical decision graph","fuzzy control syste","statistical evaluations","real-time behavior"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639514","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639514.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results on traffic sign recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New results on traffic sign recognition","accessionNumber":"4917198","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results on traffic sign recognition","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043122S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"45","articleId":"639514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":639531,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Road/lane segmentation is used to select ROI where obstacle detection algorithms are applied. This segmentation is made up of a temporal filter, an edge detector and a watershed transformation. It produces a marker of the current traffic lane. This marker is then used for calculating a road model which is continuously updated. The obstacle detection uses various criteria: existence of a darker region marking a vehicle, size and contrast of obstacles and symmetry. These two processes use the watershed transformation which is usually the slowest part of the segmentation. To speed it up, a very efficient enhancement of the algorithm, based on anamorphosis, is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917206","displayDocTitle":"Road segmentation and obstacle detection by a fast watershed transformation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road segmentation and obstacle detection by a fast watershed transformation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025404S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"47","articleId":"639531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":639534,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The stereo algorithm is derived from the second algorithm of Marr (1979) by using local extrema extracted from DoG filtered images as matching primitives, instead of zero-crossing points. The DoG filter is realized by a extremely simple and precise capacitive IIR 2D spatial Gaussian filter, using only C and switching MOS-the most precise elements in CMOS technology. This capacitive network is much more precise than other implementations and simplifies considerably the algorithm-hardware conversion. The matching primitives extraction is implemented by using charge sharing and voltage comparison, no subtraction operation is needed. This stereo retina has been simulated with real-scene images taken from a running car on highway. The simulation results are very positive and a 128-pixel line retina has been designed and submitted to fabrication.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5064/13852/00639536.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1994.639536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1994.639536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on an analog stereo retina for automobile applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Automobiles","IIR filters","CMOS technology","Vehicle detection","Intelligent vehicles","Intelligent robots","Matched filters","Image converters","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot vision","stereo image processing","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","image sensors","automotive electronics","analogue processing circuits","object detection","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog stereo retina","automobile applications","stereovision algorithm","intelligent vehicles","autonomous robots","DoG filtered images","matching primitives","IIR 2D spatial Gaussian filter","CMOS technology","charge sharing","voltage comparison","stereo retina","real-scene images","128-pixel line retina","128 pixel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on an analog stereo retina for automobile applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917210","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on an analog stereo retina for automobile applications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00639536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02661S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"13852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5064","citationCount":"3","articleId":"639536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":639539,"authors":[{"name":"M.

V/sub DDT/ analysis takes advantage of the limited response time of a voltage supply to the changing power demand of an IC during operation. Changes in the V/sub DD/ response time can be used to detect increases in the power demand of a microcontroller with resolutions of 20 nA at 100 kHz, 1 /spl mu/A at 1 MHz, and 2.5 /spl mu/A at 1.5 MHz. These current sensitivities have been shown for ICs with very low I/sub DDQ/ (<100 nA) and for an IC with an intrinsic I/sub DDQ/>300 /spl mu/A. The present system uses 100 cycle averaging to compensate for low frequency \"jitter\". The V/sub DDT/ signal acquisition protocols, frequency versus sensitivity tradeoffs, hardware considerations, noise limitations, data examples, and areas for future research are described.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5033/13797/00639590.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1997.639590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1997.639590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient power supply voltage (V/sub DDT/) analysis for detecting IC defects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Voltage","Testing","Delay","Power demand","Frequency","Transient analysis","Microcontrollers","Protocols","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","transients","microcontrollers","power supplies to apparatus","voltage measurement","waveform analysis","delays","integrated circuit noise","fault diagnosis","automatic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC defects","transient power supply voltage","I/sub DDQ/ testing","V/sub DDT/ analysis","voltage supply","microcontroller","current sensitivities","signal acquisition protocols","sensitivity tradeoffs","hardware","noise","CMOS IC","100 kHz","1 MHz","1.5 MHz","100 nA","300 muA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transient power supply voltage (V/sub DDT/) analysis for detecting IC defects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5870064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient power supply voltage (V/sub DDT/) analysis for detecting IC defects","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108822S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"10","articleId":"639590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":639593,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Though the newest system design methodology has several advantages in terms of time-to-market and system cost, testing such core-based systems is difficult due to the problem of justifying test sequences at the inputs of a core embedded deep in the system, and propagating test responses from the core outputs. In this paper, we present a design for testability and symbolic test generation technique for testing such core-based systems on a chip. The proposed method consists of two parts: (i) core-level DFT to make each core testable and transparent, the latter needed to propagate test data through the cores, and (ii) system-level DFT and test generation to ensure the justification and propagation of the precomputed test sequences and test responses of the core. Since the hierarchical testability analysis technique used to tackle the above problem is symbolic, the system test generation method is independent of the bit-width of the cores. The system-level test set is obtained as a by-product of the testability analysis and insertion method without further search. Besides the proposed test method, the two methods that are currently used in the industry were also evaluated on two example systems: (i) FScan-BScan, where each core is full-scanned, and system test is performed using boundary scan, and (ii) FScan-TBus, where each core is full-scanned, and system test is performed using a test bus. The experiments show that the proposed scheme has significantly lower area overhead, delay overhead, and test application time compared to FScan-BScan and FScan-TBus, without any compromise in the system fault coverage.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1997.639593","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5033/13797/00639593.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1997.639593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low overhead design for testability and test generation technique for core-based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639593/","displayDocTitle":"A low overhead design for testability and test generation technique for core-based systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5870067","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low overhead design for testability and test generation technique for core-based systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030612S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"31","articleId":"639593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":639596,"authors":[{"name":"L.

An effective approach to the reduction of the download time is to compress test data before the download. A compression algorithm for test data should meet two requirements: lossless and simple decompression. In this paper we propose a new test data compression method that aims to fully utilize the unique characteristics of test data compression. The key idea of the proposed method is to perform the Burrows-Wheeler transformation on the sequence of test patterns, and then to apply run-length coding. The experimental results show that our compression method performs better than six other methods for compressing test data. The average compression ratio of the proposed method performed on five test data sets is 315, while that for the next best one, the LZW method, is 21.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method for compressing test data","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1997.639597","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5033/13797/00639597.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1997.639597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method for compressing test data","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5870070","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method for compressing test data","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037238S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"31","articleId":"639597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":639606,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Using embedded cores enables the design of high-complexity system-chips with densities as high as millions of gates on a single die. The increase in using pre-designed IP cores in system-chips adds to the complexity of test. To test system-chips adequately, test solutions need to be incorporated into individual cores and then the tests from individual cores need to be scheduled and assembled into a chip level test. However with the increased usage of cores from multiple and diverse sources, it is essential to create standard mechanisms to make core test plug-and-play possible. This paper discusses in general the challenges in testing core-based system-chips and describes their corresponding test solutions. It concentrates on the common test requirements and introduces the on-going standardization efforts, specifically under IEEE P1500 Working Group, which is meant to standardize the interface between a core test and its host the System-on-Chip.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test requirements for embedded core-based systems and IEEE P1500","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1997.639613","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5033/13797/00639613.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1997.639613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Test requirements for embedded core-based systems and IEEE P1500","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876896","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test requirements for embedded core-based systems and IEEE P1500","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046189S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"86","articleId":"639613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":639614,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Moreover, failing memory cells need to be 'characterized' before a physical failure analysis can be carried out in order to determine the root causes of likely problems. It is common practice to put small pads on the bit lines (BLs) and probe the bit-line signal with so-called pico-probes. This paper describes a new approach to measuring the cell signal using a normal test procedure without pico-probes.

However, none of these address issues such as fault detection or testability. This paper presents an algorithm which maps optimized Boolean expressions into look-up table based FPGAs. This mapping automatically incorporates testability features into designs, allowing on-line detection of faults within a FPGA. This is accomplished by utilizing a unique set of cells to implement a design. These cells operate on the premise of a two-rail checker, thus producing both the normal and complemented output when a cell is operating correctly, and two outputs of the same value in the presence of a fault. Faults generated in an intermediate cell is propagated to the final outputs, thus allowing on-line testability of a FPGA-based logic system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639653/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5870094","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On-line testable logic design for FPGA implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line testable logic design for FPGA implementation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033041S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"19","articleId":"639653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":639662,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Our approach is based on a new Built-In Self-Test (BIST) architecture for FPGAs and can accurately locate any single and most multiple faulty PLBs. An adaptive diagnostic strategy provides identification of faulty PLBs with a 7% increase in testing time over the complete detection test, and can also be used for manufacturing yield enhancement.

As the stimulus generation and output analysis circuits are digital and do not require calibration, this jitter transfer function measurement scheme is highly amenable to built-in self-test.

We focus on crosstalk due to capacitive coupling between a pair of lines. We first consider the case where crosstalk noise manifests as a pulse and characterize the maximum amplitude, width, energy and timing of this pulse. Closed form equations quantifying the dependence of these pulse attributes on the values of circuit parameters and the rise time of the input transition are derived. We also consider how crosstalk causes slowdown (speedup), i.e. increases (decreases) the rise/fall times of signals on coupled lines, when their inputs have transitions in the opposite (same) directions. Expressions relating the slowdown (speedup) to circuit parameters, the rise/fall times of the input transitions, and the skew between the transitions are derived. We show that crosstalk effects can be significantly aggravated by variations in the fabrication process. New design corners are identified for validation of designs that have significant crosstalk effects. Finally, the results of our analysis provide conditions that must be satisfied by a sequence of vectors used for validation of designs as well as post-manufacturing testing of devices in the presence of significant crosstalk.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5870103","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analytic models for crosstalk delay and pulse analysis under non-ideal inputs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic models for crosstalk delay and pulse analysis under non-ideal inputs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043308S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"92","articleId":"639695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":639699,"authors":[{"name":"Seongmoon Wang","affiliation":["E.E.Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Seongmoon Wang","id":"37280454100"},{"name":"S.K.

The proposed TPG, called dual-speed LFSR (DS-LFSR), consists of two linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), a slow LFSR and a normal-speed LFSR. The slow LFSR is driven by a slow clock whose speed is width that of the normal clock which drives the normal-speed LFSR, The use of DS-LFSR lowers the transition density at the circuit inputs driven by the slow LFSR, leading to a reduction in heat dissipation during test application. A procedure is presented to design a DS-LFSR so as to achieve high fault coverage by ensuring that patterns generated by it are unique and uniformly distributed. A new gain function, and a method to compute its value for each circuit input, is proposed to select inputs to be driven by the slow LFSR. Also, a procedure to increase the number of inputs driven by the slow LFSR by combining compatible inputs is presented to further decrease the heat dissipation, Finally, DS-LFSRs are designed for the ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and shown to provide 13% to 70% reduction in the numbers of transitions with no loss of fault coverage and at very slight area overheads.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1997.639699","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5033/13797/00639699.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1997.639699","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1997","startPage":"848","endPage":"857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS-LFSR: a new BIST TPG for low heat dissipation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=639699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"DS-LFSR: a new BIST TPG for low heat dissipation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/639699/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5870107","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS-LFSR: a new BIST TPG for low heat dissipation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00639699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05184S","chronDate":"1-6 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033","citationCount":"64","articleId":"639699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":639707,"authors":[{"name":"A.
