This paper presents a novel distributed solution by exploiting a system level perspective instead. Building on a realistic system model with impromptu RS deployments, we develop an analytical framework for tilt optimization that can dynamically maximize spectral efficiency of both the BS-RS and BS-user links in an online manner. To obtain a distributed self-organizing solution, the large scale system-wide optimization problem is decomposed into local small scale subproblems by applying the design principles of self-organization in biological systems. The local subproblems are non-convex, but having a very small scale, can be solved via standard nonlinear optimization techniques such as sequential quadratic programming. The performance of the developed solution is evaluated through extensive simulations for an LTE-A type system and compared against a number of benchmarks including a centralized solution obtained via brute force, that also gives an upper bound to assess the optimality gap. Results show that the proposed solution can enhance average spectral efficiency by up to 50% compared to fixed tilting, with negligible signaling overheads. The key advantage of the proposed solution is its potential for autonomous and distributed implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.011614.130299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.011614.130299","startPage":"764","endPage":"779","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06750010.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self Organization of Tilts in Relay Enhanced Networks: A Distributed Solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Self Organization of Tilts in Relay Enhanced Networks: A Distributed Solution","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750010/","accessionNumber":"14131458","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750010/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self Organization of Tilts in Relay Enhanced Networks: A Distributed Solution","sourcePdf":"0764-tw1402-imran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087711S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6750010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6750019,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Rueda","affiliation":["Computer Imaging and Medical Applications Laboratory\u2014CIM@LAB, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Rueda","id":"37978315500"},{"name":"Fabio A.

Moreover, automatic brain morphometric analyses, that do perform this quantification, contribute very little to the comprehension of the disease, i.e., many of these methods classify but they do not produce useful anatomo-functional correlations. This paper presents a new fully automatic image analysis method that reveals discriminative brain patterns associated to the presence of neurodegenerative diseases, mining systematic differences and therefore grading objectively any neurological disorder. This is accomplished by a fusion strategy that mixes together bottom-up and top-down information flows. Bottom-up information comes from a multiscale analysis of different image features, while the top-down stage includes learning and fusion strategies formulated as a max-margin multiple-kernel optimization problem. The capacity of finding discriminative anatomic patterns was evaluated using the Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the use case. The classification performance was assessed under different configurations of the proposed approach in two public brain magnetic resonance datasets (OASIS-MIRIAD) with patients diagnosed with AD, showing an improvement varying from 6.2% to 13% in the equal error rate measure, with respect to what has been reported by the feature-based morphometry strategy. In terms of the anatomical analysis, discriminant regions found by the proposed approach highly correlates to what has been reported in clinical studies of AD.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2308999","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6823194/06750019.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2308999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Salient Brain Patterns for Imaging-Based Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Salient Brain Patterns for Imaging-Based Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14365864","pubMedId":"24893256","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750019/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Salient Brain Patterns for Imaging-Based Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases","sourcePdf":"tmi-romero-2308999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120139S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6823194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6823194","articleId":"6750019","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6750021,"authors":[{"name":"Toshihiro Hori","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, Ibaraki National College of Technology, Hitachinaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Hori","id":"38125043000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6750021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Harmonic analysis","Sampling methods","Nonlinear circuits","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-dimensional sampling method","two-dimensional diamond-shaped discrete frequency distribution","1D sampling method","2D diamond-shaped discrete frequency distribution","harmonic balance method","2D discrete frequency plane","diamond-shaped rhombic tiles","sampling point","frequency component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit analysis","data compression","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","multidimensional system","sampling methods"]},{"kwd":["Circuit analysis","data compression","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","multidimensional system","sampling methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750021","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2304877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2304877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6798683/06750021.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel One-Dimensional Sampling Method to Calculate Two-Dimensional Diamond-Shaped Discrete Frequency Distributions","abstract":"A novel 1-D sampling method is proposed to calculate 2-D diamond-shaped discrete frequency distributions, which are often treated in the harmonic balance method.

It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is regulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and inertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting for 98 \u00b11.2% of the variance. When averaged across subjects, the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm/rad/kg between 20% and 70% of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statistically greater than zero only for the estimate at 70% of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms/rad/kg. The slope of the ankle's torque-angle curve-known as the quasi-stiffness-was not statistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the specifications for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2307256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/6848867/06750034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2307256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6848867","startPage":"870","endPage":"878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Human Ankle Impedance During the Stance Phase of Walking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Human Ankle Impedance During the Stance Phase of Walking","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429410","pubMedId":"24760937","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750034/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Human Ankle Impedance During the Stance Phase of Walking","sourcePdf":"tnsre-rouse-2307256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094543S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6848867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6848867","articleId":"6750034","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6750035,"authors":[{"name":"Mau-Tsuen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Dong-Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/6847757/6750035/6750035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mau-Tsuen Yang received the PhD degree in computer science and engineering from the Pennsylvania State University, in 2000.

First of all, we apply automatic video segmentation and key-frame detection to offer a visual guideline for the video content navigation. Subsequently, we extract textual metadata by applying video Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology on key-frames and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on lecture audio tracks. The OCR and ASR transcript as well as detected slide text line types are adopted for keyword extraction, by which both video- and segment-level keywords are extracted for content-based video browsing and search.

A new technique based on complex Laplacian is introduced to address the problems of which formation shapes specified by inter-agent relative positions can be formed and how they can be achieved with distributed control ensuring global stability. Concerning the first question, we show that all similar formations subject to only shape constraints are those that lie in the null space of a complex Laplacian satisfying certain rank condition and that a formation shape can be realized almost surely if and only if the graph modeling the inter-agent specification of the formation shape is 2-rooted. Concerning the second question, a distributed and linear control law is developed based on the complex Laplacian specifying the target formation shape, and provable existence conditions of stabilizing gains to assign the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system at desired locations are given. Moreover, we show how the formation shape control law is extended to achieve a rigid formation if a subset of knowledgable agents knowing the desired formation size scales the formation while the rest agents do not need to re-design and change their control laws.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2309031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6840376/06750042.pdf","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2309031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems Using Complex Laplacian","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750042/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems Using Complex Laplacian","volume":"59","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14397176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750042/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273113"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems Using Complex Laplacian","sourcePdf":"tac-lin-2309031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098656S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6840376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"6840376","articleId":"6750042","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6750043,"authors":[{"name":"Arindam Sanyal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Sanyal","id":"38552853100"},{"name":"Nan Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37590237800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6750043","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2208},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Capacitance","Capacitors","Solid state circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","low-power electronics","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient switching scheme","low frequency-dependence switching technique","successive approximation register ADC","SAR analog-to-digital converters","switching energy","SAR ADC","SPICE simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","digital-to-analog converter (DAC)","successive approximation register (SAR)","switching energy"]},{"kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","digital-to-analog converter (DAC)","successive approximation register (SAR)","switching energy"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a highly energy-efficient switching scheme for successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters that achieves a 95% reduction in switching energy over the conventional SAR.

In particular, we show that qd(M, N) DoF are achievable for the three-user qMT \u00d7 qMR MIMO interference channel, for some positive integer q, which may be seen as a spatial extension factor. q is the scaling factor needed to make the value qd(M, N) an integer. Given spatial extensions, the achievability relies only on linear beamforming based interference alignment schemes and requires neither channel extensions nor channel variations in time or frequency. In the absence of spatial extensions, it is shown through examples how essentially the same interference alignment scheme may be applied over time-extensions over either constant or time-varying channels. The central new insight to emerge from this paper is the notion of subspace alignment chains as the DoF bottlenecks. The subspace alignment chains are instrumental both in identifying the extra dimensions to be provided by a genie to a receiver for the DoF outer bound, as well as in the construction of the optimal interference alignment schemes. The DoF value d(M, N) is a piecewise linear function of M, N, with either M or N being the bottleneck within each linear segment, whereas the other value contains some redundancy, i.e., it can be reduced without reducing the DoF. The corner points of these piecewise linear segments correspond to two sets, A={1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...}and B={1/3, 3/5, 5/7, ...}. The set A contains all those values of M/N and only those values of M/N for which there is redundancy in both M and N, i.e., either can be reduced without reducing the DoF. The set B contains all those values of M/N and only those values of M/N for which there is no redundancy in either M or N, i.e., neither can be reduced without reducing the DoF. Because A and B represent settings with maximum and minimum redundancy, essentially they are the basis for the DoF outer bounds and inner bounds, respectively. Our results settle the question of feasibility of linear interference alignment, introduced previously by Cenk et al., for the three-user M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n \u00d7 M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n MIMO interference channel, completely for all values of M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n, M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n.

With the exception of the values M/N \u2208 B, and only with that exception, we show that for every M/N value there are proper systems (as defined by Cenk et al.) that are not feasible. Evidently the redundancy contained in all other values of M/N manifests itself as superfluous variables that are not discounted in the definition of proper systems, thus creating a discrepancy between proper and feasible systems. Our results show that M/N \u2208 A are the only values for which there is no DoF benefit of joint processing among co-located antennas at the transmitters or receivers. This may also be seen as a consequence of the maximum redundancy in the M/N \u2208 A settings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06750060.pdf","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2308988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2308988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace Alignment Chains and the Degrees of Freedom of the Three-User MIMO Interference Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","MIMO","Time-frequency analysis","Receiving antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","time-varying channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitters","receivers","colocated antennas","DoF inner bounds","maximum redundancy","minimum redundancy","piecewise linear segments","corner points","piecewise linear function","time-varying channels","channel extensions","channel variations","linear beamforming based interference alignment schemes","spatial extension factor","DoF outer bound","time dimensions","frequency dimensions","space dimensions","multiple-input multiple-output interference channel","three-user MIMO interference channel","degrees of freedom","subspace alignment chains"]},{"kwd":["MIMO interference channel","interference alignment","subspace alignment chains","degrees of freedom"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Subspace Alignment Chains and the Degrees of Freedom of the Three-User MIMO Interference Channel","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6750060/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14251121","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace Alignment Chains and the Degrees of Freedom of the Three-User MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2308988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22648S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6750060","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750061,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Dashtestani","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6917239/6750061/6750061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Dashtestani received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Shiraz, Shiraz, Iran, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.","He has worked for semiconductor industries and the leaders of Analog Integrated Circuits design such as Burr\u2013Brown and Texas Instruments, and currently a Senior Analog IC Designer, Lead at NXP Semiconductors, Tempe.

Sliding-mode control provides several benefits over the traditional PID control in terms of fast transient response, robustness to parameter and component variations, and low sensitivity to loop disturbances. However, analog implementations of sliding-mode control require several amplifiers in the controller and suffer from process, voltage, and temperature variations. In the proposed approach, the sliding-mode controller (SMC) is implemented digitally; utilizing a first order single-bit \u03a3\u0394 frequency to digital converter (\u03a3\u0394FDC)-based feedback and reference digitizing ADCs, running at 32-MHz sampling rate. The ADSM regulator achieves 1% settling time in less than 5 \u03bcs for a load variation of 600 mA. The SMC uses a high-bandwidth hysteretic differentiator and an integrator to perform the sliding control law in digital domain.

It is known that the standard LRR can only work well under the assumption that all the subspaces are independent. However, this assumption cannot be guaranteed in real-world problems. This paper addresses this problem and provides an extension of LRR, named structure-constrained LRR (SC-LRR), to analyze the structure of multiple disjoint subspaces, which is more general for real vision data. We prove that the relationship of multiple linear disjoint subspaces can be exactly revealed by SC-LRR, with a predefined weight matrix. As a nontrivial byproduct, we also illustrate that SC-LRR can be applied for semisupervised learning. The experimental results on different types of vision problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semisupervised learning","Educational institutions","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Data models","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image motion analysis","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structure-constrained low-rank representation","subspace segmentation","computer vision","pattern recognition","motion segmentation","image segmentation","saliency detection","semisupervised learning","structure-constrained LRR","multiple linear disjoint subspaces","weight matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disjoint subspaces","low-rank representation (LRR)","semisupervised learning","subspace segmentation."]},{"kwd":["Disjoint subspaces","low-rank representation (LRR)","semisupervised learning","subspace segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6960135/06750063.pdf","startPage":"2167","endPage":"2179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure-Constrained Low-Rank Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Structure-Constrained Low-Rank Representation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750063/","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750063/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14759097","pubMedId":"25420240","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61300086"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M530917"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT12RC(3)67"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China","grantNumber":"A1404"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173103, 91230103 and U0935004"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX04005021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure-Constrained Low-Rank Representation","sourcePdf":"tnnls-tang-2306063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203384S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6750063","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":6750072,"authors":[{"name":"Steve B.

First, the considered nonlinear systems are described by multiple T-S fuzzy models with uncertain grades of membership and local nonlinear parts in normal case and faulty cases. Then, a switching technique is introduced to address the uncertain grades of membership, external disturbances, local nonlinear parts, faults, and the coupling of them. In a multiple-model scheme, a bank of FDI observers are constructed, each of which is based on the T-S model that describes the system in the presence of a particular fault, such that one of them can track the current system state, and the corresponding observer estimate error can converge exponentially to zero. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the new results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation for a Class of Uncertain State-Feedback Fuzzy Control Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2308920","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7027905/06750075.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2308920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation for a Class of Uncertain State-Feedback Fuzzy Control Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6750075/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915103","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Isolation for a Class of Uncertain State-Feedback Fuzzy Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-yang-2308920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052261S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","isNumber":"7027905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"94","articleId":"6750075","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750082,"authors":[{"name":"Arpine Soghoyan","affiliation":["University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6851964/6750082/sogho-2304352-small.gif","p":["Arpine Soghoyan received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in radiophysics and electronics from Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia, and the M.Sc. degree in computer and information science from the American University of Armenia, Yerevan.

Recently, software defined radio (SDR) approach for GPS receivers (GPS-SDR) gained attention because of its flexibility for multimode operations in different environments. The SDR receiver developers continually advance algorithmic and/or hardware accelerator solutions. However, they need fast prototyping and testing instrumentation to refine and evaluate high performance multimode receivers. This paper presents a feasibility study of fast prototyping of the GPS receiver accelerators using graphical user interface environments. It also describes a testbed with integrated RF front-ends, GPS simulator, receiver, and assistance support. Particularly, a novel host-target codesign solution is demonstrated using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) peripheral and LabVIEW FPGA tool for a case study of a GPS acquisition module. Distributing tasks between the FPGA target and the personal computer host achieves a high performance solution. The fast prototyped solution is compared with a conventional FPGA and state-of-the-art implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Development and Testing Instrumentation for GPS Software Defined Radio With Fast FPGA Prototyping Support","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2304352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6851964/06750082.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2304352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6851964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Development and Testing Instrumentation for GPS Software Defined Radio With Fast FPGA Prototyping Support","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6750082/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14432028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"0942852 and 0932339"},{"fundingName":"UTSA-NEEC Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Development and Testing Instrumentation for GPS Software Defined Radio With Fast FPGA Prototyping Support","sourcePdf":"tim-soghoyan-2304352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112854S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6851964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6851964","articleId":"6750082","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750093,"authors":[{"name":"Sreechakra Goparaju","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sreechakra Goparaju is a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, where he joined as a Gordon Wu Fellow in 2008.

In particular, an (n, k) maximum distance separable (MDS) code stores k symbols in n disks such that the overall system is tolerant to a failure of up to n - k disks. However, access to at least k disks is still required to repair a single erasure. To reduce repair bandwidth, array codes are used where the stored symbols or packets are vectors of length \u2113. The MDS array codes have the potential to repair a single erasure using a fraction 1/(n - k) of data stored in the remaining disks. We introduce new methods of analysis, which capitalize on the translation of the storage system problem into a geometric problem on a set of operators and subspaces. In particular, we ask the following question: for a given (n, k), what is the minimum vector-length or subpacketization factor \u2113 required to achieve this optimal fraction? For exact recovery of systematic disks in an MDS code of low redundancy, i.e., k/n > 1/2, the best known explicit codes have a subpacketization factor \u2113, which is exponential in k. It has been conjectured that for a fixed number of parity nodes, it is in fact necessary for \u2113 to be exponential in k. In this paper, we provide a new log-squared converse bound on k for a given \u2113, and prove that k \u2264 2 log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n I(log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b4</sub>\n \u2113 + 1), for an arbitrary number of parity nodes r = n - k, where \u03b4 = r/(r - 1).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750093/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239015","volume":"60","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Sub-Packetization Bound for Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Sub-Packetization Bound for Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-goparaju-2309000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110994S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6750093","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6750095,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/6810798/6750095/6750095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen (S\u201906\u2013M\u201911) received the Bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004, the M.Phil. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2011.","His current research interests include data science, network science, game theory, social learning and networking, as well as signal processing and wireless communications.","Dr. Chen is the recipient of multiple honors and awards including best paper award from IEEE GLOBECOM, in 2013, Future Faculty Fellowship and Distinguished Dissertation Fellowship Honorable Mention from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in 2010 and 2011, respectively, Finalist of Deans Doctoral Research Award from A.

It is shown that the TR technique is a promising technique that focuses signal waves in both time and space domains. The unique asymmetric architecture significantly reduces the cost of the terminal devices, the total number of which is expected to be very large for IoT. The focusing effect of the TR technique can harvest the energy of all the multi-paths at the receiver, which improves the energy efficiency of the wireless transmission and thus the battery life of terminal devices in IoT. Facilitated by the high-resolution spatial focusing, the TR division multiple access scheme leverages the uniqueness of the multi-path profiles in the rich-scattering environment and maps them into location-specific signatures, so that spatial multiplexing can be achieved for multiple users operating on the same spectrum. In addition, the TR system can easily support heterogeneous terminal devices by providing various quality-of-service (QoS) options through adjusting the waveform and rate backoff factor. Finally, the unique location-specific signature in TR system can provide additional physical-layer security and thus can enhance the privacy and security of customers in IoT. All the advantages show that the TR technique is a promising paradigm for IoT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14282879","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750095/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Reversal Wireless Paradigm for Green Internet of Things: An Overview","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Reversal Wireless Paradigm for Green Internet of Things: An Overview","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2308838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179057S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6810798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6810798","articleId":"6750095","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6750097,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37674351600"},{"name":"Ping Gui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Gui","id":"37265688100"},{"name":"Rick Jordanger","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rick","lastName":"Jordanger","id":"37086628982"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6750097","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Transmitters","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Resistors","Harmonic analysis","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","distortion","feedback amplifiers","field programmable gate arrays","power amplifiers","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated high-voltage linear power amplifier","medical ultrasonic transmitter applications","current-feedback technique","cascading push-pull class-AB buffers","gain-bandwidth product limitation","voltage-feedback amplifier","closed-loop bandwidth","dynamic current biasing topology","voltage-controlled current source","7-bit digital-to-analog converter","DAC","digital predistortion technique","DPD technique","analog-to-digital converter","digital field-programmable gate array","medical ultrasound image quality","word length 7 bit","size 1 mum","voltage 200 V","resistance 100 ohm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current-feedback amplifier (CFA)","digital predistortion (DPD)","high-voltage (HV) power amplifier","ultrasound transmitter"]},{"kwd":["Current-feedback amplifier (CFA)","digital predistortion (DPD)","high-voltage (HV) power amplifier","ultrasound transmitter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750097","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2305213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2305213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6832670/06750097.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated High-Voltage Low-Distortion Current-Feedback Linear Power Amplifier for Ultrasound Transmitters Using Digital Predistortion and Dynamic Current Biasing Techniques","abstract":"A novel integrated high-voltage linear power amplifier for medical ultrasonic transmitter applications is presented in this brief. The amplifier employs a current-feedback technique with two cascading push-pull class-AB buffers. It overcomes the gain-bandwidth product limitation of a conventional voltage-feedback amplifier, capable of generating high output signal swing with a wide closed-loop bandwidth. In addition, a dynamic current biasing topology is integrated on-chip using a voltage-controlled current source and a 7-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). To further improve the signal linearity of the amplifier output, a digital predistortion (DPD) technique is applied by using a DAC, an analog-to-digital converter, and a digital field-programmable gate array. The presented amplifier was fabricated using a 1-\u03bcm 200-V CMOS process. The measurement results show that this integrated linear power amplifier is capable of driving a load of a 100-\u03a9 resistor in parallel with a 300-pF capacitor while achieving a signal swing up to 180 V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pp</sub>\n with a second-order harmonic distortion as low as -50 dB. Measurement results also show that the amplifier achieves a maximum slew rate of 4 V/ns and a power efficiency of 30%.

According to the generating mechanism, the total valve losses of the MMC are divided into three parts: 1) conduction losses; 2) essential switching losses; and 3) additional switching losses. Due to the large number of arm submodules in MMC-HVDC links, the harmonic components in the arm voltages and currents are omitted. Therefore, the conduction losses and the essential switching losses can be precisely represented by analytical formulas. The additional switching losses are described by an analytical upper limit. The case studies are performed on a 400-MW \u00b1200-kV MMC-HVDC system under 12 typical operating conditions. Both the relative errors of the conduction losses and the essential switching losses between the analytical and the simulated results are within \u00b14%. The analytical upper limits cover almost all of the simulated results for additional switching losses. Finally, an acceptable number for the analytical method is described based on the simulation results, which proves the effectiveness of this method and clarifies the potential to take advantage of this method in engineering applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2304724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2304724","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6819482/06750107.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Valve Losses Evaluation Based on Piecewise Analytical Method for MMC\u2013HVDC Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Valve Losses Evaluation Based on Piecewise Analytical Method for MMC\u2013HVDC Links","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750107/","accessionNumber":"14318896","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750107/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Valve Losses Evaluation Based on Piecewise Analytical Method for MMC\u2013HVDC Links","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-xu-2304724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079818S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6819482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6819482","articleId":"6750107","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6750119,"authors":[{"name":"Kuldip K.

In traditional SAA radar, the receiving antenna array elements are successively switched according to their natural spatial order [referred to as sequential SAAs (SSAAs)]. For radars using both SSAA and FMCW methods, the phase difference caused by the target azimuth and time delay will be difficult to distinguish, thus resulting in delay-space coupling, which may lead to degradation of the road target observation. In this paper, randomized SAA (RSAA) FMCW radar is proposed. The new radar scheme has high delay/space resolution for target location detection and character extraction, and can also solve the coupling problem. The signal model of RSAA FMCW radar is derived and compared with that of SSAA radar. The influence of the antenna-array switching mode on the radar performance is also analyzed. A conventional zero-padding algorithm and a new clustering FOCUSS algorithm are both introduced for the signal processing of the new radar scheme. The numerical results illustrate the performance of RSAA FMCW radar in high-resolution target imaging and delay-space decoupling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06750120.pdf","startPage":"3624","endPage":"3641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2308895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2308895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Switched Antenna Array FMCW Radar for Automotive Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Radar","Switches","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","CW radar","FM radar","radar antennas","radar detection","radar resolution","receiving antennas","road vehicle radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized switched antenna array FMCW radar","frequency-modulated continuous-wave method","automotive radar","receiving antenna array elements","low hardware complexity","sequential SAAs","SSAAs","natural spatial order","target azimuth","delay-space coupling problem","road target observation degradation","RSAA FMCW radar","target location detection","high delay-space resolution","character extraction","signal model","zero-padding algorithm","clustering FOCUSS algorithm","signal processing","high-resolution target imaging"]},{"kwd":["Automotive radar","clustering FOCUSS","frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW)","randomized switched antenna array (RSAA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Switched Antenna Array FMCW Radar for Automotive Applications","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6750120/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665055","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201356"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2010CB731901"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP0100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Switched Antenna Array FMCW Radar for Automotive Applications","sourcePdf":"tvt-hu-2308895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101154S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6750120","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750125,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad S.

Due to process variations of advanced CMOS technologies, it becomes both challenging and costly to maintain perfectly functioning memories under all anticipated operating conditions. Thus, Voltage over Scaling (VoS) has emerged as a means to achieve energy efficient systems resulting in a tradeoff between energy efficiency and reliability. In this paper we present the algorithm and VLSI architecture of a novel error-resilient K-Best MIMO detector based on the combined distribution of channel noise and induced errors due to VoS. The simulation results show that, compared with a conventional MIMO detector design, the proposed algorithm provides up-to 4.5 dB gain to achieve the near-optimal Packet Error Rate (PER) performance in the 4 \u00d7 4 64-QAM system. Furthermore, based on experimental results, when jointly considering the detector and memory power consumption, the proposed resilient scheme with VoS memory can achieve up to 32.64% savings compared to the conventional K-Best detector with perfect memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms and Architectures of Energy-Efficient Error-Resilient MIMO Detectors for Memory-Dominated Wireless Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2298273","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6842725/06750125.pdf","startPage":"2159","endPage":"2171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2298273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms and Architectures of Energy-Efficient Error-Resilient MIMO Detectors for Memory-Dominated Wireless Communication Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6750125/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14397477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0955157"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms and Architectures of Energy-Efficient Error-Resilient MIMO Detectors for Memory-Dominated Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsi-khairy-2298273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102401S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6842725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6842725","articleId":"6750125","onlineDate":"27 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750134,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The increasing design complexity of lab-on-a-chips necessitates the computer-aided design (CAD) methodology in contrast to the classical manual design methodology. A key part in lab-on-a-chip CAD is physical-level synthesis. It includes the lab-on-a-chip placement and routing, where placement is to determine the physical location and the starting time of each operation and routing is to transport each droplet from the source to the destination. In the lab-on-a-chip design, variation, contamination, and defect need to be considered. This work designs a physical-level synthesis flow which simultaneously considers variation, contamination, and defect of the lab-on-a-chip design. It proposes a maze routing based, variation, contamination, and defect aware droplet routing technique, which is seamlessly integrated into an existing placement technique. The proposed technique improves the placement solution for routing and achieves the placement and routing co-optimization to handle variation, contamination, and defect. The simulation results demonstrate that our technique does not use any defective/contaminated grids, while the technique without considering contamination and defect uses 17.0% of the defective/contaminated grids on average. In addition, our routing variation aware technique significantly improves the average routing yield by 51.2% with only 3.5% increase in completion time compared to a routing variation unaware technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/6750079/06750135.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2013.2294943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2013.2294943","startPage":"3","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-Level Synthesis for Digital Lab-On-a-Chip Considering Variation, Contamination, and Defect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750135/","displayDocTitle":"Physical-Level Synthesis for Digital Lab-On-a-Chip Considering Variation, Contamination, and Defect","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750135/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14131471","pubMedId":"24594509","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical-Level Synthesis for Digital Lab-On-a-Chip Considering Variation, Contamination, and Defect","sourcePdf":"tnb-liao-2294943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081182S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"6750079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6750079","articleId":"6750135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6750166,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Aydin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Aydin","id":"37085715279"},{"name":"Jeremy Jacob","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37276398500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-20-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6750166","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machine monitors","Privacy","Government","Cloud computing","Security","Digital forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","data acquisition","data recording","digital forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","forensics development","cloud forensics","Big Data issues","data recording","data acquisition","data storage"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has become an increasingly important resource in recent years, with the provision of easy to use on demand resources attracting many users.

We provide a comparison between how the designs will perform with regard to these issues, and look at how the competing demands of stakeholders on these issues will require a balance in order for the development of cloud forensics.","doi":"10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750166","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745432/6750143/06750166.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750143","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of major issues for the development of forensics in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of major issues for the development of forensics in cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750166/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14416389","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750166/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of major issues for the development of forensics in cloud computing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"W3BDSN12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070769S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745432","isNumber":"6750143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745432","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6750143","articleId":"6750166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Infonomics Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6750215,"authors":[{"name":"Aneel Rahim","affiliation":["Telecommunications Software & Systems Group, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"firstName":"Aneel","lastName":"Rahim","id":"37086740320"},{"name":"Paul Malone","affiliation":["Telecommunications Software & Systems Group, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Malone","id":"37699143700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-20-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6750215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750215","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanobioscience","Intrusion detection","Electromagnetics","Nanoscale devices","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanotechnology","security of data","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel intrusion detection system","wireless nano sensor networks","nano machines","WNSN","Malicious nodes","malicious data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nanotechnology","nano communications","nano networks","Intrusion Detection System","privacy"]}],"abstract":"Nano communication is an emerging multi-disciplinary research field of global importance. Nano machines are small in size and connected with each other to share information and perform small tasks such as simple computing, sensing, etc. Applications include healthcare, smart buildings, military and industrial products. The main theme of this proposed research study is the security of nano communications. Very limited research material currently exists in the area of security in nano networks. While security is an important concern in today's digital and physical world, sufficient research is not present in the network architecture of Wireless Nano sensor Networks (WNSNs). There is no intrusion detection system in existence for nano communication. Malicious nodes and malicious data provide a threat to nano networks in similar ways as they occur in traditional networks, but the limited communications facilities provide different challenges. The proposed work will bridge this current gap and provide a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for nano communications, which will detect malicious nodes and malicious data. Through a literature research, requirement elicitation, framework and algorithm design, we will develop the proposed solution for securing nano networks.","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745432/6750143/06750215.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"330","doi":"10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion detection system for Wireless Nano sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion detection system for Wireless Nano sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/6750215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14416428","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion detection system for Wireless Nano sensor Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"S6IS4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071008S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745432","isNumber":"6750143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745432","xplore-issue":"6750143","articleId":"6750215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Infonomics Society","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6750223,"authors":[{"name":"Huda Elmogazy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King AbdelAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Huda","lastName":"Elmogazy","id":"37086664001"},{"name":"Omaima Bamasak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King AbdelAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Omaima","lastName":"Bamasak","id":"37410441400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-20-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6750223","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":602},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Communities","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","data protection","health care","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["healthcare data security","cloud computing","user authorisation","access traceability","healthcare cloud provider","patient data protection","cloud homomorphic encryption","splitting key","key delegation","healthcare regulatory requirement","FHE algorithm","data confidentiality","data authentication","data integrity","data availability","multilevel hierarchical order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cryptography","Threats","Homomorphic encryption"]}],"abstract":"Healthcare data has stringent security requirements for confidentiality, availability to authorized users, and traceability of access.

Virtualization which are the engine that drives cloud computing turns the data center into self-managing, highly scalable, highly available and pools of easily consumable resources. The increase in virtualization and usage of virtual machines (VM) in cloud computing environment has attracted a lot of attention from the computer security research community on the potential treats that could occurs from vast use of virtual machines in cloud computing. In this paper, methods for detecting VM using remote IP and ICMP packet timestamp detection methods and the timestamp behavior are studied, tested and investigated to determine either the problem still exist in high performance cloud computing infrastructure. The results from this study shows that there were distinguishable differences in the timestamp replies behaviors received from VM and nonVM machines even in a high performance private cloud computing environment. These results prove a significant potential that timestamp detection method could be exploited by malware as a VM detection method even in high performance cloud computing infrastructure. From the finding of this study, we proposed theory for the stand-alone environment to reply timestamp in such differences similar to the VM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750225","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745432/6750143/06750225.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"380","doi":"10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual machine remote detection method using network timestamp in cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Virtual machine remote detection method using network timestamp in cloud computing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6750225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14416436","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual machine remote detection method using network timestamp in cloud computing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"S8CS4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033373S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745432","isNumber":"6750143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745432","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6750143","articleId":"6750225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Infonomics Society","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6750258,"authors":[{"name":"Omer K.

A possible approach to protect cloud systems from natural disasters corresponds to the utilization of redundant data centers located far enough apart. The time to migrate a virtual machine (VM) from a data center to another increases due to distance. As this time impacts the overall system behavior, performability evaluation considering VM migration time and different load balances is of utmost importance when considering the analysis of distributed cloud systems. This work presents performability models for evaluating distributed cloud computing systems deployed into multiple data centers considering disaster occurrence.

In this paper, design techniques of low pass FIR filters using Tukey window, Kaiser Window, and Gaussian window methods are presented. The magnitude and phase responses are demonstrated in the simulation section for the different design techniques of digital low pass FIR filters.

As an alternative for laboratory experiments it is popularly also known as `Lab-on-a-Chip'. Reduction in pin count and avoiding cross contamination are some of the important design issues for realistic relevance. These days, due to urgent situation and cost efficacy, more than one assay operations are essential to be carried out at the same time. So, parallelism is inevitable in DMFB. Having an area of a given chip as a constraint, how efficiently we can use a limited sized chip and how much parallelism can be incorporated are the objectives of this paper. The paper presents a design automation flow that enhances parallelism by adopting Connect-5 structure of pin configuration and considering cross contamination problem as well. The algorithm developed in this paper assumes array based partitioning of modules as pin constrained design technique, where a constant number of pins has been used for desired scheduling of reagent and sample droplets. To avoid cross contamination and at the same time to minimize the delay required for washing, wash droplet scheduling and proper placement of modules to minimize wash operations are also taken care of.","doi":"10.1109/ICAEE.2013.6750308","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering (ICAEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering (ICAEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739896/6750292/06750308.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAEE.2013.6750308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A connect-5 structure based parallel assay operations in a restricted sized chip in digital microfluidics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750308/","displayDocTitle":"A connect-5 structure based parallel assay operations in a restricted sized chip in digital microfluidics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14131918","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750308/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A connect-5 structure based parallel assay operations in a restricted sized chip in digital microfluidics","confLoc":"Dkaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence015ID90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05861S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739896","isNumber":"6750292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6750292","articleId":"6750308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6750325,"authors":[{"name":"Indranil Hatai","affiliation":["E&ECE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Indranil","lastName":"Hatai","id":"37394734900"},{"name":"Indrajit Chakrabarti","affiliation":["E&ECE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Indrajit","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37268712300"},{"name":"Swapna Banerjee","affiliation":["E&ECE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Swapna","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276973900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2465-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2463-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2464-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6750325","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a fetal heart rate measuring system","abstract":"Labor during pregnancy is an inherently dangerous life event for a live fetus and its mother.

Cognitive radio practices an open spectrum allocation technique to make efficient utilization of the wireless radio spectrum and reduces the bottleneck on the frequency bands. A robust architecture with suitable communication protocol is a precondition in the deployment of cognitive radio networks. A novel cluster-based architecture for an ad-hoc cognitive radio network is proposed in this paper, where the spatial variations of spectrum opportunities are considered for clustering. Our cluster formation is defined as a maximum edge biclique problem. Each cluster consists with a set of free common channels, which benefits smooth shift between control channels. A set of cognitive radio nodes are grouped into the same cluster if they sense similar free channels and are within the communication range of the leader node called cluster head. The selection of cluster head is based on a parameter called Cluster Head Determination Factor (CHDF). Considering the re-clustering issue for mobile nodes, we also introduce the concept of secondary cluster-head. The secondary cluster-head takes charge of a cluster whenever a cluster-head moves out from the cluster. Proposed clusters adapt themselves dynamically with respect to spectrum availability, and the high mobility of the nodes. Finally, we simulate the proposed architecture to evaluate the performance of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750329/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14131883","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750329/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum aware cluster-based architecture for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum aware cluster-based architecture for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Dkaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Sequence036ID133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087633S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739896","isNumber":"6750292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739896","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6750292","articleId":"6750329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6750345,"authors":[{"name":"Farhana Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, American International University-Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Farhana","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37086690331"},{"name":"Zeenat Afroze","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, American International University-Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Zeenat","lastName":"Afroze","id":"37088153476"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2465-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2463-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2464-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6750345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"abstract":"Free Space Optics (FSO) Technology is the advanced wireless communication system that provides higher bandwidth with a higher data rate transmission over higher link range.

The goal of most social games is to entertain the player through the interaction among the players and the non-player characters (NPCs) within their friends or mutual friends. Thus, it is required to develop suitable NPCs that are fun to play against and the area of computational intelligence offers us a variety of techniques to do so. Since its beginning, game playing was a field of research in Artificial Intelligence (Al). In games, Artificial Intelligence (Al) is used to produce the illusion of intelligence in the behavior of NPCs. In the Pac-Man game, the NPCs are the ghosts. This paper illustrates a research design of MS. Pac-Man game by implementing neural networks in the movements of ghosts. Each ghost is given an unique intelligent method for movement to establish the levels of challenges in the Pac-Man game and making the game more interesting and fun to play. In addition, performance of the apps and Application Programming Interface (API) have been examined in facebook platform to check its compatibility and user friendliness.","doi":"10.1109/ICAEE.2013.6750362","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering (ICAEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739896/6750292/06750362.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering (ICAEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAEE.2013.6750362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing artificially intelligent ghosts to play MS.

Our finger tip changes its direction during the writing of numeric characters. This variation in angular movements is used to construct the dataset for the recognition system. This angular variation is used as the input of Multilayer Neural Network training and its validity was tested for a number of objects.

Firstly, the coverage optimization problem is solved analytically for the first coverage model that focuses on noise-limited communication by ignoring interference and random fading effects. This model provides useful insights into the significance of bounded path loss models to obtain meaningful solutions for this problem. The other two coverage models are based on the users' received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (\\sinr) from their associated BSs. For these models, it is shown that the coverage optimization problem can be reduced to a constrained single dimensional optimization problem without any loss of optimality. The related solutions can be obtained with limited computational complexity by resorting to a numerical search over a compact subset of candidate values. Bounds on the optimum BS density are also provided to further truncate the search space. All results are derived for general bounded path loss models. Specific applications are also illustrated to provide further design insights and to highlight the importance of using bounded path loss models for coverage analysis\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">.</sub>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","volume":"62","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14251282","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750413/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Optimal Downlink Coverage in Poisson Cellular Networks with Power Density Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Optimal Downlink Coverage in Poisson Cellular Networks with Power Density Constraints","sourcePdf":"1382-tc1404-tharaka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086385S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750413","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6750415,"authors":[{"name":"Adao Silva","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750415/6750415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ad\u00e3o Silva received the M.

On the other hand, iterative frequency-domain detection receivers based on the IB-DFE concept (Iterative Block Decision Feedback Equalization) can efficiently exploit the inherent space-frequency diversity of the MIMO MC-CDMA systems. In this paper we combine iterative IA precoding at the transmitter with IB-DFE based processing at the receiver for MC-CDMA systems. The receiver is designed in two steps: first a linear filter is used to mitigate the inter-user aligned interference, and then an iterative frequency-domain receiver is designed to efficiently separate the spatial streams in the presence of residual inter-user aligned interference at the output of the filter. The matrices for this non-linear space-frequency equalizer are obtained by minimizing the overall mean square error (MSE) of all data streams at each subcarrier. Our receiver structure is explicitly designed taking into account the residual inter-user interference, allowing both an efficient separation of the spatial streams and a reduction in the number of iterations of the IA procedure. We also propose a simple, yet accurate analytical approach for obtaining the performance of the proposed receiver structure. Our scheme achieves the maximum degrees of freedom provided by the IA precoding, while allowing an almost optimum space-diversity gain, with performance close to the matched filter bound (MFB).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022514.130681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750415.pdf","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022514.130681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection for IA-Precoded MC-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750415/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection for IA-Precoded MC-CDMA Systems","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251281","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750415/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection for IA-Precoded MC-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"1240-tc1404-silva.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116014S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750415","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6750416,"authors":[{"name":"Dung Viet Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750416/6750416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dung Viet Nguyen (S'92-M'14) received the B.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, in 2007 and in 2012, respectively.

In our previously proposed channel independent precoding scheme, an interference nulling based precoding structure is studied, which can assist to either cancel interblock interference (IBI) or separate the subspace occupied by IBI from the subspace used for information symbols. In this work, we consider a robust precoder design which combines statistical CSI at the transmitter and the interference nulling based precoding structure to gain a better performance compared to the channel independent precoding scheme. Statistical channel state information at the transmitter in the form of covariance matrix of the MIMO-OFDM channel matrix is utilized to perform the robust precoding. The design criterion for the precoder design is to minimize the maximum average mean squared error (MSE) of all the transmitted symbols during one OFDM block interval. To achieve this goal, the precoder design exhibits a similar procedure to the optimized design framework for MIMO transceivers for either perfect or statistical CSI with no interference effect, but with a distinct equivalent channel. Since the average MSEs are set equal using this precoder, the BER performance is better than our previously proposed channel independent precoder and the simulation validates this result.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Precoder Design Based on Channel Statistics for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Insufficient Cyclic Prefix","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020814.130711","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750417.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020814.130711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Precoder Design Based on Channel Statistics for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Insufficient Cyclic Prefix","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6750417/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251278","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Precoder Design Based on Channel Statistics for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Insufficient Cyclic Prefix","sourcePdf":"1249-tc1404-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072904S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750417","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6750418,"authors":[{"name":"Nir Shlezinger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750418/6750418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nir Shlezinger received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in 2011 and 2013, respectively, from Ben-Gurion University, Israel, all in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Specifically, network control and grid applications are allocated the frequency band of 0-500 kHz, commonly referred to as the narrowband PLC channel. This frequency band is characterized by strong periodic noise which results in low signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this work we propose a receiver which uses frequency shift filtering to exploit the cyclostationary properties of both the narrowband power line noise, as well as the information signal, digitally modulated using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. An adaptive implementation for the proposed receiver is presented as well. The proposed receiver is compared to existing receivers via analysis and simulation. The results show that the receiver proposed in this work obtains a substantial performance gain over previously proposed receivers, without requiring any coordination with the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020514.130421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020514.130421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Shift Filtering for OFDM Signal Recovery in Narrowband Power Line Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Shift Filtering for OFDM Signal Recovery in Narrowband Power Line Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251289","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Shift Filtering for OFDM Signal Recovery in Narrowband Power Line Communications","sourcePdf":"1283-tc1404-nir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.258317S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750418","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6750419,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Schwandter","affiliation":["Grabner Instruments, Ametek Inc., Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750419/6750419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Schwandter was born in M\u00f6dling, Austria, on March 25, 1980.

The links between the nodes are modeled as binary erasure channels. Joint source-channel coding with joint channel decoding is used to exploit the correlation. The relay performs network coding. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable rates for the binary erasure time-division multiple-access relay channel with correlated sources. We then design bilayer SC-LDPC codes and analyze their asymptotic performance for this scenario. We prove analytically that the proposed coding scheme achieves the theoretical limit for symmetric channel conditions and uncorrelated sources. Using density evolution, we furthermore demonstrate that our scheme approaches the theoretical limit also for non-symmetric channel conditions and when the sources are correlated, and we observe the threshold saturation effect that is typical for spatially-coupled systems. Finally, we give simulation results for large block lengths, which validate the DE analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020514.130317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750419.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020514.130317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward Relaying of Two Correlated Sources over the BEC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward Relaying of Two Correlated Sources over the BEC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750419/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14251285","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750419/","volume":"62","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward Relaying of Two Correlated Sources over the BEC","sourcePdf":"1324-tc1404-stefan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081063S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750419","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6750421,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-gun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750421/6750421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Gun Cho received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

It will be shown that a simple but very efficient IRBD is possible by taking advantage of a unique feature of the block-wise concatenation. For tractable performance analysis and design of IHDD and IRBD at very low error rates, we derive semi-analytic approaches. The proposed error-control systems are compared with various error-control systems with well-known coding schemes such as a product code, multiple BCH codes, a single long BCH code, and low-density parity-check codes in terms of page error rates, which confirms our claim: the proposed error-control systems achieve good tradeoffs between error-performance and complexity as compared to the traditional schemes and is also very favorable for implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021514.130287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750421.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021514.130287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Wise Concatenated BCH Codes for NAND Flash Memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Block-Wise Concatenated BCH Codes for NAND Flash Memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750421/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14251292","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750421/","volume":"62","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Wise Concatenated BCH Codes for NAND Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"1164-tc1404-cho.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123642S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750421","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6750423,"authors":[{"name":"Praneeth Jayasinghe","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6750423/6750423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Praneeth Jayasinghe (S'13) Received the B.Sc.

The source-relay and relay-destination channels undergo Rayleigh and Rician fading respectively. Different Rician fading scenarios are considered for relay-destination channel, depending on the rank of the Rician channel matrix. The channel state information is only available at the destination, and the destination computes the optimal transmit and receive beamforming vectors to maximize the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The optimal transmit beamforming vector is sent back to the transmitter via a dedicated feedback link. We derive new analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function, probability density function, and moments to statistically characterize the properties of the instantaneous SNR. These statistical properties are used to analyze the system performance in terms of the outage probability, average bit error rate, and the ergodic capacity. The performance analysis investigates the effects of the Rician factor, rank of the line-of-sight component, and number of antennas at the nodes on the system performance. The results reveal that the optimal single stream beamforming system provides better performance than an orthogonal space-time block coded based AF MIMO system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021514.130718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750423.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021514.130718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Beamforming in Fixed-Gain AF MIMO Relaying over Asymmetric Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750423/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Beamforming in Fixed-Gain AF MIMO Relaying over Asymmetric Fading Channels","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251286","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750423/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Beamforming in Fixed-Gain AF MIMO Relaying over Asymmetric Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"1201-tc1404-jaya.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118106S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750423","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6750424,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Xu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

Assuming that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter side and the receiver side, a novel low-complexity precoding algorithm is proposed to recursively construct the full-rank, the rank-deficient and the rank-one precoders with respect to particular channel realization. From the lattice theoretical perspective, the full-rank precoder is generated by using well-known dense packing lattices, which can also be recursively involved into the construction of higher-dimensional rank-deficient precoders. Moreover, the optimal solution is clearly figured out for the specific case of rank-one precoder. The closed-form expression of the achievable minimum distance is obtained and the analytical results reveal the performance bounds for different rank-constraint precoders. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed precoder as compared with the state of the art.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06750424.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021614.130377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021614.130377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Construction of Minimum Euclidean Distance-Based Precoder for Arbitrary-Dimensional MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Euclidean theory","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Euclidean distance","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum euclidean distance precoder","arbitrary dimensional MIMO systems","data vector","real valued linear precoding","multiple input multiple output system","perfect channel state information","CSI","dense packing lattice","lattice theory","channel realization","rank one precoder","rank deficient precoder","full rank precoder","low complexity precoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","linear precoding","minimum Euclidean distance","lattice theory","recursive construction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Construction of Minimum Euclidean Distance-Based Precoder for Arbitrary-Dimensional MIMO Systems","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6750424/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251283","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Construction of Minimum Euclidean Distance-Based Precoder for Arbitrary-Dimensional MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1258-tc1404-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132767S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6750424","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6750425,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Nicosia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6750425/6750425-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Krikidis (S'03-M'07-SM'12) received the diploma in Computer Engineering from the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID) of the University of Patras, Greece, in 2000, and the M.

Most of the related works presented in the literature are based on specific (and small-scale) network structures, which although give useful insights on the potential benefits of the RF-EH technology, cannot characterize the performance of general networks. In this paper, we adopt a large-scale approach of the RF-EH technology and we characterize the performance of a network with random number of transmitter-receiver pairs by using stochastic-geometry tools. Specifically, we analyze the outage probability performance and the average harvested energy, when receivers employ power splitting (PS) technique for \"simultaneous\" information and energy transfer. A non-cooperative scheme, where information/energy are conveyed only via direct links, is firstly considered and the outage performance of the system as well as the average harvested energy are derived in closed form in function of the power splitting. For this protocol, an interesting optimization problem which minimizes the transmitted power under outage probability and harvesting constraints, is formulated and solved in closed form. In addition, we study a cooperative protocol where sources' transmissions are supported by a random number of potential relays that are randomly distributed into the network. In this case, information/energy can be received at each destination via two independent and orthogonal paths (in case of relaying). We characterize both performance metrics, when a selection combining scheme is applied at the receivers and a single relay is randomly selected for cooperative diversity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020914.130825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020914.130825","startPage":"900","endPage":"912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06750425.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer in Large-Scale Networks with/without Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer in Large-Scale Networks with/without Relaying","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750425/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer in Large-Scale Networks with/without Relaying","sourcePdf":"0900-tc1403-ioan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0792S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6750425","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6750495,"authors":[{"name":"Lizbeth Escobedo","affiliation":["Autonomous University of Baja California"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7756/6750476/6750495/6750495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lizbeth Escobedo is a PhD student in computer science at the Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexico.

Polarization features are of particular interest and various examples of wide-aperture images using flight-collected and simulated data are shown to emphasize how odd and even reflectors are revealed in the imagery. Using the well-known frequency parameter from high-frequency scattering models and the Krogager polarization decomposition, wide-angle polarimetric SAR imagery is attributed with a basis of ASC primitive targets. We observe trends when extracting ASCs from 2D images and study the behavior for 10 civilian vehicles using the AFRL Civilian Vehicle Data Dome. Passenger cars categorized as the sedan class tended to exhibit scattering by cylinders, horizontal edges, and horizontal dihedrals at low elevation angle (30\u00b0) but primarily showed horizontal cylinders and horizontal dihedrals for the case of high elevation angle (60\u00b0). Likewise, the dominant scatterers for the SUV class were horizontal cylinders and horizontal edges for 30\u00b0 elevation and primarily horizontal cylinders and dihedrals for 60\u00b0 elevation. These results suggest that there are noticeable differences between the classes when viewed as primitives in the joint frequency/polarization/wide-angle SAR feature space.

Existing approaches for answering such string similarity queries follow the filter-and-verify framework by using various indexes. Typically, most approaches assume that indexes and data sets are maintained in main memory. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-tree based approaches to answer edit distance based string similarity queries, and hence, our approaches can be easily integrated into existing RDBMSs. In general, we answer string similarity search using pruning techniques employed in the metric space in that edit distance is a metric. First, we split the string collection into partitions according to a set of reference strings. Then, we index strings in all partitions using a single B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-tree based on the distances of these strings to their corresponding reference strings. Finally, we propose two approaches to efficiently answer range and KNN queries, respectively, based on the B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-tree. We prove that the optimal partitioning of the data set is an NP-hard problem, and therefore propose a heuristic approach for selecting the reference strings greedily and present an optimal partition assignment strategy to minimize the expected number of strings that need to be verified during the query evaluation. Through extensive experiments over a variety of real data sets, we demonstrate that our B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-tree based approaches provide superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques on both range and KNN queries in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2014.2309131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6945935/06750698.pdf","startPage":"2983","endPage":"2996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2014.2309131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6945935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiently Supporting Edit Distance Based String Similarity Search Using B--Trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficiently Supporting Edit Distance Based String Similarity Search Using B<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $^+$</tex><mathgraphic fileref=\"lu-ieq1-2309131.gif\" graphicformat=\"GIF\"/></formula>-Trees","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14710809","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiently Supporting Edit Distance Based String Similarity Search Using B<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $^+$</tex><mathgraphic fileref=\"lu-ieq1-2309131.gif\" graphicformat=\"GIF\"/></formula>-Trees","sourcePdf":"tkde-lu-2309131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047414S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6945935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6750698","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6750700,"authors":[{"name":"Mary L.

While previous work has demonstrated the favorable impacts that arise in the introduction of increasingly sophisticated autonomy algorithms, little work has performed an explicit comparison of different types of multiple unmanned vehicle control architectures on operator performance and workload. This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal. Further work should focus on designing a flexible automated system that allows operators to focus on a primary goal, but also facilitate lower level control when needed without degradation in performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/6814814/06750700.pdf","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2014.2304962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2014.2304962","startPage":"353","endPage":"361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Versus Vehicle-Based Control Paradigms in Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Supervision by a Single Operator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750700/","displayDocTitle":"Task Versus Vehicle-Based Control Paradigms in Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Supervision by a Single Operator","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750700/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14299491","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Task Versus Vehicle-Based Control Paradigms in Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Supervision by a Single Operator","sourcePdf":"thms-cummings-2304962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116737S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"6814814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6814814","articleId":"6750700","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6750703,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Shaharyar Khwaja","affiliation":["WINCORE Lab, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7482862/6750703/khwaj-2305871-small.gif","p":["\nAhmed Shaharyar Khwaja received the B.Sc. degree in electronic \nengineering from Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan, and the Ph.D. and \nM.Sc. degrees in signal processing and telecommunications from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the WINCORE Lab, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Initially in existing literature, this problem was solved under constraints that make it convex. However, removing the conditions for convexity and solving the NCMCS problem have been shown to improve performance. A two-step PS-based solution is presented: The first step uses uniformly distributed random sets of input points to find a solution. The set of points that gives the maximum throughput is chosen as input to the PS algorithm. Numerical examples show the improvement of the proposed method over existing genetic-algorithm-based solution, as well as PS-algorithm-based solution that uses a single set of random points as inputs. The proposed two-step solution gives higher cumulative throughput and is not sensitive to the choice of input, unlike the PS-based solution using a single set of random points as input.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2305871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7482862","startPage":"580","endPage":"591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7482862/06750703.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern-Search-Based Nonconvex Cooperative Sensing in Multiband Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750703/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pattern-Search-Based Nonconvex Cooperative Sensing in Multiband Cognitive Radio Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16035002","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern-Search-Based Nonconvex Cooperative Sensing in Multiband Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-anpalagan-2305871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112843S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7482862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7482862","articleId":"6750703","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750710,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Spachos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6819883/6750710/spach-2309138-small.gif","p":["Petros Spachos (S'08) received the Diploma degree in electronics and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Greece, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Canada, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

The low cost of sensor nodes provides a mean to deploy large sensor arrays in a variety of applications, such as civilian and environmental monitoring. Most of the WSNs operate in unlicensed spectrum bands, which have become overcrowded. As the number of the nodes that join the network increases, the need for energy-efficient, resource-constrained, and spectrum-efficient protocol also increases. Incorporating cognitive radio capability in sensor networks yields a promising networking paradigm, also known as cognitive radio sensor networks. In this paper, a cognitive networking with opportunistic routing protocol for WSNs is introduced. The objective of the proposed protocol is to improve the network performance after increasing network scalability. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated through simulations. An accurate channel model is built to evaluate the signal strength in different areas of a complex indoor environment. Then, a discrete event simulator is applied to examine the performance of the proposed protocol in comparison with two other routing protocols. Simulation results show that when comparing with other common routing protocols, the proposed protocol performs better with respect to throughput, packet delay, and total energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14331850","htmlLink":"/document/6750710/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Dynamic Routing Protocol for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"ORF-RE Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Dynamic Routing Protocol for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-spachos-2309138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089114S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6819883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6819883","articleId":"6750710","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750714,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Duan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6750714/6750714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Duan (S'12) was born in Xianning, Hubei, China, in 1987.

When full channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate receiver is known to the transmitter, the proposed precoder can simultaneously maximize to receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and attain secrecy. When only partial CSI is available, a modified Lloyd algorithm is proposed to construct codebooks for quantizing the precoder. As will be explained in this paper, the use of the proposed codebooks does not affect the secrecy of the proposed system. In addition, we propose a low-complexity postcoder to compensate the SNR loss when full CSI is not available. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system is analyzed from the view points of both recovery rate and secrecy. Based on the analyzed results, we show how to achieve full recovery rate and perfect secrecy for the proposed system. Finally, simulation results corroborate the theoretical results, and show that the proposed system enjoys different advantages when different recovery algorithms are used.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6776454/06750715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776454","startPage":"801","endPage":"813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Transmission Using MIMO Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Transmission Using MIMO Precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14219357","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6750715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan through the Cooperative Agreement","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-009-017-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Transmission Using MIMO Precoding","sourcePdf":"tifs-tsai-2309211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167858S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6776454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6776454","articleId":"6750715","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750719,"authors":[{"name":"Daohua Zhu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daohua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37070014300"},{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539031300"},{"name":"A.

The proof of the theorems is based on the hash property of an ensemble of functions, where the results are extended to general channels/sources and alternative formulas are introduced for channel capacity and the rate-distortion region. Since an ensemble of sparse matrices has a hash property, we can construct a code by using sparse matrices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750723/","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6750723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Channel Coding and Lossy Source Coding Using a Generator of Constrained Random Numbers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Coding and Lossy Source Coding Using a Generator of Constrained Random Numbers","sourcePdf":"tit-muramatsu-2309140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112899S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6750723","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6750728,"authors":[{"name":"Galina Babur","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6750728/6750728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Galina Babur received the M.S. degree in radioelectronic systems from the Tomsk State University of Control System and Radioelectronics (TUCSR), Russia, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Delft, The Netherlands, in 2009.","In 2008, she joined the International Research Centre for Telecommunications\u2014Transmission and Radar (IRCTR), TU Delft, The Netherlands.

In this paper, we study how the detectability of embedding changes is affected when the cover image is downsampled prior to embedding. This topic is important for practitioners because the vast majority of images posted on websites, image sharing portals, or attached to e-mails are downsampled. It is also relevant to researchers as the security of steganographic algorithms is commonly evaluated on databases of downsampled images. In the first part of this paper, we investigate empirically how the steganalysis results depend on the parameters of the resizing algorithm-the choice of the interpolation kernel, the scaling factor (resize ratio), antialiasing, and the downsampled pixel grid alignment. We report on several novel phenomena that appear valid universally across the tested cover sources, steganographic methods, and steganalysis features. This paper continues with a theoretical analysis of the simplest interpolation kernel - the box kernel. By fitting a Markov chain model to pixel rows, we analytically compute the Fisher information rate for any mutually independent embedding operation and derive the proper scaling of the secure payload with resizing. For least significant bit (LSB) matching and a limited range of downscaling, the theory fits experiments rather well, which indicates the existence of a new scaling law expressing the length of the secure payload when the cover size is modified by subsampling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Interpolation","Security","Databases","Payloads","Testing","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","Markov processes","sampling methods","steganography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image downsampling","steganographic security","steganalysis","digital images","statistical properties","image acquisition pipeline","image processing","embedding changes","cover image","Web sites","image sharing portals","e-mail attachment","electronic mail","steganographic algorithms","scaling factor","interpolation kernel","resize ratio","antialiasing","downsampled pixel grid alignment","Markov chain model","Fisher information rate","mutually independent embedding operation","LSB matching","least significant bit matching","subsampling"]},{"kwd":["Steganographic security","image downsampling","steganalysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6776454/06750732.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Image Downsampling on Steganographic Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Image Downsampling on Steganographic Security","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750732/","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750732/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14208879","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Image Downsampling on Steganographic Security","sourcePdf":"tifs-kodovsky-2309054-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134081S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6776454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6776454","articleId":"6750732","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6750741,"authors":[{"name":"Emadeldeen Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, Ume\u00e5 University, SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6750741/6750741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emadeldeen Hassan received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics and communication engineering from Menofia University, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

An optimization technique first developed for the optimization of load-bearing elastic structures is adapted for the purpose of metallic antenna design. The local conductivity values in a given region are used as design variables and are iteratively updated by a gradient-based optimization algorithm. Given a set of time-domain signals from exterior sources, the design objective is here to maximize the energy received by the antenna and transmitted to a coaxial cable. The optimization proceeds through a sequence of coarsely-defined lossy designs with successively increasing details and less losses as the iterations proceed. The objective function gradient is derived based on the FDTD discretization of Maxwell's equations and is expressed in terms of field solutions of the original antenna problem and an adjoint field problem. The same FDTD code, but with different wave sources, is used for both the original antenna problem and the adjoint problem. For any number of design variables, the gradient is evaluated on the basis of only two FDTD simulations, one for the original antenna problem and another for the adjoint field problem. We demonstrate the capability of the method by optimizing the radiating patch of both UWB monopole and microstrip antennas. The UWB monopole is designed to radiate over a wide frequency band 1-10 GHz, while the microstrip patch is designed for single and dual frequency band operation. In these examples, there are more than 20,000 design variables, and the algorithm typically converges in less than 150 iterations. The optimization results show a promising use of the proposed approach as a general method for conceptual design of near-resonance metallic antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06750741.pdf","startPage":"2488","endPage":"2500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2309112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2309112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6750741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Optimization of Metallic Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Equations","Mathematical model","Conductivity","Coaxial cables","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","microstrip antennas","microwave antennas","monopole antennas","optimisation","UHF antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","UWB monopole","adjoint field problem","Maxwell's equations","FDTD discretization","time-domain signals","gradient-based optimization algorithm","local conductivity values","metallic antenna design","load-bearing elastic structures","layout optimization tchnique","Topology optimization","frequency 1 GHz to 10 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjoint field problem","coaxial feed model","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","microstrip antennas","topology optimization","ultrawideband antennas (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Topology Optimization of Metallic Antennas","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6750741/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267546","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Optimization of Metallic Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-hassan-2309112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112954S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6750741","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6750742,"authors":[{"name":"Salehin Kibria","affiliation":["Center for Space Science (ANGKASA), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor D.

The circular gain improves by a significant 2 dBiC over super high frequency (SHF).","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2309136","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06750742.pdf","startPage":"2795","endPage":"2801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2309136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Compact Dual-Band Circularly Polarized Universal RFID Reader Antenna Using Ramped Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"New Compact Dual-Band Circularly Polarized Universal RFID Reader Antenna Using Ramped Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"62","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267570","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6750742/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Compact Dual-Band Circularly Polarized Universal RFID Reader Antenna Using Ramped Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tap-kibria-2309136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049691S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6750742","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6750749,"authors":[{"name":"Lennart Harnefors","affiliation":["ABB, Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6879345/6750749/6750749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lennart Harnefors (S'93\u2013M'97\u2013SM'07) was born in 1968 in Eskilstuna, Sweden.

We propose to effectively solve this special fractional QCQP by one or two convex semidefinite programmings (SDPs). For the two SDPs, one is equivalent to the original fractional QCQP with rank-one relaxation from the Charnes-Cooper transformation and the other, exploiting the optimal value of the former SDP, always has rank-one solution, which is optimal to the former SDP. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm achieves the global optimal solution to the special fractional QCQP. In specific scenarios, our proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm has lower computational complexity compared to the second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based and constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP)-based iterative algorithms. We apply the proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm on two collaborative beamforming problems in cognitive relay networks, specifically, one is the achievable rate region for two-way non-regenerative cognitive relay networks and the other is the achievable secrecy rate for one-way regenerative cognitive relay networks. Simulation results have shown that our proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm achieves the same performance as the SOCP-based iterative algorithm.

In certain areas, they operate in harsh radiation environments. In order to assure their proper functionality, the equipment or some of their sensitive components undergo several tests in experimental test areas representative of the LHC radiation fields, while specialized monitors constantly record the respective radiation levels. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of monitors using recent technology nodes (90 nm) in order to have a better estimation of the expected error rate of the devices. The H4IRRAD experimental test area has been specifically designed to reproduce the radiation field that is present within the LHC tunnel and shielded areas. It has been used to test our custom SRAM based monitors. The monitors have been exposed to a maximum dose and high energy hadron fluence of about 76 Gy and 1.3 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sup>\n cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n respectively.

In consideration of the random return of primary users (PUs), a distributed SU access approach is presented based on an adaptive carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme, in which each SU accesses multiple idle frequency slots of a licensed frequency band with adaptive activity factors. The problem of finding optimal activity factors of SUs is formulated as a potential game, and the existence, feasibility, and optimality of Nash equilibrium (NE) are analyzed. Furthermore, to achieve NEs of the formulated game, learning-based algorithms are developed in which each SU independently adjusts its activity factors. Convergence properties of best-response dynamics and log-linear dynamics are studied. Subsequently, by learning other SUs' behavior from locally available information, the convergence with probability of one to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the globally optimal solution is investigated by both analysis and simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 February 2014","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6750771/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665063","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Learning-Based Spectrum Allocation with Noisy Observations in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Learning-Based Spectrum Allocation with Noisy Observations in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-derakhshani-2309120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103183S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6750771","onlineDate":"28 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6750870,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The difficulties caused by channel distortions such as inter symbol interference (ISI) and nonlinearity can overcome by nonlinear equalizers employing neural networks. It has been shown that multilayer perceptron based equalizer (MLPE) outperform significantly linear equalizers. We present a multilayer perceptron based equalizer with decision feedback (MLP DFE) trained with the back propagation algorithm. The capacity of the MLP DFE to deal with nonlinear channels is evaluated. It is shown from simulation results that performance of the MLP DFE surpass significantly the MLPE in term of eye pattern quality, steady state mean square error (MSE), and minimum Bit Error Rate (BER). The MLPE equalizer performs poorly on the severe nonlinear channel whereas the MLP DFE equalizer provides the best performance on the two nonlinear channels considered.","doi":"10.1109/ICoSC.2013.6750956","startPage":"850","endPage":"855","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Systems and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746884/6750820/06750956.pdf","publicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Systems and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoSC.2013.6750956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive decision feedback equalizer based neural network for nonlinear channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Neurons","Multilayer perceptrons","Finite impulse response filters","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","distortion","error statistics","intersymbol interference","mean square error methods","multilayer perceptrons","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decision feedback equalizer","nonlinear channels","artificial neural network","nonlinear channel equalization","channel distortions","intersymbol interference","ISI","nonlinear equalizers","multilayer perceptron based equalizer with decision feedback","back propagation algorithm","eye pattern quality","steady state mean square error","MSE","minimum bit error rate","BER","MLPE equalizer","MLP DFE equalizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6750956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive decision feedback equalizer based neural network for nonlinear channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6750956/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14131954","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive decision feedback equalizer based neural network for nonlinear channels","confLoc":"Algiers, Algeria","sourcePdf":"0146ThAA05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081264S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746884","isNumber":"6750820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746884","xplore-issue":"6750820","articleId":"6750956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6750957,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Concept maps are a method for visual knowledge representation. In a flipped classroom, learning materials are made available to students for self-learning before class starts, while in-class time is used for student-teacher interaction. In this paper, we consider the role of concept maps created by the teacher in three different ways: a) as learning materials for students in a flipped classroom, b) as an organizational tool for the knowledge representation, and c) as an assessment method in which the questions are created for each concept so that the teacher is able to identify which concept the student has not grasped properly. This methodology was implemented in a pilot study with final year MCA students. The preliminary findings are extremely positive, further research work is in progress and large-scale experimentation is planned.","doi":"10.1109/T4E.2013.22","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750806/6751040/06751061.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Technology for Education (t4e 2013)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Technology for Education (t4e 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T4E.2013.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concept Maps for Learning in a Flipped Classroom","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Concept Maps for Learning in a Flipped Classroom","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14132161","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751061/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept Maps for Learning in a Flipped Classroom","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"5141a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036246S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750806","isNumber":"6751040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750806","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6751040","articleId":"6751061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751109,"authors":[{"name":"Carl Vondrick","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Vondrick","id":"38363144700"},{"name":"Aditya Khosla","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Khosla","id":"38289967400"},{"name":"Tomasz Malisiewicz","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Malisiewicz","id":"37424487200"},{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba","id":"38183107900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751109","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Dictionaries","Detectors","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Object detection","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection feature visualization","HOGgles","HOG goggles","detector failures","high scoring false alarms","image space","false alarms","learning algorithm","error correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object detection","hog","visualization","hoggles"]}],"abstract":"We introduce algorithms to visualize feature spaces used by object detectors. The tools in this paper allow a human to put on 'HOG goggles' and perceive the visual world as a HOG based object detector sees it. We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector's failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and indicates that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of our detection systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.8","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751109/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144881","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751109/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071857S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6751111,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc."],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407485300"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc."],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290776300"},{"name":"Shenghuo Zhu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc."],"firstName":"Shenghuo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37337370100"},{"name":"Yuanqing Lin","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc."],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37963628900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1389},"abstract":"Generic object detection is confronted by dealing with different degrees of variations in distinct object classes with tractable computations, which demands for descriptive and flexible object representations that are also efficient to evaluate for many locations. In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as region lets. A region let is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These region lets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detection mean average precision of 41.7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39.7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14.7% mean average precision on the Image Net dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4.7%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751111.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regionlets for Generic Object Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Boosting","Object detection","Deformable models","Prototypes","Search problems","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image representation","object detection","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regionlets","generic object detection","object classes","tractable computations","flexible object representations","descriptive object representations","cascaded boosting classifier","local regions","feature extraction region","detection window","arbitrary resolution","fine-grained spatial layouts","one-dimensional feature","object bounding box proposal","segmentation cues","multiclass detection benchmark datasets","detection mean average precision","PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset","VOC 2010","object categories","ImageNet dataset","deformable part-based model","DPM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regionlet","Object Detection","DPM","Deformation","Subcategory","PASCAL","ImageNet","Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Regionlets for Generic Object Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144993","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regionlets for Generic Object Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06225S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751113,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Owens","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Owens","id":"37952568200"},{"name":"Jianxiong Xiao","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Jianxiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085433858"},{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba","id":"38183107900"},{"name":"William Freeman","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Freeman","id":"37283735800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751113","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751113","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Geometry","Databases","Cameras","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","image reconstruction","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape anchor","data-driven multiview reconstruction","dense 3D reconstruction","image recognition","image patches","stereo point clouds"]}],"abstract":"We present a data-driven method for building dense 3D reconstructions using a combination of recognition and multi-view cues.

Little attention has been seriously paid to the disparity refinement. In this work, we study weighted median filtering for disparity refinement. We discover that with this refinement, even the simple box filter aggregation achieves comparable accuracy with various sophisticated aggregation methods (with the same refinement). This is due to the nice weighted median filtering properties of removing outlier error while respecting edges/structures. This reveals that the previously overlooked refinement can be at least as crucial as aggregation. We also develop the first constant time algorithm for the previously time-consuming weighted median filter. This makes the simple combination ``box aggregation + weighted median'' an attractive solution in practice for both speed and accuracy. As a byproduct, the fast weighted median filtering unleashes its potential in other applications that were hampered by high complexities. We show its superiority in various applications such as depth up sampling, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and image stylization.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.13","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751115.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751115/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144919","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751115/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070069S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6751121,"authors":[{"name":"Luk\u00e1 Neumann","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Luk\u00e1","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37076554300"},{"name":"Jiri Matas","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Matas","id":"37086774329"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751121","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":120,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":892},"abstract":"An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearest-neighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751121.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text recognition","Character recognition","Training","Robustness","Noise","Optical character recognition software","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","image representation","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scene text localization","scene text recognition","oriented stroke detection","unconstrained end-to-end text localization method","unconstrained end-to-end text recognition method","character detection","character recognition","sliding-window method","connected component method","image regions","specific relative position","stroke detection efficiency","image gradient field","oriented bar filter set","character representation","stroke detection phase","stroke level","intraclass variations","character size normalization","positioning normalization","Euclidian nearest-neighbor classifier","standard dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["text-in-the-wild","text localization","text recognition","nature scene text"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751121/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145075","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060065S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751123,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyao Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zhenyao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086794442"},{"name":"Ping Luo","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Luo","id":"37391818200"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086635638"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751123","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":188,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1767},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Lighting","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Training","Face recognition","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning identity-preserving face space","illumination variations","large pose variations","computer vision","learning based face representation","face identity-preserving feature","FIP feature extraction","face descriptors","intra-identity variance reduction","canonical view","image reconstruction layer","face image encoding","MultiPIE face database","face recognition methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition with large pose and illumination variations is a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new learning based face representation: the face identity-preserving (FIP) features. Unlike conventional face descriptors, the FIP features can significantly reduce intra-identity variances, while maintaining discriminative ness between identities. Moreover, the FIP features extracted from an image under any pose and illumination can be used to reconstruct its face image in the canonical view. This property makes it possible to improve the performance of traditional descriptors, such as LBP [2] and Gabor [31], which can be extracted from our reconstructed images in the canonical view to eliminate variations. In order to learn the FIP features, we carefully design a deep network that combines the feature extraction layers and the reconstruction layer. The former encodes a face image into the FIP features, while the latter transforms them to an image in the canonical view. Extensive experiments on the large MultiPIE face database [7] demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art face recognition methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.21","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Identity-Preserving Face Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Identity-Preserving Face Space","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751123/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144879","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751123/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Identity-Preserving Face Space","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072017S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751124,"authors":[{"name":"Xingyu Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37075598000"},{"name":"Wanli Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wanli","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37392356500"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751124","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1065},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Cascading style sheets","Support vector machines","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Optimization","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","optimisation","pattern classification","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage contextual deep learning","pedestrian detection","cascaded classifiers","multistage classifiers","backpropagation","unsupervised pretraining","stage-wise supervised training","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751124","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.22","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","abstract":"Cascaded classifiers have been widely used in pedestrian detection and achieved great success. These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of back propagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid over fitting. Experimental results on three datasets (Caltech, ETH and TUD-Brussels) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751124/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132232","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114458S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6751128,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086731469"},{"name":"Stan Sclaroff","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Sclaroff","id":"37270373800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751128","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":275,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1261},"abstract":"A novel Boolean Map based Saliency (BMS) model is proposed.

For each training example, it is assumed that there is only one class label that correctly describes it, and that all other labels are equally bad. We know however, that good and bad labels are too simplistic in many scenarios, hurting accuracy. In the realm of example dependent cost-sensitive learning, each label is instead a vector representing a data point's affinity for each of the classes. At test time, our goal is not to minimize the misclassification rate, but to maximize that affinity. We propose a novel example dependent cost-sensitive impurity measure for decision trees. Our experiments show that this new impurity measure improves test performance while still retaining the fast test times of standard classification trees. We compare our approach to classification trees and other cost-sensitive methods on three computer vision problems, tracking, descriptor matching, and optical flow, and show improvements in all three domains.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impurities","Vectors","Training","Vegetation","Decision trees","Tracking","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","decision trees","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example dependent cost-sensitive learning","decision trees","data point affinity","example dependent cost-sensitive impurity measure","standard classification trees","computer vision problems","tracking","descriptor matching","optical flow"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.31","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751133.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting Example Dependent Cost-Sensitive Learning with Decision Trees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Example Dependent Cost-Sensitive Learning with Decision Trees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751133/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751133/","accessionNumber":"14132236","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Example Dependent Cost-Sensitive Learning with Decision Trees","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063932S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6751136,"authors":[{"name":"Wangmeng Zuo","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Wangmeng","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37299957400"},{"name":"Deyu Meng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Deyu","lastName":"Meng","id":"38080754300"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086656897"},{"name":"Xiangchu Feng","affiliation":["Xidian University"],"firstName":"Xiangchu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37335387400"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085519931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751136","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1470},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Encoding","Minimization","Deconvolution","Image coding","Image restoration","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","face recognition","image classification","image coding","image restoration","iterative methods","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm","sparse coding-based image restoration problem","sparse coding-based image classification problem","nonconvex Ip-norm minimization","convex l1-norm minimization","iteratively-reweighted least squares algorithm","IRLS algorithm","iteratively thresholding method algorithm","ITM-Ip algorithm","look-up table","LUT algorithm","nonconvex Ip-norm sparse coding","soft-thresholding operator","GISA algorithm","sparse coding-based face recognition"]}],"abstract":"In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-norm minimization (0 \u2264 p <; 1) can often obtain better results than the convex l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm minimization.

An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space. Various experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the competitive state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.35","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751137.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.35","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751137/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132205","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751137/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066163S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":6751138,"authors":[{"name":"Shuran Song","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Shuran","lastName":"Song","id":"37085613509"},{"name":"Jianxiong Xiao","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Jianxiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085433858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751138","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Three-dimensional displays","Benchmark testing","Videos","Image color analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth sensors","occlusion handling","video collection","RGBD video","RGBD tracking algorithm","2D model","3D model","RGB tracking","RGBD camera"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tracking","RGBD","benchmark"]}],"abstract":"Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily.

The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input.

The method builds a model of the base-level category that can be fitted to images, producing high-quality foreground segmentation and mid-level part localizations. The model can be learnt from the typical datasets available for fine-grained categorization, where the only annotation provided is a loose bounding box around the instance (e.g. bird) in each image. Both segmentation and part localizations are then used to encode the image content into a highly-discriminative visual signature. The model is symbiotic in that part discovery/localization is helped by segmentation and, conversely, the segmentation is helped by the detection (e.g. part layout). Our model builds on top of the part-based object category detector of Felzenszwalb et al., and also on the powerful Grab Cut segmentation algorithm of Rother et al., and adds a simple spatial saliency coupling between them. In our evaluation, the model improves the categorization accuracy over the state-of-the-art. It also improves over what can be achieved with an analogous system that runs segmentation and part-localization independently.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbiotic Segmentation and Part Localization for Fine-Grained Categorization","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.47","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751149.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Symbiotic Segmentation and Part Localization for Fine-Grained Categorization","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751149/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144940","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbiotic Segmentation and Part Localization for Fine-Grained Categorization","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082559S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751150,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwen Lu","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiwen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404390100"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549600"},{"name":"Pierre Moulin","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Moulin","id":"37284080100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751150","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751150","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations.

This makes it challenging to learn detectors based on an object-level label (e.g., \"car\"). We postulate that having a richer set of labelings (at different levels of granularity) for an object, including finer-grained subcategories, consistent in appearance and view, and higher order composites - contextual groupings of objects consistent in their spatial layout and appearance, can significantly alleviate these problems. However, obtaining such a rich set of annotations, including annotation of an exponentially growing set of object groupings, is simply not feasible. We propose a weakly-supervised framework for object detection where we discover subcategories and the composites automatically with only traditional object-level category labels as input. To this end, we first propose an exemplar-SVM-based clustering approach, with latent SVM refinement, that discovers a variable length set of discriminative subcategories for each object class. We then develop a structured model for object detection that captures interactions among object subcategories and automatically discovers semantically meaningful and discriminatively relevant visual composites. We show that this model produces state-of-the-art performance on UIUC phrase object detection benchmark.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751155.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.53","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.53","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Labeling","Support vector machines","Object detection","Training","Context modeling","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","pattern clustering","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UIUC phrase object detection benchmark","object subcategories","structured model","object class","discriminative subcategories","variable length set","latent SVM refinement","exemplar-SVM-based clustering approach","object-level category label","weakly-supervised framework","spatial layout","object contextual groupings","higher-order composites","finer-grained subcategories","granularity level","camera view","pose","object appearance","multilevel framework","visual composites"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751155/","displayDocTitle":"From Subcategories to Visual Composites: A Multi-level Framework for Object Detection","accessionNumber":"14144829","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751155/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Subcategories to Visual Composites: A Multi-level Framework for Object Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0642S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6751163,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Rohrbach","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Rohrbach","id":"37547737000"},{"name":"Wei Qiu","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086756866"},{"name":"Ivan Titov","affiliation":["University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Titov","id":"37567266900"},{"name":"Stefan Thater","affiliation":["Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Thater","id":"37086758872"},{"name":"Manfred Pinkal","affiliation":["Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Pinkal","id":"37086757264"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751163","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":573},"abstract":"Humans use rich natural language to describe and communicate visual perceptions.

And second, we propose to formulate the generation of natural language as a machine translation problem using the semantic representation as source language and the generated sentences as target language. For this we exploit the power of a parallel corpus of videos and textual descriptions and adapt statistical machine translation to translate between our two languages. We evaluate our video descriptions on the TACoS dataset, which contains video snippets aligned with sentence descriptions. Using automatic evaluation and human judgments we show significant improvements over several baseline approaches, motivated by prior work. Our translation approach also shows improvements over related work on an image description task.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751163.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Translating Video Content to Natural Language Descriptions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Semantics","Training","Natural languages","Predictive models","Training data","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image representation","language translation","natural language processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video content translation","natural language descriptions","visual perceptions","semantic representation","visual content","activity labels","object labels","textual descriptions","statistical machine translation","TACoS dataset","video descriptions","image description task","computer vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Translating Video Content to Natural Language Descriptions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751163/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144925","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Translating Video Content to Natural Language Descriptions","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123059S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6751164,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Chunxiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716479900"},{"name":"Chen Change Loy","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chen Change","lastName":"Loy","id":"37411337800"},{"name":"Shaogang Gong","affiliation":["School of EECS, Queen Mary University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Shaogang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269431700"},{"name":"Guijin Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Guijin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278825900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751164","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"Owing to visual ambiguities and disparities, person re-identification methods inevitably produce sub optimal rank-list, which still requires exhaustive human eyeballing to identify the correct target from hundreds of different likely-candidates. Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank Optimization (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either \"one-shot\" or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user's searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the state-of-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just \"one shot\" feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1 re-identification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751164.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POP: Person Re-identification Post-rank Optimisation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Visualization","Cameras","Optimization","Vegetation","Context","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["person reidentification post-rank optimisation","visual ambiguity","visual disparity","exhaustive human eyeballing","ranking performance","time-consuming post rank visual search","error-prone post-rank visual search","one-shot post-rank optimization method","POP method","sparse negative selections","systematic behavioural study","searching behaviour","state-of-the-art distance metric learning","one shot feedback optimisation","performance improvement","VIPeR dataset","i-LIDS dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visual surveillance","person re-identification","ranking","manifold","information retrieval","human computer interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"POP: Person Re-identification Post-rank Optimisation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751164/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132177","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POP: Person Re-identification Post-rank Optimisation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14833S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":6751171,"authors":[{"name":"Srikumar Ramalingam","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Srikumar","lastName":"Ramalingam","id":"37298475200"},{"name":"Matthew Brand","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Brand","id":"37266356200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751171","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":596},"abstract":"We propose a novel and an efficient method for reconstructing the 3D arrangement of lines extracted from a single image, using vanishing points, orthogonal structure, and an optimization procedure that considers all plausible connectivity constraints between lines. Line detection identifies a large number of salient lines that intersect or nearly intersect in an image, but relatively a few of these apparent junctions correspond to real intersections in the 3D scene. We use linear programming (LP) to identify a minimal set of least-violated connectivity constraints that are sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct the 3D lines. In contrast to prior solutions that primarily focused on well-behaved synthetic line drawings with severely restricting assumptions, we develop an algorithm that can work on real images. The algorithm produces line reconstruction by identifying 95% correct connectivity constraints in York Urban database, with a total computation time of 1 second per image.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Junctions","Image reconstruction","Cameras","Labeling","Image edge detection","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","linear programming","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D Manhattan lines","3D lines arrangement","orthogonal structure","vanishing points","single image","optimization procedure","line detection","salient lines","3D scene","linear programming","least-violated connectivity constraints","York Urban database","connectivity constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["line drawing","single view reconstruction","junctions","linear program"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.67","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751171.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lifting 3D Manhattan Lines from a Single Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lifting 3D Manhattan Lines from a Single Image","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751171/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751171/","accessionNumber":"14144786","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifting 3D Manhattan Lines from a Single Image","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066384S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6751174,"authors":[{"name":"Avishek Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, INDIA"],"firstName":"Avishek","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37085446775"},{"name":"Venu Madhav Govindu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, INDIA"],"firstName":"Venu Madhav","lastName":"Govindu","id":"37085449937"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751174","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":619},"abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for large scale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a two step method that uses the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Vectors","Optimization","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image motion analysis","iterative methods","least squares approximations","motion estimation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust large-scale rotation averaging","relative 3D rotations","geometric structure","large scale optimization","unstructured image datasets","Internet","initialization method","Lie group structure","\u21131 optimizers","iteratively reweighted least squares approach","IRLS approach","discrete-continuous optimization method","Weiszfeld method","global camera motion estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["structure from motion","rotation averaging","lie group","robust estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.70","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751174.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751174/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751174/","accessionNumber":"14132181","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.171141S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6751179,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yuan Yang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Merced"],"firstName":"Chih-Yuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37075896400"},{"name":"Ming-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Merced"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277304600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751179","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1097},"abstract":"The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input.

The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functions for super-resolution, and efficiency of generating high-resolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors.

In this paper, we migrate such a geometric model to address face recognition and verification together through proposing a unified archetype hull ranking framework. Upon a scalable graph characterized by a compact set of archetype exemplars whose convex hull encompasses most of the training images, the proposed framework explicitly captures the relevance between any query and the stored archetypes, yielding a rank vector over the archetype hull. The archetype hull ranking is then executed for every block of face images to generate a block wise similarity measure that is achieved by comparing two different rank vectors with respect to the same archetype hull. After integrating block wise similarity measurements with learned importance weights, we accomplish a sensible face similarity measure which can support robust and effective face recognition and verification. We evaluate the face similarity measure in terms of experiments performed on three benchmark face databases Multi-PIE, Pubfig83, and LFW, demonstrating its performance superior to the state-of-the-arts.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.78","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751182.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition via Archetype Hull Ranking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751182/","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition via Archetype Hull Ranking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751182/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition via Archetype Hull Ranking","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084153S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751183,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Tzimiropoulos","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, U.K."],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimiropoulos","id":"37396761900"},{"name":"Maja Pantic","affiliation":["University of Twente, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Pantic","id":"37273162000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751183","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":900},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active appearance model","Shape","Silicon carbide","Robustness","Optimization","Jacobian matrices","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","iterative methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast AAM fitting in-the-wild","active appearance models","optimization problems","dominant cost","inverse algorithms","forward algorithms","exact AAM fitting","fast AAM fitting","training process","Matlab source code","computer vision","iterative process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Appearance Models","AAMs","Face alignment","In-the-wild"]}],"abstract":"We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most importantly for providing efficient solutions. Our formulation results in two optimization problems for fast and exact AAM fitting, and one new algorithm which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM fitting is no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the goal of investigating whether AAMs benefit from such a training process. Our results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably well and in some cases comparably with current state-of-the-art methods.

Most of them use holistic face images to recognize people. However, human faces are easily occluded by other objects in many real-world scenarios and we have to recognize the person of interest from his/her partial faces. In this paper, we propose a new partial face recognition approach by using feature set matching, which is able to align partial face patches to holistic gallery faces automatically and is robust to occlusions and illumination changes. Given each gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect key points and extract their local features. Then, we propose a Metric Learned Extended Robust Point Matching (MLERPM) method to discriminatively match local feature sets of a pair of gallery and probe samples. Lastly, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between two feature sets. Experimental results on three public face databases are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.80","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751184.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"601","endPage":"608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751184/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144883","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751184/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099623S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751186,"authors":[{"name":"Gaofeng Meng","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, P.R.

Common cases of this include pictures taken from inside a vehicle, or outdoor security cameras mounted inside a protective enclosure. At capture time, defocus can be used to remove the artifacts, but this relies on achieving a shallow depth-of-field and placement of the camera close to the window. Instead, we present a post-capture image processing solution that can remove localized rain and dirt artifacts from a single image. We collect a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs which are then used to train a specialized form of convolutional neural network. This learns how to map corrupted image patches to clean ones, implicitly capturing the characteristic appearance of dirt and water droplets in natural images. Our models demonstrate effective removal of dirt and rain in outdoor test conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751188/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14145033","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751188/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Restoring an Image Taken through a Window Covered with Dirt or Rain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoring an Image Taken through a Window Covered with Dirt or Rain","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.245085S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751191,"authors":[{"name":"Naiyan Wang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Naiyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085671305"},{"name":"Jingdong Wang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Jingdong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406478900"},{"name":"Dit-Yan Yeung","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dit-Yan","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37270592100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751191","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":660},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking","abstract":"This paper studies the visual tracking problem in video sequences and presents a novel robust sparse tracker under the particle filter framework. In particular, we propose an online robust non-negative dictionary learning algorithm for updating the object templates so that each learned template can capture a distinctive aspect of the tracked object. Another appealing property of this approach is that it can automatically detect and reject the occlusion and cluttered background in a principled way. In addition, we propose a new particle representation formulation using the Huber loss function. The advantage is that it can yield robust estimation without using trivial templates adopted by previous sparse trackers, leading to faster computation. We also reveal the equivalence between this new formulation and the previous one which uses trivial templates. The proposed tracker is empirically compared with state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging video sequences. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons show that our proposed tracker is superior and more stable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Dictionaries","Visualization","Video sequences","Object tracking","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","object tracking","particle filtering (numerical methods)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online robust nonnegative dictionary learning algorithm","visual tracking problem","video sequences","novel robust sparse tracker","particle filter framework","object tracking","particle representation formulation","Huber loss function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751191","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.87","startPage":"657","endPage":"664","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751191.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.87","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751191/","displayDocTitle":"Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14144868","htmlLink":"/document/6751191/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097104S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751193,"authors":[{"name":"Michael W.

An array of micro-lenses captures enough information that one can refocus images after acquisition, as well as shift one's viewpoint within the sub-apertures of the main lens, effectively obtaining multiple views. Thus, depth cues from both defocus and correspondence are available simultaneously in a single capture. Previously, defocus could be achieved only through multiple image exposures focused at different depths, while correspondence cues needed multiple exposures at different viewpoints or multiple cameras, moreover, both cues could not easily be obtained together. In this paper, we present a novel simple and principled algorithm that computes dense depth estimation by combining both defocus and correspondence depth cues. We analyze the x-u 2D epipolar image (EPI), where by convention we assume the spatial x coordinate is horizontal and the angular u coordinate is vertical (our final algorithm uses the full 4D EPI). We show that defocus depth cues are obtained by computing the horizontal (spatial) variance after vertical (angular) integration, and correspondence depth cues by computing the vertical (angular) variance. We then show how to combine the two cues into a high quality depth map, suitable for computer vision applications such as matting, full control of depth-of-field, and surface reconstruction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751193.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth from Combining Defocus and Correspondence Using Light-Field Cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Estimation","Apertures","Lenses","Three-dimensional displays","Noise measurement","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","microlenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light-field cameras","microlens array","image refocus","viewpoint shift","lens subapertures","multiple-image exposure","correspondence depth cue","defocus depth cue","dense depth estimation","x-u 2D epipolar image","horizontal spatial coordinate","vertical angular coordinate","full-4D EPI","horizontal variance","vertical integration","vertical variance","high-quality depth map","computer vision application","matting","depth-of-field control","surface reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Depth from Combining Defocus and Correspondence Using Light-Field Cameras","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145053","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth from Combining Defocus and Correspondence Using Light-Field Cameras","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100479S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"283","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6751195,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Yang","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085364419"},{"name":"Luc Van","firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085357527"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751195","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Training","Face","Lighting","Databases","Bismuth","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse variation dictionary learning","face recognition","single training sample per person","STSPP","query sample representation","generic training set","SVDL method","large-scale CMU multipie","FRGC","LFW databases"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample.

To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled.

Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements of our approach over state-of-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.96","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751200.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751200/","displayDocTitle":"Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144752","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751200/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.18996S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751205,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Baktashmotlagh","affiliation":["NICTA, Canberra"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Baktashmotlagh","id":"38547363600"},{"name":"Mehrtash T.

Existing techniques that have attempted to match the distributions of the source and target domains typically compare these distributions in the original feature space. This space, however, may not be directly suitable for such a comparison, since some of the features may have been distorted by the domain shift, or may be domain specific. In this paper, we introduce a Domain Invariant Projection approach: An unsupervised domain adaptation method that overcomes this issue by extracting the information that is invariant across the source and target domains. More specifically, we learn a projection of the data to a low-dimensional latent space where the distance between the empirical distributions of the source and target examples is minimized. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of visual object recognition and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a standard domain adaptation benchmark dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.100","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751205.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751205/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114768S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751207,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Bissacco","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Bissacco","id":"37333465700"},{"name":"Mark Cummins","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Cummins","id":"37590634900"},{"name":"Yuval Netzer","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Yuval","lastName":"Netzer","id":"37086764106"},{"name":"Hartmut Neven","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Hartmut","lastName":"Neven","id":"37083779200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751207","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":232,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":1470},"abstract":"We describe Photo OCR, a system for text extraction from images.

Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification, we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern data center-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency, mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751207.pdf","startPage":"785","endPage":"792","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PhotoOCR: Reading Text in Uncontrolled Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Training","Image segmentation","Text recognition","Computational modeling","Google","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","optical character recognition","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text reading","uncontrolled conditions","PhotoOCR","text extraction","smartphone imagery","text recognition","machine learning","isolated character classification","OCR system","datacenter-scale distributed language modelling","imaging conditions","public benchmark datasets","Google Translate","Android"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OCR","deep learning","text recognition","scene text"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"PhotoOCR: Reading Text in Uncontrolled Conditions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751207/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145044","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PhotoOCR: Reading Text in Uncontrolled Conditions","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063821S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6751208,"authors":[{"name":"Haoxiang Li","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ"],"firstName":"Haoxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37075630500"},{"name":"Gang Hua","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Hua","id":"37274683000"},{"name":"Zhe Lin","affiliation":["Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085396821"},{"name":"Jonathan Brandt","affiliation":["Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Brandt","id":"37384555500"},{"name":"Jianchao Yang","affiliation":["Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406108300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751208","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751208","abstract":"We propose an unsupervised detector adaptation algorithm to adapt any offline trained face detector to a specific collection of images, and hence achieve better accuracy. The core of our detector adaptation algorithm is a probabilistic elastic part (PEP) model, which is offline trained with a set of face examples. It produces a statistically aligned part based face representation, namely the PEP representation. To adapt a general face detector to a collection of images, we compute the PEP representations of the candidate detections from the general face detector, and then train a discriminative classifier with the top positives and negatives. Then we re-rank all the candidate detections with this classifier. This way, a face detector tailored to the statistics of the specific image collection is adapted from the original detector. We present extensive results on three datasets with two state-of-the-art face detectors. The significant improvement of detection accuracy over these state of-the-art face detectors strongly demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed face detector adaptation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"793","endPage":"800","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751208.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Elastic Part Model for Unsupervised Face Detector Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Detectors","Feature extraction","Adaptation models","Training","Probabilistic logic","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic elastic part model","unsupervised face detector adaptation algorithm","offline-trained face detector","PEP model","statistically-aligned part-based face representation","PEP representation","general face detector","detection accuracy improvement","candidate detection","discriminative classifier","image collection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PEP Model","Detector Adaptation","Face Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Elastic Part Model for Unsupervised Face Detector Adaptation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751208/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751208/","accessionNumber":"14144845","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Elastic Part Model for Unsupervised Face Detector Adaptation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062452S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6751212,"authors":[{"name":"Viktoriia Sharmanska","affiliation":["1ST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria"],"firstName":"Viktoriia","lastName":"Sharmanska","id":"37085719391"},{"name":"Novi Quadrianto","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Novi","lastName":"Quadrianto","id":"37681368400"},{"name":"Christoph H.

In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751215.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"856","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Optimization","Image edge detection","Visualization","Vectors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image segmentation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image cosegmentation","consistent functional maps","unsegmented images","functional maps extraction","connected image pairs","image appearance features","reduced functional space","cycle-consistency","joint optimization framework","network transportation","information sharing","iCoseg","MSRC","PASCAL data sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144957","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07202S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751224,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Borji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Borji","id":"37402402000"},{"name":"Hamed R.

We also account for the role of map smoothing. We find that, although model rankings vary, some (e.g., AWS, LG, AIM, and HouNIPS) consistently outperform other models over all datasets. Some models work well for prediction of both fixation locations and scan path sequence (e.g., Judd, GBVS). Our results show low prediction accuracy for models over emotional stimuli from the NUSEF dataset. Our last benchmark, for the first time, gauges the ability of models to decode the stimulus category from statistics of fixations, saccades, and model saliency values at fixated locations. In this test, ITTI and AIM models win over other models. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive high-level picture of the strengths and weaknesses of many popular models, and suggests future research directions in saliency modeling.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.118","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751224.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Scores, Datasets, and Models in Visual Saliency Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751224/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Scores, Datasets, and Models in Visual Saliency Prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132208","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751224/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Scores, Datasets, and Models in Visual Saliency Prediction","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090492S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751227,"authors":[{"name":"Tomer Michaeli","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Tomer","lastName":"Michaeli","id":"37396821800"},{"name":"Michal Irani","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Irani","id":"37282593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751227","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":927},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Cameras","Databases","Estimation","Image resolution","Approximation methods","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image resolution","image restoration","optical transfer function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric blind super-resolution algorithms","point spread function","PSF","camera","low-pass filter","SR methods","SR blur kernel","low-resolution image","inherent recurrence property","natural image patches","single-image SR","optimal blur kernel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Super resolution (SR) algorithms typically assume that the blur kernel is known (either the Point Spread Function 'PSF' of the camera, or some default low-pass filter, e.g. a Gaussian). However, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates when the assumed blur kernel deviates from the true one. We propose a general framework for \"blind\" super resolution. In particular, we show that: (i) Unlike the common belief, the PSF of the camera is the wrong blur kernel to use in SR algorithms. (ii) We show how the correct SR blur kernel can be recovered directly from the low-resolution image. This is done by exploiting the inherent recurrence property of small natural image patches (either internally within the same image, or externally in a collection of other natural images). In particular, we show that recurrence of small patches across scales of the low-res image (which forms the basis for single-image SR), can also be used for estimating the optimal blur kernel. This leads to significant improvement in SR results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.121","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"945","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751227/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132221","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751227/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100315S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6751233,"authors":[{"name":"David Ferstl","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz, AUSTRIA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ferstl","id":"38246302200"},{"name":"Christian Reinbacher","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz, AUSTRIA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Reinbacher","id":"37546517600"},{"name":"Rene Ranftl","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz, AUSTRIA"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Ranftl","id":"38252786800"},{"name":"Matthias Ruether","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Graz, Graz, Steiermark, AT"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Ruether"},{"name":"Horst Bischof","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz, AUSTRIA"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Bischof","id":"37270621900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751233","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":282,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1823},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Energy resolution","Optimization","Tensile stress","Spatial resolution","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image resolution","image sampling","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image guided depth upsampling","anisotropic total generalized variation","depth image upsampling","depth cameras","time of flight cameras","Kinect","lateral resolution","convex optimization problem","higher order regularization","anisotropic diffusion tensor","high resolution intensity image","numerical algorithm","benchmark depth upsampling methods","real sensor data","high resolution depth sensing","computer vision","vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["upsampling","superresolution","depth sensing","anisotropic tensor","total generalized variation","optimization","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present a novel method for the challenging problem of depth image up sampling. Modern depth cameras such as Kinect or Time-of-Flight cameras deliver dense, high quality depth measurements but are limited in their lateral resolution. To overcome this limitation we formulate a convex optimization problem using higher order regularization for depth image up sampling. In this optimization an an isotropic diffusion tensor, calculated from a high resolution intensity image, is used to guide the up sampling. We derive a numerical algorithm based on a primal-dual formulation that is efficiently parallelized and runs at multiple frames per second. We show that this novel up sampling clearly outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of speed and accuracy on the widely used Middlebury 2007 datasets. Furthermore, we introduce novel datasets with highly accurate ground truth, which, for the first time, enable to benchmark depth up sampling methods using real sensor data.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.127","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751233.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Guided Depth Upsampling Using Anisotropic Total Generalized Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751233/","displayDocTitle":"Image Guided Depth Upsampling Using Anisotropic Total Generalized Variation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751233/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Guided Depth Upsampling Using Anisotropic Total Generalized Variation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840a993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064546S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"282","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6751242,"authors":[{"name":"Dengxin Dai","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Computer Vision Lab"],"firstName":"Dengxin","lastName":"Dai","id":"37531409100"},{"name":"Hayko Riemenschneider","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Computer Vision Lab"],"firstName":"Hayko","lastName":"Riemenschneider","id":"37546400500"},{"name":"Gerhard Schmitt","affiliation":["Chair of Information Architecture, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Schmitt","id":"38474163100"},{"name":"Luc Van","affiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van","id":"37087375794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751242","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751242","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Semantics","Labeling","Lattices","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buildings (structures)","genetic algorithms","image texture","signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based facade texture synthesis","city models","photo-realistic facade images","semantic components","genetic algorithm","multiple standard datasets","building styles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facade Modeling","Facade Texture Synthesis","Facade Parsing","Facade Inpainting"]}],"abstract":"There is an increased interest in the efficient creation of city models, be it virtual or as-built.

Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection. Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches.

However, real data is often corrupted by an unknown noise distribution, which is unlikely to be purely Gaussian or Laplacian. To address this problem, this paper proposes a low-rank matrix factorization problem with a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) noise. The MoG model is a universal approximator for any continuous distribution, and hence is able to model a wider range of real noise distributions. The parameters of the MoG model can be estimated with a maximum likelihood method, while the subspace is computed with standard approaches. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in extensive synthetic, structure from motion, face modeling and background subtraction experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751276.pdf","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1344","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Matrix Factorization with Unknown Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Robustness","Principal component analysis","Gaussian noise","Computational modeling","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Gaussian noise","matrix decomposition","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust matrix factorization","unknown noise","computer vision","low-dimensional subspace","high-dimensional visual data","factorization approaches","low-rank subspace estimation","loss function","bilinear factorization","measurement matrix","L2 losses","L1 losses","Gaussian noise","Laplacian distributed noise","noise distribution","low-rank matrix factorization problem","mixture of Gaussians","noise model","MoG model","universal approximator","maximum likelihood method","face modeling","background subtraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Matrix Factorization with Unknown Noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144783","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Matrix Factorization with Unknown Noise","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10493S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751278,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed R.

Our approach classifies the activity of interest as well as identifies the relevant foreground in the video. Each activity representation is considered as a mixture distribution of BoWs captured by a Sum-Product Network (SPN). In our approach, SPN represents a linear mixture of many bags-of-words (BoWs) where each BoW represents an important foreground part of the activity. This mixture distribution is efficiently computed by organizing the BoWs in a hierarchy, where children BoWs are nested within parent BoWs. SPN allows us to model this mixture since it consists of terminal nodes representing BoWs, product nodes, and sum nodes organized in a number of layers. The products are aimed at encoding particular configurations of primitive actions, and the sums serve to capture their alternative configurations. SPN inference amounts to parsing the SPN graph, which yields the most probable explanation (MPE) of the video foreground. SPN inference has linear complexity in the number of nodes, under fairly general conditions, enabling fast and scalable recognition. The connectivity of SPN and the parameters of BoW distributions are learned under weak supervision using a variational EM algorithm. For our evaluation, we have compiled and annotated a new Volleyball dataset. Our classification accuracy and localization results are superior to those of the state of the art on current benchmarks as well as our Volleyball datasets.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751278.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1360","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition","htmlLink":"/document/6751278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14145048","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085174S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6751282,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Weinzaepfel","affiliation":["INRIA, LJK, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Weinzaepfel","id":"37945393000"},{"name":"Jerome Revaud","affiliation":["INRIA, LJK, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Revaud","id":"38096839900"},{"name":"Zaid Harchaoui","affiliation":["INRIA, LJK, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Zaid","lastName":"Harchaoui","id":"37643824200"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["INRIA, LJK, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751282","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":487,"citationCountPatent":31,"totalDownloads":2616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Integrated optics","Nonlinear optics","Optical filters","Adaptive optics","Estimation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","image matching","image motion analysis","image retrieval","image sampling","image sequences","minimisation","smoothing methods","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large displacement optical flow","deep matching","optical flow computation","computer vision systems","large displacement handling","DeepFlow algorithm","variational approach","descriptor matching algorithm","multistage architecture","interleaving convolutions","max-pooling","deep convolutional nets","dense sampling","quasidense correspondence retrieval","smoothing effect","energy minimization framework","optical flow estimation","MPI-Sintel dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical flow","large displacements","dense matching","non-rigid matching","deep convolutional networks"]}],"abstract":"Optical flow computation is a key component in many computer vision systems designed for tasks such as action detection or activity recognition. However, despite several major advances over the last decade, handling large displacement in optical flow remains an open problem. Inspired by the large displacement optical flow of Brox and Malik, our approach, termed Deep Flow, blends a matching algorithm with a variational approach for optical flow. We propose a descriptor matching algorithm, tailored to the optical flow problem, that allows to boost performance on fast motions. The matching algorithm builds upon a multi-stage architecture with 6 layers, interleaving convolutions and max-pooling, a construction akin to deep convolutional nets. Using dense sampling, it allows to efficiently retrieve quasi-dense correspondences, and enjoys a built-in smoothing effect on descriptors matches, a valuable asset for integration into an energy minimization framework for optical flow estimation. Deep Flow efficiently handles large displacements occurring in realistic videos, and shows competitive performance on optical flow benchmarks. Furthermore, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the MPI-Sintel dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.175","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751282.pdf","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751282/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145036","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062001S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"487","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6751285,"authors":[{"name":"Xinlei Chen","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xinlei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085669132"},{"name":"Abhinav Shrivastava","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37085697077"},{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291130800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751285","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":207,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":897},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751285","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Detectors","Semantics","Data mining","Computers","Knowledge based systems","Semisupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","knowledge acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NEIL","visual knowledge extraction","Web data","never ending image learner","semi-supervised learning algorithm","common sense relationships"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["never ending learning","visual knowledge base","common sense relationships","macro vision","object detection","scene classification","attributes","semi-supervised learning"]}],"abstract":"We propose NEIL (Never Ending Image Learner), a computer program that runs 24 hours per day and 7 days per week to automatically extract visual knowledge from Internet data.

In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of partial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1 and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene completion from RGB-D images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.180","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1432","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751287.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Scene Understanding by Voxel-CRF","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751287/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3D Scene Understanding by Voxel-CRF","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751287/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14145049","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Scene Understanding by Voxel-CRF","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06264S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6751290,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Engel","affiliation":["TU M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Engel","id":"38541523200"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Sturm","affiliation":["TU M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Sturm","id":"37530896300"},{"name":"Daniel Cremers","affiliation":["TU M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cremers","id":"37282875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751290","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":262,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":3691},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Visualization","Accuracy","Real-time systems","Noise","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","Gaussian distribution","image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidense visual odometry","monocular camera","real-time visual odometry","dense tracking accuracy","CPU","semidense inverse depth map estimation","camera motion tracking","dense image alignment","pixel depth estimation","image gradient","Gaussian probability distribution","computational speed","feature-based visual odometry","SLAM algorithm","robotics application","augmented reality application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SLAM","visual odometry","monocular","dense","stereo"]}],"abstract":"We propose a fundamentally novel approach to real-time visual odometry for a monocular camera. It allows to benefit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking - which does not depend on visual features - while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-dense Visual Odometry for a Monocular Camera","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.183","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751290.pdf","startPage":"1449","endPage":"1456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Semi-dense Visual Odometry for a Monocular Camera","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751290/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144780","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-dense Visual Odometry for a Monocular Camera","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053432S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6751291,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaolong Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Lab of Intelligent Information Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Jiaolong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37858426000"},{"name":"Hongdong Li","affiliation":["NICTA, Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Hongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086714636"},{"name":"Yunde Jia","affiliation":["Beijing Lab of Intelligent Information Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Yunde","lastName":"Jia","id":"37273296500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751291","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1079},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative closest point algorithm","Three-dimensional displays","Uncertainty","Upper bound","Erbium","Convergence","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image registration","iterative methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Go-ICP algorithm","3D registration","computer vision","iterative closest point algorithm","local minima","local iteration","Euclidean registration","3D pointsets","3D surfaces","L2 error","branch-and-bound scheme","BnB scheme","3D motion space","lower bounds","upper bounds","ICP error function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ICP","3D registration","shape matching"]}],"abstract":"Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D point sets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.184","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751291.pdf","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751291/","accessionNumber":"14144911","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070139S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751292,"authors":[{"name":"Shicheng Zheng","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shicheng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37076136600"},{"name":"Li Xu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xu","id":"37537702300"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751292","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Kernel","Three-dimensional displays","Image restoration","Deconvolution","Optimization","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","image restoration","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward motion deblurring","bike-mounted cameras","traffic cameras","car cameras","geometric models","depth variation","homographies","depth variation","3D planes","optimization framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deblurring","Homography","Forward Motion","Normal"]}],"abstract":"We handle a special type of motion blur considering that cameras move primarily forward or backward.

A key contribution of this work is to directly learn relational visual features, which indicate identity similarities, from raw pixels of face pairs with a hybrid deep network. The deep ConvNets in our model mimic the primary visual cortex to jointly extract local relational visual features from two face images compared with the learned filter pairs. These relational features are further processed through multiple layers to extract high-level and global features. Multiple groups of ConvNets are constructed in order to achieve robustness and characterize face similarities from different aspects. The top-layer RBM performs inference from complementary high-level features extracted from different ConvNet groups with a two-level average pooling hierarchy. The entire hybrid deep network is jointly fine-tuned to optimize for the task of face verification.

We propose a novel method, called Robust Cascaded Pose Regression (RCPR) which reduces exposure to outliers by detecting occlusions explicitly and using robust shape-indexed features. We show that RCPR improves on previous landmark estimation methods on three popular face datasets (LFPW, LFW and HELEN). We further explore RCPR's performance by introducing a novel face dataset focused on occlusion, composed of 1,007 faces presenting a wide range of occlusion patterns. RCPR reduces failure cases by half on all four datasets, at the same time as it detects face occlusions with a 80/40% precision/recall.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751298.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1520","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Face Landmark Estimation under Occlusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Face","Robustness","Estimation","Training","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","pose estimation","regression analysis","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face landmark estimation","robust cascaded pose regression","RCPR","face datasets","LFPW","LFW","HELEN","occlusion patterns","face occlusion detection","shape-indexed features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face shape","Face recognition","Landmark estimation","Pose estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Face Landmark Estimation under Occlusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751298/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132223","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Face Landmark Estimation under Occlusion","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080919S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"374","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6751300,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Ming Cheng","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Ming-Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37532083700"},{"name":"Jonathan Warrell","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Warrell","id":"37397712400"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Lin","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086752071"},{"name":"Shuai Zheng","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37071370100"},{"name":"Vibhav Vineet","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Vibhav","lastName":"Vineet","id":"38094245300"},{"name":"Nigel Crook","affiliation":["Vision Group, Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Nigel","lastName":"Crook","id":"37329984600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751300","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":316,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Visualization","Abstracts","Correlation","Histograms","Estimation","Graphical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image representation","object detection","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visually salient region detection","computer vision","image decomposition","large scale perceptually homogeneous elements","soft image abstraction representation","appearance similarity","spatial distribution","image pixels","image details","saliency values","pixel accurate annotations","mean absolute error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["salient object detection","visual attention","image abstraction","object of interest segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Detecting visually salient regions in images is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. We propose a novel method to decompose an image into large scale perceptually homogeneous elements for efficient salient region detection, using a soft image abstraction representation. By considering both appearance similarity and spatial distribution of image pixels, the proposed representation abstracts out unnecessary image details, allowing the assignment of comparable saliency values across similar regions, and producing perceptually accurate salient region detection. We evaluate our salient region detection approach on the largest publicly available dataset with pixel accurate annotations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 18 alternate methods, reducing the mean absolute error by 25.2% compared to the previous best result, while being computationally more efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.193","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751300.pdf","startPage":"1529","endPage":"1536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751300/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132197","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751300/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113162S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6751301,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Yan","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37076055800"},{"name":"Xiaoyong Shen","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaoyong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085636300"},{"name":"Li Xu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xu","id":"37537702300"},{"name":"Shaojie Zhuo","affiliation":["Qualcomm Incorporated"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37531677100"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Incorporated"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086724350"},{"name":"Liang Shen","affiliation":["Qualcomm Incorporated"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086728264"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751301","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751301","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Noise measurement","Smoothing methods","Image edge detection","Ash","Noise","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-field joint image restoration","scale map","noisy color image","dark-flashed near infrared image","image reconstruction","numerical solver","cross-field restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image restoration","denoise","cross-field","near-infrared"]}],"abstract":"Color, infrared, and flash images captured in different fields can be employed to effectively eliminate noise and other visual artifacts.

The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2^nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2^nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear sub manifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751305/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14144871","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751305/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant Tracking Using Tensor Representation with Semi-supervised Improvement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant Tracking Using Tensor Representation with Semi-supervised Improvement","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078213S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6751309,"authors":[{"name":"Peihua Li","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Peihua","lastName":"Li","id":"37078405200"},{"name":"Qilong Wang","affiliation":["Heilongjiang University"],"firstName":"Qilong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37078107500"},{"name":"Wangmeng Zuo","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Wangmeng","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37299957400"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751309","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":634},"abstract":"The symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices have been widely used in image and vision problems. Recently there are growing interests in studying sparse representation (SR) of SPD matrices, motivated by the great success of SR for vector data. Though the space of SPD matrices is well-known to form a Lie group that is a Riemannian manifold, existing work fails to take full advantage of its geometric structure. This paper attempts to tackle this problem by proposing a kernel based method for SR and dictionary learning (DL) of SPD matrices. We disclose that the space of SPD matrices, with the operations of logarithmic multiplication and scalar logarithmic multiplication defined in the Log-Euclidean framework, is a complete inner product space. We can thus develop a broad family of kernels that satisfies Mercer's condition. These kernels characterize the geodesic distance and can be computed efficiently. We also consider the geometric structure in the DL process by updating atom matrices in the Riemannian space instead of in the Euclidean space. The proposed method is evaluated with various vision problems and shows notable performance gains over state-of-the-arts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Sparse matrices","Measurement","Tin","Dictionaries","Matrix decomposition","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","dictionaries","differential geometry","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lie groups","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Log-Euclidean kernels","sparse representation","dictionary learning","symmetric positive definite matrices","SPD matrices","image problem","vision problems","SR","vector data","Lie group","Riemannian manifold","geometric structure","DL","scalar logarithmic multiplication","inner product space","Mercer condition","geodesic distance","atom matrices","Riemannian space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Log-Euclidean Kernels","Space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) Matrices","Sparse Representation","Dictionary Learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.202","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751309.pdf","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Log-Euclidean Kernels for Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Log-Euclidean Kernels for Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751309/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751309/","accessionNumber":"14132258","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Log-Euclidean Kernels for Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086711S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6751312,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxiong Xiao","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Jianxiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085433858"},{"name":"Andrew Owens","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Owens","id":"37952568200"},{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba","id":"38183107900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751312","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":271,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":866},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Cameras","Databases","Image reconstruction","Labeling","Semantics","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image colour analysis","image reconstruction","motion estimation","video databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["big spaces","SfM","object labels","scene understanding datasets","3D space representation","large-scale RGB-D video database","camera pose","hand-labeling videos","structure from motion","intuitive labeling tool","partial image reconstruction","object-to-object correspondences","fixed-size bounding box","SUN3D database","source code","generalized bundle adjustment","Web-based 3D annotation tool"]}],"abstract":"Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces.

For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences.

The absorbed time of transient node measures its global similarity with all absorbing nodes, and thus salient objects can be consistently separated from the background when the absorbed time is used as a metric. Since the time from transient node to absorbing nodes relies on the weights on the path and their spatial distance, the background region on the center of image may be salient.

In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences' visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the Visual Interpretation of Sentences","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.211","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751319.pdf","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Learning the Visual Interpretation of Sentences","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751319/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145106","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the Visual Interpretation of Sentences","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.251431S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751323,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Different from prior work, which relies on detectors for specific object parts, we propose to localize distinctive details by roughly aligning the objects using just the overall shape, since implicit to fine-grained categorization is the existence of a super-class shape shared among all classes. The alignments are then used to transfer part annotations from training images to test images (supervised alignment), or to blindly yet consistently segment the object in a number of regions (unsupervised alignment). We furthermore argue that in the distinction of fine grained sub-categories, classification-oriented encodings like Fisher vectors are better suited for describing localized information than popular matching oriented features like HOG.

Typically, the first group optimizes appearance log-likelihoods in combination with some spacial regularization. This problem is relatively simple and many methods guarantee globally optimal results. The second group treats model parameters as additional variables transforming simple segmentation energies into high-order NP-hard functionals (Zhu-Yuille, Chan-Vese, Grab Cut, etc). It is known that such methods indirectly minimize the appearance overlap between the segments. We propose a new energy term explicitly measuring L1 distance between the object and background appearance models that can be globally maximized in one graph cut. We show that in many applications our simple term makes NP-hard segmentation functionals unnecessary. Our one cut algorithm effectively replaces approximate iterative optimization techniques based on block coordinate descent.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.222","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751330.pdf","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GrabCut in One Cut","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751330/","displayDocTitle":"GrabCut in One Cut","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132184","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751330/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GrabCut in One Cut","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110795S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6751331,"authors":[{"name":"Anestis Papazoglou","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Anestis","lastName":"Papazoglou","id":"37086764969"},{"name":"Vittorio Ferrari","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37274804600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751331","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":309,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion segmentation","Optical imaging","Adaptive optics","Labeling","Estimation","Object segmentation","Optical variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image segmentation","object recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonrigid deformation","video shot","clustering point","video object segmentation","background subtraction technique","object motion analysis","foreground object separation","unconstrained video","fast object segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video","video segmentation"]}],"abstract":"We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video.

In this paper, a new framework based on sparse coding and temporal pyramid matching (TPM) is proposed for depth-based human action recognition. Especially, a discriminative class-specific dictionary learning algorithm is proposed for sparse coding. By adding the group sparsity and geometry constraints, features can be well reconstructed by the sub-dictionary belonging to the same class, and the geometry relationships among features are also kept in the calculated coefficients. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets captured by depth cameras.

Recent progress in this area is due to new local features and models that capture spatio-temporal structure between local features, or human-object interactions. Instead of working towards more complex models, we focus on the low-level features and their encoding. We evaluate the use of Fisher vectors as an alternative to bag-of-word histograms to aggregate a small set of state-of-the-art low-level descriptors, in combination with linear classifiers. We present a large and varied set of evaluations, considering (i) classification of short actions in five datasets, (ii) localization of such actions in feature-length movies, and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events. We find that for basic action recognition and localization MBH features alone are enough for state-of-the-art performance. For complex events we find that SIFT and MFCC features provide complementary cues. On all three problems we obtain state-of-the-art results, while using fewer features and less complex models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751336.pdf","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1824","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action and Event Recognition with Fisher Vectors on a Compact Feature Set","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Vectors","Encoding","Hidden Markov models","Histograms","Motion pictures","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","compact feature set","uncontrolled video","computer vision problem","low-level features","human-object interactions","spatio-temporal structure","local features","Fisher vectors","bag-of-word histograms","linear classifiers","feature-length movies","complex event recognition","MBH feature localization","SIFT features","complementary cues"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["action recognition","action localization","event recognition","Fisher vectors","bag of visual words","evaluation","uncontrolled realistic videos","dense trajectories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Action and Event Recognition with Fisher Vectors on a Compact Feature Set","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751336/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144920","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action and Event Recognition with Fisher Vectors on a Compact Feature Set","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121795S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6751339,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Doll\u00e1r","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Doll\u00e1r","id":"37547761500"},{"name":"C.

Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains real time performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset.

The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of-the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.241","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751349.pdf","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751349/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144816","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069938S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"630","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751352,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Yu","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37071812200"},{"name":"Junzhou Huang","affiliation":["Univ. of Texas, Arlington"],"firstName":"Junzhou","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293532300"},{"name":"Shaoting Zhang","affiliation":["Univ. of Texas, Arlington"],"firstName":"Shaoting","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37535984700"},{"name":"Wang Yan","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086793098"},{"name":"Dimitris N.

We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases.

This is a fundamental task whose output may serve as the basis for further computer vision tasks like segmentation, resizing, tracking and so forth. In this paper we propose a novel salient region detection algorithm by integrating three important visual cues namely uniqueness, focus ness and objectness (UFO). In particular, uniqueness captures the appearance-derived visual contrast, focus ness reflects the fact that salient regions are often photographed in focus, and objectness helps keep completeness of detected salient regions. While uniqueness has been used for saliency detection for long, it is new to integrate focus ness and objectness for this purpose. In fact, focus ness and objectness both provide important saliency information complementary of uniqueness. In our experiments using public benchmark datasets, we show that, even with a simple pixel level combination of the three components, the proposed approach yields significant improvement compared with previously reported methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751356.pdf","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1983","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image color analysis","Estimation","Image segmentation","Computer vision","Visualization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["salient region detection","UFO","human visual attention","uniqueness focusness and objectness","visual cues","computer vision tasks","appearance-derived visual contrast","public benchmark datasets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144917","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840b976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072749S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6751364,"authors":[{"name":"Qinxun Bai","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Qinxun","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086675025"},{"name":"Zheng Wu","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404349500"},{"name":"Stan Sclaroff","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Sclaroff","id":"37270373800"},{"name":"Margrit Betke","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Margrit","lastName":"Betke","id":"37324257900"},{"name":"Camille Monnier","affiliation":["Charles River Analytics, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Camille","lastName":"Monnier","id":"37946111100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751364","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Bayes methods","Reliability","Visualization","Boosting","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","image classification","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized ensemble tracking algorithm","time-varying appearance","visual object tracking","weak classifiers","random variable","posterior distribution","Bayesian manner","tracking-by-detection implementation","strong classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classifier ensemble","online learning","tracking-by-detection"]}],"abstract":"We propose a randomized ensemble algorithm to model the time-varying appearance of an object for visual tracking. In contrast with previous online methods for updating classifier ensembles in tracking-by-detection, the weight vector that combines weak classifiers is treated as a random variable and the posterior distribution for the weight vector is estimated in a Bayesian manner. In essence, the weight vector is treated as a distribution that reflects the confidence among the weak classifiers used to construct and adapt the classifier ensemble. The resulting formulation models the time-varying discriminative ability among weak classifiers so that the ensembled strong classifier can adapt to the varying appearance, backgrounds, and occlusions. The formulation is tested in a tracking-by-detection implementation. Experiments on 28 challenging benchmark videos demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve results comparable to and often better than those of state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.255","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751364.pdf","startPage":"2040","endPage":"2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Ensemble Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751364/","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Ensemble Tracking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751364/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Ensemble Tracking","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060498S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751366,"authors":[{"name":"Wanli Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wanli","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37392356500"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086682271"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751366","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":345,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3731},"abstract":"Feature extraction, deformation handling, occlusion handling, and classification are four important components in pedestrian detection.

Discriminative functions are then learned on these prototype sets, and image are represented by the concatenation of their projected values onto the prototypes (similarities to them) for further classification. Experiments on four standard datasets show three interesting phenomena: (1) our method consistently outperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification, (2) our method lets itself combine well with these methods, and (3) our method works well for self-taught image classification where unlabeled data are not coming from the same distribution as labeled ones, but rather from a random collection of images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751368/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144995","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble Projection for Semi-supervised Image Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble Projection for Semi-supervised Image Classification","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076265S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6751370,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiye Wang","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085872360"},{"name":"Ran He","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"He","id":"37589818700"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085358759"},{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311071800"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":136,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":829},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Iterative methods","Linear programming","Principal component analysis","Linear regression","Correlation","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled feature spaces","cross-modal matching","multimodal data","coupled feature selection","coupled linear regression framework","cross-modal data matching","trace norm","low-rank constraint","different modal data","iterative algorithm","half-quadratic minimization","regularized linear regression problem","cross-modal datasets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.261","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751370.pdf","startPage":"2088","endPage":"2095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Coupled Feature Spaces for Cross-Modal Matching","abstract":"Cross-modal matching has recently drawn much attention due to the widespread existence of multimodal data. It aims to match data from different modalities, and generally involves two basic problems: the measure of relevance and coupled feature selection. Most previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem. In this paper, we propose a novel coupled linear regression framework to deal with both problems. Our method learns two projection matrices to map multimodal data into a common feature space, in which cross-modal data matching can be performed. And in the learning procedure, the ell_21-norm penalties are imposed on the two projection matrices separately, which leads to select relevant and discriminative features from coupled feature spaces simultaneously. A trace norm is further imposed on the projected data as a low-rank constraint, which enhances the relevance of different modal data with connections. We also present an iterative algorithm based on half-quadratic minimization to solve the proposed regularized linear regression problem. The experimental results on two challenging cross-modal datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132201","htmlLink":"/document/6751370/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning Coupled Feature Spaces for Cross-Modal Matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Coupled Feature Spaces for Cross-Modal Matching","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057915S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6751377,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiqi Guo","firstName":"Ruiqi","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Derek Hoiem","firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Hoiem"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751377","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":320},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Training","Shape","Layout","Labeling","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support surface prediction","indoor scenes","RGBD image","3D space","3D scene models","NYU dataset","pipeline","floor space","walls"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RGBD","scene understanding","image parsing","support surfaces"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.266","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751377.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes","abstract":"In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image.

The derived shape guidance is used in the subsequent graph-cut-based figure-ground segmentation. The final segmentation result is obtained by merging the segmentation results in the bounding boxes. We conduct an extensive analysis of the effect of object bounding box accuracy.

Besides, a new composite statistical inference approach is proposed for refining the obtained segment tracks, which breaks down the initial segment proposals and recombines for better ones by utilizing high-order statistic estimates from the appearance model and enforcing temporal consistency. For evaluating the algorithm, a dataset, SegTrack v2, is collected with about 1,000 frames with pixel-level annotations. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the dataset, showing its efficiency and robustness to challenges in different video sequences.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2192","endPage":"2199","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751383.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751383/","displayDocTitle":"Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144877","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129945S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"256","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6751384,"authors":[{"name":"Mingsheng Long","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingsheng","lastName":"Long","id":"38003407600"},{"name":"Jianmin Wang","affiliation":["TNLIST, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086636694"},{"name":"Guiguang Ding","affiliation":["TNLIST, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guiguang","lastName":"Ding","id":"37391235400"},{"name":"Jiaguang Sun","affiliation":["TNLIST, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaguang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37293639200"},{"name":"Philip S.

Unlike previous action-related work, the discovery of patch classifiers is posed as a strongly-supervised process. Specifically, key point labels (e.g., position) across space time are used in a data-driven training process to discover patches that are highly clustered in the space time key point configuration space. To support this process, a new human action dataset consisting of challenging consumer videos is introduced, where notably the action label, the 2D position of a set of key points and their visibilities are provided for each video frame. On a novel input video, each acteme is used in a sliding volume scheme to yield a set of sparse, non-overlapping detections. These detections provide the intermediate substrate for segmenting out the action. For action classification, the proposed representation shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art low-level features, while providing spatiotemporal localization as additional output, which sheds further light into detailed action understanding.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.280","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2248","endPage":"2255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751390/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144810","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073032S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6751392,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhou","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085730733"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549600"},{"name":"Kui Jia","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Jia","id":"37683115500"},{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38244098700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751392","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Optimization","Videos","Pattern recognition","Data models","Learning systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["latent task sharing","action recognition","multiple-related machine learning tasks","generalization performance","knowledge sharing","videos","jump motion","multitask learning method","classifier reconstruction","basic motion pattern","classifier discrimination power enhancement","sparsity regularizer","action categories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Latent Task","Action Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751392","abstract":"Sharing knowledge for multiple related machine learning tasks is an effective strategy to improve the generalization performance. In this paper, we investigate knowledge sharing across categories for action recognition in videos. The motivation is that many action categories are related, where common motion pattern are shared among them (e.g. diving and high jump share the jump motion). We propose a new multi-task learning method to learn latent tasks shared across categories, and reconstruct a classifier for each category from these latent tasks. Compared to previous methods, our approach has two advantages: (1) The learned latent tasks correspond to basic motion patterns instead of full actions, thus enhancing discrimination power of the classifiers. (2) Categories are selected to share information with a sparsity regularizer, avoiding falsely forcing all categories to share knowledge. Experimental results on multiple public data sets show that the proposed approach can effectively transfer knowledge between different action categories to improve the performance of conventional single task learning methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.281","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2271","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751392.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Share Latent Tasks for Action Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Share Latent Tasks for Action Recognition","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751392/","accessionNumber":"14145093","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751392/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Share Latent Tasks for Action Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104765S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6751393,"authors":[{"name":"Guangnan Ye","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Guangnan","lastName":"Ye","id":"38467122500"},{"name":"Dong Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38467055200"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["IBM T.

Hashing methods map high-dimensional features to compact binary codes that are efficient to match and robust in preserving original similarity. However, most of the existing hashing methods treat videos as a simple aggregation of independent frames and index each video through combining the indexes of frames. The structure information of videos, e.g., discriminative local visual commonality and temporal consistency, is often neglected in the design of hash functions. In this paper, we propose a supervised method that explores the structure learning techniques to design efficient hash functions. The proposed video hashing method formulates a minimization problem over a structure-regularized empirical loss. In particular, the structure regularization exploits the common local visual patterns occurring in video frames that are associated with the same semantic class, and simultaneously preserves the temporal consistency over successive frames from the same video. We show that the minimization objective can be efficiently solved by an Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. Extensive experiments on two large video benchmark datasets (up to around 150K video clips with over 12 million frames) show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.282","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751393.pdf","startPage":"2272","endPage":"2279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Video Hashing via Structure Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751393/","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Video Hashing via Structure Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751393/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Video Hashing via Structure Learning","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07775S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6751397,"authors":[{"name":"Caglayan Dicle","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Caglayan","lastName":"Dicle","id":"38235167200"},{"name":"Octavia I.

The proposed method uses motion dynamics as a cue to distinguish targets with similar appearance, minimize target mis-identification and recover missing data. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a Generalized Linear Assignment (GLA) coupled with efficient procedures to recover missing data and estimate the complexity of the underlying dynamics. The proposed approach works with track lets of arbitrary length and does not assume a dynamical model a priori, yet it captures the overall motion dynamics of the targets.

In contrast, our method aims to exploit reference images where the shared content may have undergone substantial photometric and non-rigid geometric transformations, as these are the kind of reference images most likely to be found in personal photo albums. Our approach builds upon a recent method for example-based deblurring using non-rigid dense correspondence (NRDC) [HaCohen et al. 2011] and extends it in two ways. First, we suggest exploiting information from the reference image not only for blur kernel estimation, but also as a powerful local prior for the non-blind deconvolution step. Second, we introduce a simple yet robust technique for spatially varying blur estimation, rather than assuming spatially uniform blur. Unlike the above previous method, which has proven successful only with simple deblurring scenarios, we demonstrate that our method succeeds on a variety of real-world examples. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.296","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2384","endPage":"2391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751407/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145080","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070168S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751410,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, UK"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086766569"},{"name":"Yiming Ying","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, UK"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Ying","id":"37086771238"},{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086769364"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751410","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Face","Principal component analysis","Robustness","Learning systems","Vectors","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["similarity metric learning","face recognition","unconstrained face verification","regularization framework","objective function","large intra-personal variations","convex optimization problem","global solution","Labeled Faces in the Wild database","LFW database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unconstrained face recognition","metric learning","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"Recently, there is a considerable amount of efforts devoted to the problem of unconstrained face verification, where the task is to predict whether pairs of images are from the same person or not.

Namely, the test faces have significantly different poses compared with the registered faces. In this paper, we propose a high-level feature learning scheme to extract pose-invariant identity feature for face recognition. First, we build a single-hidden-layer neural network with sparse constraint, to extract pose-invariant feature in a supervised fashion. Second, we further enhance the discriminative capability of the proposed feature by using multiple random faces as the target values for multiple encoders. By enforcing the target values to be unique for input faces over different poses, the learned high-level feature that is represented by the neurons in the hidden layer is pose free and only relevant to the identity information. Finally, we conduct face identification on CMU Multi-PIE, and verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases, where identification rank-1 accuracy and face verification accuracy with ROC curve are reported. These experiments demonstrate that our model is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches on handling pose variations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.300","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751411.pdf","startPage":"2416","endPage":"2423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751411/","displayDocTitle":"Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144794","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751411/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11198S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751413,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Li","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086793415"},{"name":"Michael S.

Our approach exploits the subtle changes in the reflection with respect to the background in a small set of images taken at slightly different view points. Key to this idea is the use of SIFT-flow to align the images such that a pixel-wise comparison can be made across the input set. Gradients with variation across the image set are assumed to belong to the reflected scenes while constant gradients are assumed to belong to the desired background scene. By correctly labelling gradients belonging to reflection or background, the background scene can be separated from the reflection interference. Unlike previous approaches that exploit motion, our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the background or reflected scenes' geometry, nor requires the reflection to be static. This makes our approach practical for use in casual imaging scenarios. Our approach is straight forward and produces good results compared with existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2439","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751413.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Reflection Change for Automatic Reflection Removal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image reconstruction","Interference","Glass","Cameras","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image sequences","interference suppression","reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflected scene geometry","background scene","image set","SIFT-flow","glass surface","reflection interference removal","automatic reflection removal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Reflection Change for Automatic Reflection Removal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751413/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751413/","accessionNumber":"14144760","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Reflection Change for Automatic Reflection Removal","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057826S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6751415,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Zhang","affiliation":["University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240473600"},{"name":"Chris Ding","affiliation":["University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Ding","id":"37284220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751415","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751415","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","Principal component analysis","Vectors","Matrix decomposition","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image representation","matrix decomposition","minimisation","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outlier noise","feature noise","RTD model","L1-norm loss function","L1-norm based tensor analysis","standard tensor decomposition","tensor factorization-based image storage","PCA-based method","image occlusion","squared error sum minimization","Frobenius norm","tensor analysis approach","machine learning application","computer vision","high-dimensional data","tensor-based algorithm","effective image representation","robust tucker tensor decomposition model"]}],"abstract":"Many tensor based algorithms have been proposed for the study of high dimensional data in a large variety of computer vision and machine learning applications. However, most of the existing tensor analysis approaches are based on Frobenius norm, which makes them sensitive to outliers, because they minimize the sum of squared errors and enlarge the influence of both outliers and large feature noises. In this paper, we propose a robust Tucker tensor decomposition model (RTD) to suppress the influence of outliers, which uses L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm loss function. Yet, the optimization on L1-norm based tensor analysis is much harder than standard tensor decomposition. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to solve our RTD model. Moreover, tensor factorization-based image storage needs much less space than PCA based methods. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and verify the robustness against image occlusions. Both numerical and visual results show that our RTD model is consistently better against the existence of outliers than previous tensor and PCA methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.304","startPage":"2448","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.304","endPage":"2455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Tucker Tensor Decomposition for Effective Image Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Tucker Tensor Decomposition for Effective Image Representation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751415/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14144839","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Tucker Tensor Decomposition for Effective Image Representation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057599S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751421,"authors":[{"name":"De-An Huang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"De-An","lastName":"Huang","id":"38474825600"},{"name":"Yu-Chiang Frank Wang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chiang Frank","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086746667"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751421","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":601},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image recognition","Image generation","Face recognition","Training","Data models","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","feature extraction","gesture recognition","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled dictionary-feature space learning","cross-domain image synthesis","cross-domain image recognition","computer vision","pattern recognition","unified model","improved image representation","single-image super-resolution","cross-view action recognition","sketch-to-photo face recognition"]}],"abstract":"Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition.

The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems.

In this paper, we exploit the pair wise salience distribution relationship between pedestrian images, and solve the person re-identification problem by proposing a salience matching strategy. To handle the misalignment problem in pedestrian images, patch matching is adopted and patch salience is estimated. Matching patches with inconsistent salience brings penalty. Images of the same person are recognized by minimizing the salience matching cost.

Such detectors have recently been shown to benefit many applications such as speeding-up class-specific object detection, weakly supervised learning of object detectors and object discovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel and very efficient method for generic object detection based on a randomized version of Prim's algorithm. Using the connectivity graph of an image's super pixels, with weights modelling the probability that neighbouring super pixels belong to the same object, the algorithm generates random partial spanning trees with large expected sum of edge weights. Object localizations are proposed as bounding-boxes of those partial trees. Our method has several benefits compared to the state-of-the-art. Thanks to the efficiency of Prim's algorithm, it samples proposals very quickly: 1000 proposals are obtained in about 0.7s. With proposals bound to super pixel boundaries yet diversified by randomization, it yields very high detection rates and windows that tightly fit objects. In extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and SUN2012 benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves over state-of-the-art competitors for a wide range of evaluation scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14144769","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Prime Object Proposals with Randomized Prim's Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prime Object Proposals with Randomized Prim's Algorithm","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068817S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6751432,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elhoseiny","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elhoseiny","id":"38548494500"},{"name":"Babak Saleh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37076012700"},{"name":"Ahmed Elgammal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elgammal","id":"37269442400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751432","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Training","Optimization","Correlation","Transfer functions","Semantics","Birds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","optimisation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-shot learning","purely textual descriptions","object categories","domain adaptation","regression adaptation","constrained optimization formulation","regression function","knowledge transfer function","fine-grained categorization datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero shot learning","object recognition","fine grained object recognition","computer vision","domain adaptation"]}],"abstract":"The main question we address in this paper is how to use purely textual description of categories with no training images to learn visual classifiers for these categories.

Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset that includes 3,673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.329","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751440.pdf","startPage":"2648","endPage":"2655","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14144934","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751440/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089886S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6751442,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Zhu","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38194869600"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086656897"},{"name":"Wangmeng Zuo","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wangmeng","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37299957400"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37072907600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751442","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Support vector machines","Training","Learning systems","Covariance matrices","Face recognition","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point-to-set distance","set-to-set distance","PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning","PSD","SSD","point-to-point distance","covariance matrix","point-to-set distance metric learning","PSDML","set-to-set distance metric learning","SSDML","support vector machine solvers","multiclass visual classification","gender classification","digit recognition","object categorization","face recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751442","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.331","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","abstract":"Most of the current metric learning methods are proposed for point-to-point distance (PPD) based classification.

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities ``in-the-wild''. We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned from Web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects, we also use a Web-scale language model to ``fill in'' novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751448/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14132209","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751448/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"YouTube2Text: Recognizing and Describing Arbitrary Activities Using Semantic Hierarchies and Zero-Shot Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"YouTube2Text: Recognizing and Describing Arbitrary Activities Using Semantic Hierarchies and Zero-Shot Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078326S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6751449,"authors":[{"name":"Cewu Lu","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Cewu","lastName":"Lu","id":"38247997300"},{"name":"Jianping Shi","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Shi","id":"37075796500"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751449","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":328,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2386},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Videos","Testing","Training","Surveillance","Training data","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","object detection","optimisation","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speedy abnormal event detection","MATLAB","surveillance videos","efficient sparse combination learning framework","detection phase","short running time","small-scale least square optimization steps","ordinary desktop PC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["abnormal event detection","real-time","surveillance video","dictionary learning"]}],"abstract":"Speedy abnormal event detection meets the growing demand to process an enormous number of surveillance videos.

Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2759","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751453.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751453/","displayDocTitle":"The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145025","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072626S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6751455,"authors":[{"name":"Vicente Ordonez","affiliation":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Ordonez","id":"37567535100"},{"name":"Jia Deng","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Deng","id":"38307037500"},{"name":"Yejin Choi","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Yejin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37960943500"},{"name":"Alexander C.

However, it is hard to fairly compare trackers due to many parameters need to be tuned in the experimental configurations. On the other hand, when introducing a new tracker, a recent trend is to validate it by comparing it with several existing ones. Such an evaluation may have subjective biases towards the new tracker which typically performs the best. This is mainly due to the difficulty to optimally tune all its competitors and sometimes the selected testing sequences. By contrast, little subjective bias exists towards the second best ones in the contest. This observation inspires us with a novel perspective towards inhibiting subjective bias in evaluating trackers by analyzing the results between the second bests. In particular, we first collect all tracking papers published in major computer vision venues in recent years. From these papers, after filtering out potential biases in various aspects, we create a dataset containing many records of comparison results between various visual trackers. Using these records, we derive performance rankings of the involved trackers by four different methods. The first two methods model the dataset as a graph and then derive the rankings over the graph, one by a rank aggregation algorithm and the other by a PageRank-like solution. The other two methods take the records as generated from sports contests and adopt widely used Elo's and Glicko's rating systems to derive the rankings. The experimental results are presented and may serve as a reference for related research.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding the Best from the Second Bests - Inhibiting Subjective Bias in Evaluation of Visual Tracking Algorithms","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.346","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751457.pdf","startPage":"2784","endPage":"2791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Finding the Best from the Second Bests - Inhibiting Subjective Bias in Evaluation of Visual Tracking Algorithms","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751457/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145055","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding the Best from the Second Bests - Inhibiting Subjective Bias in Evaluation of Visual Tracking Algorithms","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145155S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751463,"authors":[{"name":"Netalee Efrat","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Netalee","lastName":"Efrat","id":"37086285695"},{"name":"Daniel Glasner","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Glasner","id":"37397736200"},{"name":"Alexander Apartsin","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Apartsin","id":"37418733500"},{"name":"Boaz Nadler","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Boaz","lastName":"Nadler","id":"37396595600"},{"name":"Anat Levin","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Anat","lastName":"Levin","id":"37282624200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751463","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Cameras","Image reconstruction","Sensitivity","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image reconstruction","image resolution","image restoration","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image priors","single-image super-resolution","single-image SR","reconstruction constraint","blurred downsampled high-resolution output image","low-resolution input image","gradient regularization","empirical analysis","SR algorithm sensitivity","default blur models","raw low-resolution image reconstruction","camera blur estimation"]}],"abstract":"Over the past decade, single image Super-Resolution (SR) research has focused on developing sophisticated image priors, leading to significant advances. Estimating and incorporating the blur model, that relates the high-res and low-res images, has received much less attention, however. In particular, the reconstruction constraint, namely that the blurred and down sampled high-res output should approximately equal the low-res input image, has been either ignored or applied with default fixed blur models. In this work, we examine the relative importance of the image prior and the reconstruction constraint. First, we show that an accurate reconstruction constraint combined with a simple gradient regularization achieves SR results almost as good as those of state-of-the-art algorithms with sophisticated image priors. Second, we study both empirically and theoretically the sensitivity of SR algorithms to the blur model assumed in the reconstruction constraint. We find that an accurate blur model is more important than a sophisticated image prior. Finally, using real camera data, we demonstrate that the default blur models of various SR algorithms may differ from the camera blur, typically leading to over-smoothed results. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately estimating camera blur in reconstructing raw lowers images acquired by an actual camera.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.352","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"2832","endPage":"2839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Blur Models vs. Image Priors in Single Image Super-resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Blur Models vs. Image Priors in Single Image Super-resolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751463/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14132234","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Blur Models vs. Image Priors in Single Image Super-resolution","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079843S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6751468,"authors":[{"name":"Dihong Gong","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dihong","lastName":"Gong"},{"name":"Zhifeng Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Dahua Lin","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Chicago"],"firstName":"Dahua","lastName":"Lin","id":"37416122100"},{"name":"Jianzhuang Liu","affiliation":["Media Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

In spite of the great progress in face recognition techniques, reliably recognizing faces across ages remains a difficult task. The facial appearance of a person changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. Hence, the key to tackle this problem is to separate the variation caused by aging from the person-specific features that are stable. Specifically, we propose a new method, called Hidden Factor Analysis (HFA). This method captures the intuition above through a probabilistic model with two latent factors: an identity factor that is age-invariant and an age factor affected by the aging process. Then, the observed appearance can be modeled as a combination of the components generated based on these factors. We also develop a learning algorithm that jointly estimates the latent factors and the model parameters using an EM procedure. Extensive experiments on two well-known public domain face aging datasets: MORPH (the largest public face aging database) and FGNET, clearly show that the proposed method achieves notable improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Factor Analysis for Age Invariant Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.357","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751468.pdf","startPage":"2872","endPage":"2879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Factor Analysis for Age Invariant Face Recognition","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751468/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144898","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Factor Analysis for Age Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840c872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099433S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751479,"authors":[{"name":"Basura Fernando","affiliation":["ESAT-PSI, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Basura","lastName":"Fernando","id":"37997075800"},{"name":"Amaury Habrard","affiliation":["18 rue Benoit Lauras, Laboratoire Hubert Curien UMR 5516, France"],"firstName":"Amaury","lastName":"Habrard","id":"37680538900"},{"name":"Marc Sebban","affiliation":["18 rue Benoit Lauras, Laboratoire Hubert Curien UMR 5516, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Sebban","id":"37284189200"},{"name":"Tinne Tuytelaars","affiliation":["ESAT-PSI, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tinne","lastName":"Tuytelaars","id":"37282935100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751479","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":514,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":2020},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751479","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Context","Manifolds","Principal component analysis","Support vector machines","Covariance matrices","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","image classification","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised visual domain adaptation","subspace alignment","DA algorithm","eigenvectors","mapping function","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["domain adaptation","subspace alignment","object recognition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new domain adaptation (DA) algorithm where the source and target domains are represented by subspaces described by eigenvectors.

Compared with prior approximate nearest neighbor search approaches like tree-based indexing, hashing-based search schemes have prominent advantages in terms of both storage and computational efficiencies. Moreover, the procedure of devising hash functions can be easily incorporated into sophisticated machine learning tools, leading to data-dependent and task-specific compact hash codes. Therefore, a number of learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised to supervised, have been applied to compose appropriate hash functions. However, most of the existing hash function learning methods either treat hash function design as a classification problem or generate binary codes to satisfy pair wise supervision, and have not yet directly optimized the search accuracy. In this paper, we propose to leverage list wise supervision into a principled hash function learning framework. In particular, the ranking information is represented by a set of rank triplets that can be used to assess the quality of ranking. Simple linear projection-based hash functions are solved efficiently through maximizing the ranking quality over the training data. We carry out experiments on large image datasets with size up to one million and compare with the state-of-the-art hashing techniques. The extensive results corroborate that our learned hash codes via list wise supervision can provide superior search accuracy without incurring heavy computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.377","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751488.pdf","startPage":"3032","endPage":"3039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Hash Codes with Listwise Supervision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751488/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Hash Codes with Listwise Supervision","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144973","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751488/","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Hash Codes with Listwise Supervision","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100374S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751493,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Kiani Galoogahi","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hamed Kiani","lastName":"Galoogahi","id":"37990667000"},{"name":"Terence Sim","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Sim","id":"37268065900"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751493","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Detectors","Frequency-domain analysis","Training","Equations","Vectors","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","filtering theory","frequency-domain analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel correlation filters","HOG descriptor","SIFT descriptor","pattern detection","video","signal processing perspective","detection process","multichannel image","multichannel detector-filter learning","single-channel response map","frequency domain","training time","memory footprint","visual detection-localization tasks","computational efficiency","memory efficiency","computer vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi channel features","correlation filter learning","pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"Modern descriptors like HOG and SIFT are now commonly used in vision for pattern detection within image and video. From a signal processing perspective, this detection process can be efficiently posed as a correlation/ convolution between a multi-channel image and a multi-channel detector/filter which results in a single channel response map indicating where the pattern (e.g. object) has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning a multi-channel detector/filter efficiently in the frequency domain, both in terms of training time and memory footprint, which we refer to as a multichannel correlation filter. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, we evaluate it across a number of visual detection/ localization tasks where we: (i) exhibit superior performance to current state of the art correlation filters, and (ii) superior computational and memory efficiencies compared to state of the art spatial detectors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.381","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"3072","endPage":"3079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel Correlation Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel Correlation Filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751493/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144874","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751493/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel Correlation Filters","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070603S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751494,"authors":[{"name":"Honghui Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Honghui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539406300"},{"name":"Jingdong Wang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Jingdong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406478900"},{"name":"Ping Tan","affiliation":["National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085414267"},{"name":"Jinglu Wang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jinglu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085588281"},{"name":"Long Quan","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Quan","id":"37273384400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751494","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Labeling","Training data","Data models","Optimization","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","gradient methods","image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image parsing","learning CRF","adaptive subgradient descent method","parameter learning","convex optimization problem","objective constraint modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Parsing","Adaptive Subgradient Descent","Conditional Random Field"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751494","abstract":"We propose an adaptive sub gradient descent method to efficiently learn the parameters of CRF models for image parsing. To balance the learning efficiency and performance of the learned CRF models, the parameter learning is iteratively carried out by solving a convex optimization problem in each iteration, which integrates a proximal term to preserve the previously learned information and the large margin preference to distinguish bad labeling and the ground truth labeling. A solution of sub gradient descent updating form is derived for the convex optimization problem, with an adaptively determined updating step-size. Besides, to deal with partially labeled training data, we propose a new objective constraint modeling both the labeled and unlabeled parts in the partially labeled training data for the parameter learning of CRF models. The superior learning efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the experiment results on two public datasets.

Most of existing works solve this task by matching a reference template with the target individual, but often suffer from large human appearance variability (e.g. different poses/views, illumination) and high false positives in matching caused by conjunctions, occlusions or surrounding clutters. Addressing these problems, we construct a simple yet expressive template from a few reference images of a certain individual, which represents the body as an articulated assembly of compositional and alternative parts, and propose an effective matching algorithm with cluster sampling. This algorithm is designed within a candidacy graph whose vertices are matching candidates (i.e. a pair of source and target body parts), and iterates in two steps for convergence. (i) It generates possible partial matches based on compatible and competitive relations among body parts. (ii) It confirms the partial matches to generate a new matching solution, which is accepted by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on three public databases compared to existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751503/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144966","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Human Re-identification by Matching Compositional Template with Cluster Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human Re-identification by Matching Compositional Template with Cluster Sampling","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060723S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6751504,"authors":[{"name":"Tae Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085403692"},{"name":"Byeongjoo Ahn","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byeongjoo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37086785120"},{"name":"Kyoung Mu Lee","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Mu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407638800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751504","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":687},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image restoration","Motion segmentation","Data models","Cameras","Vectors","Dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","convex programming","image motion analysis","image restoration","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static scenes","convex optimization-based method","weights nonlocal regularization","data fidelity","data models","pixel-wise weights","multiple blur data models","energy model","motion blur segmentation","blur motions","general dynamic scenes","deblurring problem","camera shake","image deblurring methods","dynamic scene deblurring"]}],"abstract":"Most conventional single image deblurring methods assume that the underlying scene is static and the blur is caused by only camera shake. In this paper, in contrast to this restrictive assumption, we address the deblurring problem of general dynamic scenes which contain multiple moving objects as well as camera shake. In case of dynamic scenes, moving objects and background have different blur motions, so the segmentation of the motion blur is required for deblurring each distinct blur motion accurately. Thus, we propose a novel energy model designed with the weighted sum of multiple blur data models, which estimates different motion blurs and their associated pixel-wise weights, and resulting sharp image. In this framework, the local weights are determined adaptively and get high values when the corresponding data models have high data fidelity. And, the weight information is used for the segmentation of the motion blur. Non-local regularization of weights are also incorporated to produce more reliable segmentation results. A convex optimization-based method is used for the solution of the proposed energy model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches in deblurring both dynamic scenes and static scenes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Scene Deblurring","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.392","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751504.pdf","startPage":"3160","endPage":"3167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Scene Deblurring","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751504/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144770","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Scene Deblurring","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06734S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6751505,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com; T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086758896"},{"name":"Hichem Sahbi","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Hichem","lastName":"Sahbi","id":"37332987100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751505","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Trajectory","Feature extraction","Tensile stress","Convergence","Clustering algorithms","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","feature extraction","image coding","image motion analysis","spectral analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed acyclic graph kernels","action recognition method","mid-level feature extraction","visual encoding","motion encoding","high-level semantic actions","high level structures","DAGs","spectrum analysis","complex higher order interactions","positive semidefinite kernel","support vector machines","graph-based methods","standard evaluation dataset"]}],"abstract":"One of the trends of action recognition consists in extracting and comparing mid-level features which encode visual and motion aspects of objects into scenes. However, when scenes contain high-level semantic actions with many interacting parts, these mid-level features are not sufficient to capture high level structures as well as high order causal relationships between moving objects resulting into a clear drop in performances. In this paper, we address this issue and we propose an alternative action recognition method based on a novel graph kernel. In the main contributions of this work, we first describe actions in videos using directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs), that naturally encode pair wise interactions between moving object parts, and then we compare these DAGs by analyzing the spectrum of their sub-patterns that capture complex higher order interactions. This extraction and comparison process is computationally tractable, resulting from the a cyclic property of DAGs, and it also defines a positive semi-definite kernel. When plugging the latter into support vector machines, we obtain an action recognition algorithm that overtakes related work, including graph-based methods, on a standard evaluation dataset.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751505.pdf","startPage":"3168","endPage":"3175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directed Acyclic Graph Kernels for Action Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Directed Acyclic Graph Kernels for Action Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144905","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6751505/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directed Acyclic Graph Kernels for Action Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056689S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751508,"authors":[{"name":"Hueihan Jhuang","affiliation":["MPI for Intelligent Systems, Germany"],"firstName":"Hueihan","lastName":"Jhuang","id":"37825385900"},{"name":"Juergen Gall","affiliation":["University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Gall","id":"37393846400"},{"name":"Silvia Zuffi","affiliation":["Brown University, USA"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Zuffi","id":"37448955700"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"},{"name":"Michael J.

Many recent approaches improve accuracy and robustness to cope with challenging video sequences, but it is often unclear what affects the results most. This paper attempts to provide insights based on a systematic performance evaluation using thoroughly-annotated data of human actions. We annotate human Joints for the HMDB dataset (J-HMDB). This annotation can be used to derive ground truth optical flow and segmentation. We evaluate current methods using this dataset and systematically replace the output of various algorithms with ground truth. This enables us to discover what is important - for example, should we work on improving flow algorithms, estimating human bounding boxes, or enabling pose estimation? In summary, we find that high-level pose features greatly outperform low/mid level features, in particular, pose over time is critical, but current pose estimation algorithms are not yet reliable enough to provide this information. We also find that the accuracy of a top-performing action recognition framework can be greatly increased by refining the underlying low/mid level features, this suggests it is important to improve optical flow and human detection algorithms. Our analysis and J-HMDB dataset should facilitate a deeper understanding of action recognition algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.396","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"3192","endPage":"3199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Understanding Action Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Understanding Action Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751508/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144801","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Understanding Action Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075068S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"308","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6751510,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Plze\u0148, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Cao","id":"38467235200"},{"name":"David Wipf","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Plze\u0148, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Wipf","id":"37284995100"},{"name":"Fang Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Plze\u0148, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wen","id":"37928941600"},{"name":"Genquan Duan","firstName":"Genquan","lastName":"Duan","id":"37086792774"},{"name":"Jian Sun","firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407525400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751510","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":769},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Face","Joints","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Testing","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","convex programming","expectation-maximisation algorithm","face recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face verification","facial images","labeled training data","family album photo organization software","principled transfer learning approach","source-domain data","target-domain data","generative Bayesian model","KL-divergence-based regularizer-prior","robust likelihood function","EM algorithm","convex analysis","equivalent structured rank minimization problem","feature-transform invariance","Kullback-Leibler divergence-prior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transfer learning","face verification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751510","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.398","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","abstract":"Face verification involves determining whether a pair of facial images belongs to the same or different subjects.

To address the problem, one solution is to select the frames of `best quality' from videos (hereinafter called quality alignment in this paper). Meanwhile, the faces in the selected frames should also be geometrically aligned to the still faces offline well-aligned in the gallery. In this paper, we discover that the interactions among the three tasks-quality alignment, geometric alignment and face recognition-can benefit from each other, thus should be performed jointly. With this in mind, we propose a Coupling Alignments with Recognition (CAR) method to tightly couple these tasks via low-rank regularized sparse representation in a unified framework. Our method makes the three tasks promote mutually by a joint optimization in an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier routine.

Towards this goal, we build a hierarchical model that combines the bottom-level image features and the top-level AU relationships to jointly recognize AUs in a principled manner. The proposed model has two major advantages over existing methods. 1) Unlike methods that can only capture local pair-wise AU dependencies, our model is developed upon the restricted Boltzmann machine and therefore can exploit the global relationships among AUs. 2) Although AU relationships are influenced by many related factors such as facial expressions, these factors are generally ignored by the current methods. Our model, however, can successfully capture them to more accurately characterize the AU relationships. Efficient learning and inference algorithms of the proposed model are also developed. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modelling complex AU relationships as well as its superior AU recognition performance over existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capturing Global Semantic Relationships for Facial Action Unit Recognition","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.410","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751522.pdf","startPage":"3304","endPage":"3311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Capturing Global Semantic Relationships for Facial Action Unit Recognition","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751522/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144952","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capturing Global Semantic Relationships for Facial Action Unit Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084429S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6751532,"authors":[{"name":"Chenglong Bao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chenglong","lastName":"Bao","id":"38467244400"},{"name":"Jian-Feng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA"],"firstName":"Jian-Feng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085709345"},{"name":"Hui Ji","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Ji","id":"37398695700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751532","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751532","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Encoding","Image restoration","Minimization","Computational modeling","Sparse matrices","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","image representation","image restoration","minimisation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast sparsity based orthogonal dictionary learning","image restoration","sparse modelling","image processing","image recognition","dictionary learning methods","K-SVD method","minimization problem","dictionary atoms","sparse coding","image representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse representation","image restoration","dictionary learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.420","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","startPage":"3384","endPage":"3391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration","abstract":"In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition.

However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding.

Previous works often consider solving the problem of human pose estimation as the prerequisite of human parsing. We argue that these approaches cannot obtain optimal pixel level parsing due to the inconsistent targets between these tasks. In this paper, we propose to use Parselets as the building blocks of our parsing model. Parselets are a group of parsable segments which can generally be obtained by low-level over-segmentation algorithms and bear strong semantic meaning. We then build a Deformable Mixture Parsing Model (DMPM) for human parsing to simultaneously handle the deformation and multi-modalities of Parselets. The proposed model has two unique characteristics: (1) the possible numerous modalities of Parse let ensembles are exhibited as the ``And-Or\" structure of sub-trees, (2) to further solve the practical problem of Parselet occlusion or absence, we directly model the visibility property at some leaf nodes. The DMPM thus directly solves the problem of human parsing by searching for the best graph configuration from a pool of Parse let hypotheses without intermediate tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751535.pdf","startPage":"3408","endPage":"3415","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deformable Mixture Parsing Model with Parselets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semantics","Deformable models","Estimation","Feature extraction","Labeling","Hair"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image representation","image segmentation","pose estimation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable mixture parsing model","human parsing","human body partitioning","semantic regions","parselet representation","human pose estimation","optimal pixel level parsing","low-level over-segmentation algorithm","DMPM","parselet multimodality","parselet ensembles","and-or subtree structure","parselet occlusion","parselet absence","leaf nodes","graph configuration searching","parselet hypothesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Deformable Mixture Parsing Model with Parselets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751535/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144800","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deformable Mixture Parsing Model with Parselets","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069593S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6751545,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid Pishchulin","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Pishchulin","id":"37945345400"},{"name":"Mykhaylo Andriluka","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Andriluka","id":"37547774200"},{"name":"Peter Gehler","affiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut fur Intelligente Systeme, Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gehler"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751545","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Torso","Joints","Head","Estimation","Training","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strong appearance spatial models","expressive spatial models","human pose estimation","articulated pose estimation","spatial modelling","appearance modelling","appearance representations","body part hypotheses","flexible spatial models","image-conditioned spatial models","tree-structure spatial human body model","flexible image-conditioned spatial model","leeds sports poses","parse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human pose estimation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strong Appearance and Expressive Spatial Models for Human Pose Estimation","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","endPage":"3494","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.433","startPage":"3487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751545","abstract":"Typical approaches to articulated pose estimation combine spatial modelling of the human body with appearance modelling of body parts.

Consequently, there is little analysis of video segmentation which generalizes across subtasks, and it is not yet clear which and how video segmentation should leverage the information from the still-frames, as previously studied in image segmentation, alongside video specific information, such as temporal volume, motion and occlusion. In this work we provide such an analysis based on annotations of a large video dataset, where each video is manually segmented by multiple persons. Moreover, we introduce a new volume-based metric that includes the important aspect of temporal consistency, that can deal with segmentation hierarchies, and that reflects the tradeoff between over-segmentation and segmentation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Video Segmentation Benchmark: Annotation, Metrics and Analysis","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.438","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751550.pdf","startPage":"3527","endPage":"3534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Video Segmentation Benchmark: Annotation, Metrics and Analysis","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751550/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Video Segmentation Benchmark: Annotation, Metrics and Analysis","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073493S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6751553,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Wang","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086750057"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751553","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1557,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":4858},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Cameras","Optical imaging","Adaptive optics","Vectors","Detectors","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image matching","image representation","image sequences","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MBH","HOF","motion-based descriptors","human detector","human motion","RANSAC","dense optical flow","SURF descriptors","feature point matching","camera motion estimation","action recognition","video representation","dense trajectory"]}],"abstract":"Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video representation for action recognition and achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets. This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly improves motion-based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on four challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.441","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751553.pdf","startPage":"3551","endPage":"3558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751553/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14144890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07894S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"1557","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6751555,"authors":[{"name":"Andy J.

Given the matched (positive) and unmatched (negative) image pairs from source domain cameras, as well as unmatched (negative) image pairs which can be easily generated from target domain cameras, we propose a Domain Transfer Ranked Support Vector Machines (DTRSVM) method for re-identification under target domain cameras. To overcome the problems introduced due to the absence of matched (positive) image pairs in target domain, we relax the discriminative constraint to a necessary condition only relying on the positive mean in target domain. By estimating the target positive mean using source and target domain data, a new discriminative model with high confidence in target positive mean and low confidence in target negative image pairs is developed. Since the necessary condition may not truly preserve the discriminability, multi-task support vector ranking is proposed to incorporate the training data from source domain with label information. Experimental results show that the proposed DTRSVM outperforms existing methods without using label information in target cameras. And the top 30 rank accuracy can be improved by the proposed method upto 9.40% on publicly available person re-identification datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751555.pdf","startPage":"3567","endPage":"3574","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Transfer Support Vector Ranking for Person Re-identification without Target Camera Label Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Vectors","Mathematical model","Equations","Support vector machines","Optimization","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image matching","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain transfer support vector ranking","person re-identification problem","nonoverlapping target cameras","pairs","unmatched image pairs","domain transfer ranked support vector machines","DTRSVM method","discriminative constraint","discriminative model","discriminability","multitask support vector ranking","label information","reidentification datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person Re-Identification","Domain Adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Domain Transfer Support Vector Ranking for Person Re-identification without Target Camera Label Information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6751555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145089","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Transfer Support Vector Ranking for Person Re-identification without Target Camera Label Information","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133006S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6751560,"authors":[{"name":"Tal Hassner","affiliation":["The Open University of Israel, Israel"],"firstName":"Tal","lastName":"Hassner","id":"37393684300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2840-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"6751560","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":639},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Optimization","Estimation","Image reconstruction","Solid modeling","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","image reconstruction","optimisation","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-world face view","data-driven method","3D shape","unconstrained photos","visual features matching","optimization process","monocular face shape reconstruction","Web photos"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-view 3D reconstruction","Monocular 3D","Faces"]}],"abstract":"We present a data-driven method for estimating the 3D shapes of faces viewed in single, unconstrained photos (aka \"in-the-wild\"). Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency - with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query's 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities. Finally, as a testament to its suitability for real-world applications, we offer an open, on-line implementation of our system, providing unique means of instant 3D viewing of faces appearing in web photos.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2013.448","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel7/6750807/6751100/06751560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2013.448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751100","startPage":"3607","endPage":"3614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Viewing Real-World Faces in 3D","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Viewing Real-World Faces in 3D","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751560/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144758","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viewing Real-World Faces in 3D","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"2840d607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063062S","chronDate":"1-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6750807","isNumber":"6751100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6750807","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6751100","articleId":"6751560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6751569,"authors":[{"name":"Indra Bagus Wicaksono","affiliation":["Research Institute for Nanodevice and Bio Systems, Hiroshima University, Japan"],"firstName":"Indra Bagus","lastName":"Wicaksono","id":"38580553200"},{"name":"Fengwei An","affiliation":["HiSIM Research Center, Hiroshima University, Japan"],"firstName":"Fengwei","lastName":"An","id":"38235502500"},{"name":"Hans J\u00fcrgen Mattausch","affiliation":["Research Institute for Nanodevice and Bio Systems, Hiroshima University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hans J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Mattausch","id":"37269154600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1075-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1072-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1073-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"}],"articleNumber":"6751569","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Accuracy","Prototypes","Computer architecture","Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","content-addressable storage","field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-accelerated reduced dimensionality multiprototype learning","recognition system","complementary classifiers","real-time performance","machine learning systems","robotics","automotive domains","general purpose classifiers","hardware constraints","associative memory based architectures","high-speed computer vision applications","machine learning applications","FPGA accelerated complementary reduced dimensionality multi-prototype learning","discriminative reduced dimensionality multiprototype classifiers","general purpose support vector machine based systems"]}],"abstract":"Real-time performance is necessary for many computer vision and machine learning systems in the robotics and automotive domains. Hardware based solutions can meet the demands of real-time applications. Support Vector Machines have demonstrated to be one of the best performing general purpose classifiers, however the approach requires significant simplifications to satisfy hardware constraints. Conversely, associative memory based architectures are inherently hardware friendly and have proven to be a promising approach for high-speed computer vision and machine learning applications, but the accuracies of these systems have not been satisfactory. This paper extends the concept of hardware associative memories and reports an FPGA Accelerated Complementary Reduced Dimensionality Multi-Prototype Learning and Recognition System which is composed of discriminative Reduced Dimensionality Multi-Prototype classifiers. To test the performance, the system is applied to human detection. In addition to outperforming general purpose support vector machine based systems, the complementary approach demonstrated a combined detection time of only 14.9 \u03bcs per sample.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2013.6751569","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746885/6751567/06751569.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2013.6751569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751567","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware-Accelerated Reduced Dimensionality Multi-Prototype Learning and Recognition System with complementary classifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware-Accelerated Reduced Dimensionality Multi-Prototype Learning and Recognition System with complementary classifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6751569/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14144743","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6751569/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware-Accelerated Reduced Dimensionality Multi-Prototype Learning and Recognition System with complementary classifiers","confLoc":"Manila, Philippines","sourcePdf":"RP001c012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074748S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746885","isNumber":"6751567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746885","xplore-issue":"6751567","articleId":"6751569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6751592,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Hiong Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research(I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Chin Hiong","lastName":"Tan","id":"38183667200"},{"name":"Huajin Tang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research(I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Huajin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37274558400"},{"name":"Kay Chen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore"],"firstName":"Kay Chen","lastName":"Tan","id":"37334471700"},{"name":"Miaolong Yuan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research(I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Miaolong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085461761"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1075-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1072-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1073-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"}],"articleNumber":"6751592","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"A key functional role of the hippocampus is the formation of associative memories.

There have been wide interests in both clusters and cloud of adopting graphics processors (GPUs) as accelerators for various applications. On the other hand, large-scale graph processing is important for many data-intensive applications in the cloud. In this paper, we propose to leverage GPUs to accelerate large-scale graph processing in the cloud. Specifically, we develop an in-memory graph processing engine G2 with three non-trivial GPU-specific optimizations. Firstly, we adopt fine-grained APIs to take advantage of the massive thread parallelism of the GPU. Secondly, G2 embraces a graph partition based approach for load balancing on heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures. Thirdly, a runtime system is developed to perform transparent memory management on the GPU, and to perform scheduling for an improved throughput of concurrent kernel executions from graph tasks. We have conducted experiments on an Amazon EC2 virtual cluster of eight nodes. Our preliminary results demonstrate that 1) GPU is a viable accelerator for cloud-based graph processing, and 2) the proposed optimizations improve the performance of GPU-based graph processing engine. We further present the lessons learnt and open problems towards large-scale graph processing with GPU accelerations.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.8","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753772.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Graph Processing in the Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753772/","displayDocTitle":"Towards GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Graph Processing in the Cloud","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146191","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6753772/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Graph Processing in the Cloud","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110331S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6753775,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

However, not all data is accessed at the same time or rate. Thus, if a large replication factor is used to support higher throughput for popular data, it wastes storage by unnecessarily replicating unpopular data as well. Conversely, if less replication is used to conserve storage for the unpopular data, it means fewer replicas for even popular data and thus lower I/O throughput. We present Apt Store, a dynamic data management system for Hadoop, which aims to improve overall I/O throughput while reducing storage cost. We design a tiered storage that uses the standard DAS for popular data to sustain high I/O throughput, and network-attached enterprise filers for cost-effective, fault-tolerant, but lower-throughput storage for unpopular data. We design a file Popularity Prediction Algorithm (PPA) that analyzes file system audit logs and predicts the appropriate storage policy of each file, as well as use the information for transparent data movement between tiers. Our evaluation of Apt Store on a real cluster shows 21.3% improvement in application execution time over standard Hadoop, while trace driven simulations show 23.7% increase in read throughput and 43.4% reduction in the storage capacity requirement of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AptStore: Dynamic Storage Management for Hadoop","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.12","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753775.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"AptStore: Dynamic Storage Management for Hadoop","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6753775/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AptStore: Dynamic Storage Management for Hadoop","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064082S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6753778,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Ma","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"38237424200"},{"name":"Ke Hong","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Hong","id":"38244013900"},{"name":"Lin Gu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Gu","id":"37393438200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6753778","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Semantics","Sparks","Substrates","Cloud computing","Servers","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VOLUME","large-scale in-memory computation","commodity clusters","MapReduce","cloud computing technology","data storage","data sharing","distributed file system","global name","distributed DRAM","data center environment","physical memory","virtual on-line unified memory environment","distributed virtual memory","disk resources","system-wide data substrate","general memory based abstraction","remote servers","Hadoop-HDFS","Spark-RDD","k-means clustering","TH-1-GZ supercomputer"]}],"abstract":"Traditional cloud computing technologies, such as MapReduce, use file systems as the system-wide substrate for data storage and sharing. A distributed file system provides a global name space and stores data persistently, but it also introduces significant overhead. Several recent systems use DRAM to store data and tremendously improve the performance of cloud computing systems. However, both our own experience and related work indicate that a simple substitution of distributed DRAM for the file system does not provide a solid and viable foundation for data storage and processing in the data center environment, and the capacity of such systems is limited by the amount of physical memory in the cluster. To overcome the challenge, we construct VOLUME (Virtual On-Line Unified Memory Environment), a distributed virtual memory to unify the physical memory and disk resources on many compute nodes, to form a system-wide data substrate. The new substrate provides a general memory based abstraction, takes advantage of DRAM in the system to accelerate computation, and, transparent to programmers, scales the system to handle large datasets by swapping data to disks and remote servers. The evaluation results show that VOLUME is much faster than Hadoop/HDFS, and delivers 6-11x speedups on the adjacency list workload. VOLUME is faster than both Hadoop/HDFS and Spark/RDD for in-memory sorting. For kmeans clustering, VOLUME scales linearly to 160 compute nodes on the TH-1/GZ supercomputer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VOLUME: Enable Large-Scale In-Memory Computation on Commodity Clusters","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753778.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"VOLUME: Enable Large-Scale In-Memory Computation on Commodity Clusters","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6753778/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146245","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VOLUME: Enable Large-Scale In-Memory Computation on Commodity Clusters","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097293S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6753805,"authors":[{"name":"Vasiliki Kalavri","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Vasiliki","lastName":"Kalavri","id":"37086332199"},{"name":"Vaidas Brundza","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Vaidas","lastName":"Brundza","id":"37086739020"},{"name":"Vladimir Vlassov","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Vlassov","id":"37354585500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6753805","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Estimation","Meteorology","Approximation methods","Temperature measurement","Data processing","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absolute error","average temperature estimation","minimal overhead","HOP accuracy improvement","data bias reduction","in-memory shuffling","HDFS block sampling technique","input subset","progress metrics","Hadoop Online Prototype","job completion","partial-job execution","response time","data analysis","Hadoop MapReduce","large-scale data processing frameworks","online aggregation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","online aggregation","sampling","approximate results"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753805","abstract":"Large-scale data processing frameworks, such as Hadoop MapReduce, are widely used to analyze enormous amounts of data. However, processing is often time-consuming, preventing interactive analysis. One way to decrease response time is partial job execution, where an approximate, early result becomes available to the user, prior to job completion. The Hadoop Online Prototype (HOP) uses online aggregation to provide early results, by partially executing jobs on subsets of the input, using a simplistic progress metric. Due to its sequential nature, values are not objectively represented in the input subset, often resulting in poor approximations or \"data bias\". In this paper, we propose a block sampling technique for large-scale data processing, which can be used for fast and accurate partial job execution. Our implementation of the technique on top of HOP uniformly samples HDFS blocks and uses in-memory shuffling to reduce data bias. Our prototype significantly improves the accuracy of HOP's early results, while only introducing minimal overhead. We evaluate our technique using real-world datasets and applications and demonstrate that our system outperforms HOP in terms of accuracy. In particular, when estimating the average temperature of the studied dataset, our system provides high accuracy (less than 20% absolute error) after processing only 10% of the input, while HOP needs to process 70% of the input to yield comparable results.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.40","startPage":"250","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Sampling: Efficient Accurate Online Aggregation in MapReduce","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Block Sampling: Efficient Accurate Online Aggregation in MapReduce","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6753805/","accessionNumber":"14146199","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753805/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Sampling: Efficient Accurate Online Aggregation in MapReduce","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059534S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6753815,"authors":[{"name":"Abderrahmen Mtibaa","affiliation":["ECEN Department, Texas A&M University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Abderrahmen","lastName":"Mtibaa","id":"37409642600"},{"name":"Khaled A.

In this paper, we consider environments in which computational offloading occurs amongst a set of mobile devices. We call such an environment a mobile device cloud (MDC). In this work, we first highlight the gain in computation time and energy consumption that can be achieved by offloading tasks to nearby devices within an MDC compared to a cloud. We then propose and implement an MDC platform that enables the creation and assessment of various offloading algorithms in MDCs. This platform consists of an Android application deployable across MDC devices, and a test bed to measure power being consumed by a mobile device. We utilize this platform to carry out various offloading experiments on an MDC test bed from which we gain interesting insights into the potential for MDC offloading. Results from these experiments show up to 50% gain in time and 26% gain in energy. Finally, we address the off loadee selection problem in MDCs by proposing several social-based algorithms. The potential promise of this approach is shown by evaluating these algorithms using real data sets that include contact traces and social information of mobile devices in a conference setting.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753815.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Computational Offloading in Mobile Device Clouds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Performance evaluation","Bluetooth","Cloud computing","Emulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","cloud computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contact traces","mobile devices","social-based algorithms","Android application","MDC platform","mobile device clouds","computational offloading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Device Cloud","Computation Offloading","Opportunistic Communication","Opportunistic Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards Computational Offloading in Mobile Device Clouds","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6753815/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146239","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Computational Offloading in Mobile Device Clouds","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049969S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6753820,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Jamkhedkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Jamkhedkar","id":"37689204600"},{"name":"Jakub Szefer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Szefer","id":"37545420200"},{"name":"Diego Perez-Botero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Perez-Botero","id":"38277577600"},{"name":"Tianwei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tianwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38560530600"},{"name":"Gina Triolo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gina","lastName":"Triolo","id":"37086794467"},{"name":"Ruby B.

However, for the case that the pictures are used as an evidence of court trial, we made the privacy protection to be conditional and thus can be revoked by authorized entity(s) if necessary.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753829.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Witnesses as a Service: Leveraging Vehicles as Witnesses on the Road in VANET Clouds","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.64","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Witnesses as a Service: Leveraging Vehicles as Witnesses on the Road in VANET Clouds","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6753829/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Witnesses as a Service: Leveraging Vehicles as Witnesses on the Road in VANET Clouds","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077721S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6753838,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Chang","affiliation":["School of Computing Creative Technologies and Engineering, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Chang","id":"37529748200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6753838","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Brain","Educational institutions","Medical services","Standards","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","brain","cloud computing","data analysis","data visualisation","health care","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cloud APIs","data analysis","data visualization","medical cloud computing education","MCCE","cloud brain segmentation technology","healthcare informatics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Healthcare Cloud","brain segmentation technology by Cloud Computing","Medical Cloud Computing Education"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces the brain segmentation technology offered by Cloud Computing. It explains eleven APIs associated with each brain segment, as well as the process of capturing data in regard to each segment. Functionality and experiments associated with each API are discussed. Dancing is chosen because data related to fast and skilled movements can be captured more easily. The results captured for each brain segment are discussed and used to explain why some segments are more active in dancing. With an emphasis in testing to ensure a high quality of data analysis and visualization, eleven Cloud APIs can produce results quickly, accurately and effectively. Simulations for brain segmentations can be used by Medical Cloud Computing Education (MCCE). Results of analysis confirms that Cloud Computing can offer 20% improvement in learning satisfaction. Benefits of using Cloud brain segmentation technology are presented. The use of Cloud Computing can make positive impacts to healthcare informatics and education.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.110","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753838.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing for Brain Segmentation Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing for Brain Segmentation Technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753838/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146216","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6753838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing for Brain Segmentation Technology","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057323S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6753850,"authors":[{"name":"Mateusz Guzek","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Guzek","id":"37547606300"},{"name":"Dzmitry Kliazovich","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Kliazovich","id":"37283713000"},{"name":"Pascal Bouvry","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bouvry","id":"37282633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6753850","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Servers","Vectors","Resource management","Data models","Computer architecture","Green products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation","software management","software performance evaluation","software reliability","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource representation","virtualized cloud computing data centers","cloud infrastructure management","cloud infrastructure optimization","performance","reliability","energy consumption","security","virtual machine allocation","task allocation","computing representation","memory representation","storage representation","communication resource representation","physical servers","GreenCloud simulator"]}],"abstract":"Management and optimization of cloud infrastructures combine multiple challenges.

Moreover, mobile cloud computing (MCC) is widely focused, as they can greatly alleviate the hardware limit of mobile devices as well as enable a lot of new mobile applications. All these make the integration of WSNs and MCC a very hot research topic. In this paper, we first observe a context non-awareness issue between mobile user and WSNs, which affects the mobile user obtaining the desirable data when integrating WSNs and MCC. Then focusing on solving the context non-awareness issue to provide desirable data to mobile users, we propose a novel framework for integrating WSNs and MCC. The proposed framework performs data recommendation, data prediction as well as data traffic monitoring in the cloud to obtain the data feature information required by the mobile users and potential status of WSNs. Then these user data feature information and potential WSNs status information are utilized to optimize the deployment of WSNs and check the status of WSNs. This could in turn offer the desirable data to the mobile users. Extensive evaluations also validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.86","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","startPage":"607","endPage":"614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Desirable Data to Users When Integrating Wireless Sensor Networks with Mobile Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Providing Desirable Data to Users When Integrating Wireless Sensor Networks with Mobile Cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753852/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146249","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6753852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing Desirable Data to Users When Integrating Wireless Sensor Networks with Mobile Cloud","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120592S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6753860,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Barouti","affiliation":["Computer Security Lab Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Samira","lastName":"Barouti","id":"37085511197"},{"name":"Dima Alhadidi","affiliation":["College of Technological Innovation Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Dima","lastName":"Alhadidi","id":"37317981200"},{"name":"Mourad Debbabi","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information System Engineering, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Debbabi","id":"37296103600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6753860","dbTime":"57 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Protocols","Databases","Payloads","Encryption","Data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","cloud computing","data privacy","database management systems","outsourcing","protocols","query processing","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetrically-private database search","database-as-a-service","database outsourcing","cloud computing services","cloud server","protocols","keyword search","SQL queries","client privacy requirements","database owner privacy requirements","symmetric private information retrieval","private integer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Private Information Retieval","Privacy Enhancing Technology"]}],"abstract":"Database outsourcing has gained importance in the past few years due to the emergence of the cloud computing. In Database-as-a-Service (DaaS), which is a category of cloud computing services, the database owner outsources both databases and querying services to a cloud server and clients issue queries over the database to the cloud server. In this context, privacy is a primary challenge and it is necessary to fulfill main privacy requirements of database owners and clients. This paper presents protocols for executing keyword search and aggregate SQL queries that preserve the privacy of both the client and the database owner. Client privacy is preserved such that the database owner and the cloud server cannot infer the constants contained in the query predicates. Database owner privacy is preserved such that the client cannot obtain any additional information beyond the query result. The primitives that are utilized in designing these protocols include symmetric private information retrieval and private integer comparison. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed protocols and report on the experimental results.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6734838/6735455/06753860.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetrically-Private Database Search in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2013.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6735455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2013.95","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Symmetrically-Private Database Search in Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146174","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6753860/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetrically-Private Database Search in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"5095a671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082925S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6734838","isNumber":"6735455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6734838","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6735455","articleId":"6753860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6753866,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Costa Silva","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Gabriel Costa","lastName":"Silva","id":"37085730597"},{"name":"Louis M.

This lack of portability is caused, in part, by vendor lock-in: the strong dependency created between a cloud user and a cloud provider since the cloud user deploys their software on a specific cloud platform. This paper outlines our plans to address vendor lock-in by applying techniques from the area of model-driven engineering (MDE), a contemporary and principled approach to software engineering that has sometimes been used to achieve greater portability of software.

Sky Net combines multiple techniques already developed individually in the literature to create an efficient and robust machine-learning tool that is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks for use in a wide range of learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sky Net uses a powerful `pre-training' method, to obtain a set of network parameters close to the true global maximum of the training objective function, followed by further optimisation using an automatically-regularised variant of Newton's method that uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimise using standard back propagation techniques. The blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference (BAMBI) algorithm implements the MultiNest package for nested sampling as well as the training of an artificial neural network by Sky Net to learn the likelihood function. In the case of computationally expensive likelihoods, this allows the substitution of a much more rapid approximation in order to increase significantly the speed of the analysis. Astrophysical examples are provided for both Sky Net and BAMBI.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2013.82","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732242/6753870/06753898.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2013.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6753870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Networks for Astronomical Data Analysis and Bayesian Inference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Training data","Approximation methods","Bayes methods","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomy computing","Bayes methods","data analysis","Hessian matrices","inference mechanisms","neural nets","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical data analysis","neural network training algorithm","Sky Net","BAMBI","machine-learning tool","feed-forward neural networks","training objective function","Newton method","second-order derivative information","Hessian matrix","fast approximate method","Hessian-vector products","blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference algorithm","MultiNest package"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks for Astronomical Data Analysis and Bayesian Inference","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6753898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146042","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks for Astronomical Data Analysis and Bayesian Inference","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3143a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089429S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732242","isNumber":"6753870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732242","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6753870","articleId":"6753898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6753954,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Porshnev","affiliation":["National Research University Higher School of Economics Nizhniy, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Porshnev","id":"37086727646"},{"name":"Ilya Redkin","affiliation":["National Research University Higher School of Economics Nizhniy, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Redkin","id":"37086726330"},{"name":"Alexey Shevchenko","affiliation":["National Research University Higher School of Economics Nizhniy, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Shevchenko","id":"37086726286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3142-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3143-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"6753954","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2726},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning in Prediction of Stock Market Indicators Based on Historical Data and Data from Twitter Sentiment Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732242/6753870/06753954.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2013.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6753870","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2013.111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Twitter","Accuracy","Stock markets","Algorithm design and analysis","Prediction algorithms","Support vector machines","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","social networking (online)","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","stock market indicators","historical data","Twitter sentiment analysis","linguistic technologies","social media","psychological states","market indicators","Twitter users","lexicon based approach","support vectors machine","neural networks algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prediction","stock market indicators","mood","Twitter","psychological states","Support Vectors Machine","Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753954","abstract":"Development of linguistic technologies and penetration of social media provide powerful possibilities to investigate users' moods and psychological states of people.

In this work, we regard query by humming as a subsequence similarity match problem and exploit the modified SPRING algorithm instead of DTW as the core match method to compare the melody feature extracted from polyphonic music. The SPRING algorithm reduces the algorithm complexity of subsequence match dramatically. Furthermore, we also make it possible for our system to achieve a high speedup over the serial version on different GPU platforms. Experimental results show that our system has more advantages over the state of the art subsequence match method, and has a good scalability to massive database. The processing capacity can reach to thousands of sequences match per second under down sampling. At the same time, the retrieval accuracy results related to all aspects of query by humming point out the encountered problems and the future direction.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2013.104","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732242/6753870/06753982.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2013.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6753870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Query by Humming Using Modified SPRING Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6753982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6753982/","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Query by Humming Using Modified SPRING Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6753982/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated Query by Humming Using Modified SPRING Algorithm","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3143a654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077104S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732242","isNumber":"6753870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732242","xplore-issue":"6753870","articleId":"6753982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6754004,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoguang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085460713"},{"name":"Xuan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085475759"},{"name":"Nathalie Japkowicz","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Japkowicz","id":"37561699700"},{"name":"Stan Matwin","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Matwin","id":"37352512000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3142-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3143-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"6754004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Training","Sampling methods","Data mining","Educational institutions","Sonar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imbalanced multi-instance learning method","multi-instance data classification","imbalanced class distribution","data mining","multi-instance class imbalanced datasets","multi-instance data sampling methods","multi-instance cost-sensitive boosting technique","benchmark datasets","application datasets","resampling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-instance learning","Class Imbalance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754004","abstract":"Multi-instance learning uses a set of bags containing many instances, which makes it different from standard propositional classification. Our research shows that, similar to the single-instance imbalance problem, classification of multi-instance data with imbalanced class distributions significantly degrades performance when compared to most standard multi-instance algorithms in a balanced setting. Due to the inherent differences between multi-instance and single-instance learning, the existing solutions for single-instance class imbalance problems do not transfer directly to multi-instance datasets. This is a drawback, as imbalanced multi-instance problems often occur in data mining practice. In this paper, we propose two solution frameworks for multi-instance class imbalanced datasets. In the first we explore multi-instance data sampling methods, and in the second we present a novel generalized version of a multi-instance cost-sensitive boosting technique. Experimental results, on benchmark datasets and application datasets, show that the proposed frameworks are an effective solution for the multi-instance class imbalance problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2013.85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2013.85","startPage":"808","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732242/6753870/06754004.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6753870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resampling and Cost-Sensitive Methods for Imbalanced Multi-instance Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Resampling and Cost-Sensitive Methods for Imbalanced Multi-instance Learning","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754004/","accessionNumber":"14146105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754004/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resampling and Cost-Sensitive Methods for Imbalanced Multi-instance Learning","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3143a808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093327S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732242","isNumber":"6753870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732242","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6753870","articleId":"6754004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6754007,"authors":[{"name":"Liyue Fan","affiliation":["Dept.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for anomaly detection with differential privacy. Real-time private user data can be aggregated and perturbed to guarantee privacy, while the posterior estimate is released continuously for anomaly detection tasks. Our framework is not limited to any specific application domains. We illustrate the sensitivity analysis and evaluate our framework in the context of syndrome surveillance.

This allows the collection of large amounts of person-specific mobility data that offer remarkable opportunities for data analysis. Yet, the sharing of such data poses significant privacy risks. This enunciates the need for privacy-preserving, trajectory data publishing methods. Existing approaches are either limited in their privacy specification component or they incur significant, and often unnecessary, data distortion. In response, we propose a novel framework for anonymizing trajectory data that prevents the disclosure of both identity and sensitive location information, while retaining data utility. Our framework involves: (i) selecting similar trajectories, by employing Z-ordering or data projections on frequent sub trajectories, (ii) organizing the selected trajectories into carefully constructed clusters, and (ii) anonymizing each cluster separately. We develop algorithms to realize our framework, which are effective and efficient, as verified by extensive experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754012/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754012/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14146044","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Select-Organize-Anonymize: A Framework for Trajectory Data Anonymization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Select-Organize-Anonymize: A Framework for Trajectory Data Anonymization","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3143a867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096328S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732242","isNumber":"6753870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732242","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6753870","articleId":"6754012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6754017,"authors":[{"name":"Hanen Ameur","affiliation":["Sfax-Tunisia Technopole of Sfax, MIRACL-Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hanen","lastName":"Ameur","id":"37086349416"},{"name":"Salma Jamoussi","affiliation":["Sfax-Tunisia Technopole of Sfax, MIRACL-Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salma","lastName":"Jamoussi","id":"37320306700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3142-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3143-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"6754017","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Semantics","Facebook","Pragmatics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","dictionaries","linguistics","natural language processing","social networking (online)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic dictionary construction","sentiment classification","social networks","sentimental orientation determination","Facebook comment","comment positive polarity prediction","comment negative polarity prediction","linguistic approach","sentiment analysis applications","sentiment lexicon","sentiment words","positive dictionaries","negative dictionaries","emotions symbols","emoticons","acronyms","exclamation words","enrichment step"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sentiment classication","Linguistic approach","Facebook comment","Emoticons"]}],"abstract":"The sentiment classification is one of the new challenges emerged with the advence of social networks. Our purpose is to determine the sentimental orientation of a Facebook comment (positive or negative) by using the linguistic approach. In most of the sentiment analysis applications using this approach, the sentiment lexicon plays a key role. Thus, it is very important to create a lexicon covering several sentiment words. For this reason, we address in this paper the problem how to group and list words present in the corpus into two dictionaries. We proposed a new automatic technique to create the positive and negative dictionaries that exploits the emotions symbols (emoticons, acronyms and exclamation words) present in comments. More importantly, our idea allows to enlarge these dictionaries with an enrichment step. Finally, by using these prepared dictionaries, we predict the positive and negative polarities of the comment. We evaluate our approach by comparison to human classification. Our results are also effective and consistent.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2013.34","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732242/6753870/06754017.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2013.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6753870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Construction of Dictionaries for Sentiment Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754017/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Construction of Dictionaries for Sentiment Classification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754017/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Construction of Dictionaries for Sentiment Classification","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3143a896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052557S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732242","isNumber":"6753870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732242","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6753870","articleId":"6754017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6754114,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym A.

In effect, a new class of large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems has recently emerged and attracted both scientific and industrial attention. To analyze these systems in realistic scenarios one has to include such aspects as co-channel interference, multiple access and spatial correlation. In this paper, we study the properties of correlated MIMO multiple-access channels in the presence of external interference. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we derive the ergodic sum-rate of the communication for arbitrary signal constellations when the numbers of antennas at both ends of the channel grow large. Based on these asymptotic expressions, we also address the problem of sum-rate maximization using statistical channel state information and linear precoding. The numerical results demonstrate that when the interfering terminals use discrete constellations, the resulting interference becomes easier to handle compared to Gaussian signals. Thus, it may be possible to accommodate more interfering transmitter-receiver pairs within the same area as compared to the case of Gaussian signals. In addition, we demonstrate numerically for the Gaussian and QPSK signaling schemes that it is possible to design precoder matrices that significantly improve the achievable rates at low-to-mid range of signal-to-noise ratios when compared to isotropic precoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-System Analysis of Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Arbitrary Signaling in the Presence of Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022614.130860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06754114.pdf","startPage":"2060","endPage":"2073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022614.130860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Large-System Analysis of Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Arbitrary Signaling in the Presence of Interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6754114/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252183","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-System Analysis of Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Arbitrary Signaling in the Presence of Interference","sourcePdf":"2060-tw1404-girnyk.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184769S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6754114","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6754116,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6754116/6754116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngmin Jeong (S'09) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in Electronics and Radio Engineering from Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

The spatial randomness of communicating nodes in a wireless network is one of inevitable uncertainties in the design and analysis of network information flow and connectivity. The use of multiple antennas at both transmitting and receiving nodes is the most promising strategy to increase spectral efficiency and communication reliability as well as to enhance physical-layer confidentiality of wireless systems. In this paper, we characterize multicasting in such a stochastic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network where a probe transmitter broadcasts confidential data with sectorized transmission to legitimate receivers sitting in a region R. We first put forth a measure of the total amount of information flow, called the space-time capacity, into R in a spatial random field of legitimate receivers without accounting for intrinsic confidentiality at the physical layer. We then derive the space-time capacity into the sectoral region R and the nth nearest ergodic capacity in a Poisson field to characterize the spatial average and ordering of MIMO ergodic capacity achieved by legitimate receivers in R. Using the Mar\\u{c}enko-Pastur law, we further assess the asymptotic space-time capacity and the nth nearest ergodic capacity per receive antenna as the antenna numbers tend to infinity. In the presence of eavesdropping, we determine a total amount of confidential information flow per receive antenna, called the space-time secrecy rate, into R in Poisson fields of receiving equivalents-with asymptotic arguments. Using an asymptotic secrecy graph on R, we also characterize local confidential connectivity such as the secrecy range, out-degree, and out-isolation probability of the probe transmitter. The framework developed in this work enables us to quantify the local information flow in random MIMO wireless networks by averaging first small-scale fading processes over time and then large-scale path losses over space.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06754116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022214.121108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022214.121108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicasting in Stochastic MIMO Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO","Transmitters","Multicast communication","Wireless networks","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","graph theory","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multicast communication","multimedia communication","probability","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","receiving antennas","stochastic processes","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer multicast transmission","stochastic MIMO networks","information message delivery","wireless systems","multimedia mobile applications","multimedia broadcast multicast services","spatial communicating node randomness","network information flow analysis","network connectivity analysis","multiple antennas","transmitting nodes","receiving nodes","increase spectral efficiency","increase communication reliability","physical-layer confidentiality enhancement","stochastic multiple-input multiple-output network","confidential data broadcasting","asymptotic space-time capacity assessment","spatial random field","legitimate receivers","nth nearest ergodic capacity","Poisson field","MIMO ergodic capacity","Marcenko-Pastur law","confidential information flow","space-time secrecy rate","asymptotic arguments","asymptotic secrecy graph","local confidential connectivity characterization","probe transmitter secrecy range","probe transmitter out-degree","probe transmitter out-isolation probability","random MIMO wireless networks","small-scale fading processes","large-scale path losses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast","confidential connectivity","ergodic capacity","multicast","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","physical-layer security","Poisson network","random matrix theory","secrecy rate","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multicasting in Stochastic MIMO Networks","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6754116/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252179","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicasting in Stochastic MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"1729-tw1404-jeong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.196404S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6754116","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6754117,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyue Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6754117/6754117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongyue Xue (S'11) received his B.S. degree in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, in 2013.

This form of diversity has become a fundamental technique for achieving spatial diversity by exploiting the presence of idle users in the network. This has led to new challenges in terms of designing new protocols and detectors for cooperative communications. Among various amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols, the half duplex non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) protocol is superior to other AF schemes in terms of error performance and capacity. However, this superiority is achieved at the cost of higher receiver complexity. Furthermore, in order to exploit the full diversity of the system an optimal precoder is required. In this paper, an optimal joint linear transceiver is proposed for the NAF protocol. This transceiver operates on the principles of minimum bit error rate (BER), and is referred as joint bit error rate (JBER) detector. The BER performance of JBER detector is superior to all the proposed linear detectors such as channel inversion, the maximal ratio combining, the biased maximum likelihood detectors, and the minimum mean square error. The proposed transceiver also outperforms previous precoders designed for the NAF protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.130369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.130369","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1853","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06754118.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design for Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Protocol Using a Bit Error Rate Criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design for Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Protocol Using a Bit Error Rate Criterion","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754118/","accessionNumber":"14252143","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754118/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Transceiver Design for Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Protocol Using a Bit Error Rate Criterion","sourcePdf":"1844-tw1404-qasim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076077S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6754118","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6754119,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Electronic, Computer Engineering Newcastle University, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6754119/6754119-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S'03-M'05) received his B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2000, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2005.

All nodes are equipped with multiple antennas, and we study the impact of antenna selection on such a secure communication scenario. Three transmission schemes with different tradeoff between secure performance and complexity are investigated respectively. Particularly, when antenna selection is implemented at the relay and no artificial noise is introduced, the condition to realize secure transmissions is established. Then by allowing the sources to inject artificial noise into the system, the secure performance is evaluated by focusing on different eavesdropping strategies. When both the relay and the sources send artificial noise, a low complexity strategy of antenna selection is proposed to efficiently utilize the antennas at the sources and the relay. The developed asymptotic results demonstrate that, by adding more artificial noise and performing joint antenna selection, a better secure performance, such as a larger secrecy rate and a lower outage probability, can be realized at a price of imposing more complexity on the system. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022714131252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022714131252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06754119.pdf","startPage":"2189","endPage":"2203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Studies for the Impact of Antenna Selection on Secure Two-Way Relaying Communications with Artificial Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Studies for the Impact of Antenna Selection on Secure Two-Way Relaying Communications with Artificial Noise","volume":"13","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754119/","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252186","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754119/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Studies for the Impact of Antenna Selection on Secure Two-Way Relaying Communications with Artificial Noise","sourcePdf":"2189-tw1404-ding.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104362S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6754119","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6754121,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Aerts","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6754121/6754121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nico Aerts (S'09) was born in Lier, Belgium in 1985.

A recent and promising technique, which does not increase hardware demands, is cooperative communication. Here spatial diversity is created by using other terminals to relay the information from the source terminal to the destination terminal. Cooperative protocols proposed in literature are often studied under the simplifying assumption that all channel state information is available at the destination. This contrasts to a practical scenario where channel estimates need to be derived from the broadcasted signals. In this paper, we focus on the Amplify-and-Forward protocol and use the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm to estimate the channel gain and noise variance in an iterative way, exploiting both the pilot part and the data part of the signal received at the destination. We consider a relay that performs a general affine transformation on the pilot symbols received by the source, and we optimize this transformation in terms of estimation accuracy. The resulting mean square error performance is shown to be close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative SAGE-Based Channel Estimation in a Block Fading Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022714.120323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06754121.pdf","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022714.120323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Iterative SAGE-Based Channel Estimation in a Block Fading Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6754121/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative SAGE-Based Channel Estimation in a Block Fading Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Network","sourcePdf":"1742-tw1404-aerts.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10032S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6754121","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6754124,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyu Huang","affiliation":["Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221039/6728726/6754124/6754124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiyu Huang (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2008.

implement a suitable controller for a three-phase dc-ac multilevel active-clamped converter to enable its use in practice, and as a first step toward a full closed-loop converter control implementation into a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device, this paper presents the structure and features of an FPGA implementation of an appropriate pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategy. The selected PWM strategy guarantees dc-link capacitor voltage balance in every switching cycle, and covers both the undermodulation and overmodulation regions. A flexible implementation is conceived, allowing the variation of important operating parameters, such as the modulation index and switching frequency, through a simple user interface. The key aspects to achieve an efficient and robust FPGA implementation are discussed. Experimental results in a four-level converter prototype controlled with an Altera Cyclone III device under different operating conditions match fairly well with the expected results obtained through simulation, thus verifying the accurate performance of the FPGA-based modulator.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2309483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06754130.pdf","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2309483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a PWM for a Three-Phase DC\u2013AC Multilevel Active-Clamped Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754130/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a PWM for a Three-Phase DC\u2013AC Multilevel Active-Clamped Converter","volume":"10","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754130/","publicationDate":"May 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267637","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of a PWM for a Three-Phase DC\u2013AC Multilevel Active-Clamped Converter","sourcePdf":"tii-busquetsmonge-2309483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067012S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6754130","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6754132,"authors":[{"name":"Deyong You","affiliation":["School of Electromechanical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Deyong","lastName":"You","id":"38248157200"},{"name":"Xiangdong Gao","affiliation":["School of Electromechanical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37308899700"},{"name":"Seiji Katayama","affiliation":["Joining and Welding Research Institute, Osaka University, Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiji","lastName":"Katayama","id":"37265651800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-3203"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0050"}],"articleNumber":"6754132","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1213},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-smc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Monitoring","Photodiodes","Optical filters","Cameras","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feature extraction","fracture","inspection","laser beam welding","photodiodes","production engineering computing","productivity","sensor fusion","support vector machines","ultraviolet detectors","welds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["productivity","industrial manufacturing","multisensor fusion system","support vector machine","weld defects monitoring","weld defects identification","high-power disk laser welding","sensing technologies","photodiode sensing","visible light radiation monitoring","laser focus position","ultraviolet and visible sensing","UVV sensing","plume","molten pool","visual sensing","auxiliary illumination","dynamic behavior monitoring","keyhole","time domains","frequency domains","feature extraction","eigenvector","SVM classification","laser welding process","defects inspection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data acquisition","defect inspection","laser welding","monitoring","multisensing","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"abstract":"In order to optimize the productivity of industrial manufacturing, a multisensor fusion system based on support vector machine (SVM) was researched to monitor and identify weld defects during high-power disk laser welding.

This paper is motivated by semiconductor manufacturing, where the floor space is highly expensive (such as in a cleanroom environment) but there is also considerable material handling amongst machines. This is an integrated optimization task that considers both material movement and manufacturing area. Specifically, a new approach combining multiobjective tabu search with linear programming is proposed for an extended double row layout problem, in which the objective is to determine exact locations of machines in both rows to minimize material handling cost and layout area where material flows are asymmetric. First, a formulation of this layout problem is established. Second, an optimization framework is proposed that utilizes multiobjective tabu search and linear programming to determine a set of non-dominated solutions, which includes both sequences and positions of machines. This framework is applied to various manufacturing situations, and compared with an exact approach and a popular multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to obtain sets of Pareto solutions that are far better than those obtained by the alternative approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

been shown to be a viable alternative to static random access memory in low-power applications due to their low leakage currents and high density. The primary component of power consumption in these arrays is the dynamic power consumed during periodic refresh operations. Refresh timing is traditionally set according to a worst-case evaluation of retention time under extreme process variations, and worst-case access statistics, leading to frequent power-hungry refresh cycles. In this brief we present a replica technique for automatically tracking the retention time of a gain-cell-embedded dynamic-random-access-memory macrocell according to process variations and operating statistics, thereby reducing the data retention power of the array. A 2-kb array was designed and fabricated in a mature 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process, appropriate for integration in ultralow power applications, such as biomedical sensors. Measurements show efficient retention time tracking across a range of supply voltages and access statistics, lowering the refresh frequency by more than 5\u00d7, as compared with traditional worst-case design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"61","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14239364","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6754136/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Replica Technique for Adaptive Refresh Timing of Gain-Cell-Embedded DRAM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","grantNumber":"PP002-119057"},{"fundingName":"Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"Intel Ph.D. fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replica Technique for Adaptive Refresh Timing of Gain-Cell-Embedded DRAM","sourcePdf":"tcsii-teman-2305016-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062417S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6798683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6798683","articleId":"6754136","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6754140,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos M.

The goal of reference intercalibration, as established in the Decadal Survey, is to enable rigorous high-accuracy observations of critical climate change parameters, including reflected broadband radiation [Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)], cloud properties [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)], and changes in surface albedo, including snow and ice albedo feedback. In this paper, we describe the CLARREO approach for performing intercalibration on orbit in the reflected solar (RS) wavelength domain. It is based on providing highly accurate spectral reflectance and reflected radiance measurements from the CLARREO Reflected Solar Spectrometer (RSS) to establish an on-orbit reference for existing sensors, namely, CERES and VIIRS on Joint Polar Satellite System satellites, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and follow-on imagers on MetOp, Landsat imagers, and imagers on geostationary platforms. One of two fundamental CLARREO mission goals is to provide sufficient sampling of high-accuracy observations that are matched in time, space, and viewing angles with measurements made by existing instruments, to a degree that overcomes the random error sources from imperfect data matching and instrument noise. The data matching is achieved through CLARREO RSS pointing operations on orbit that align its line of sight with the intercalibrated sensor. These operations must be planned in advance; therefore, intercalibration events must be predicted by orbital modeling. If two competing opportunities are identified, one target sensor must be given priority over the other. The intercalibration method is to monitor changes in targeted sensor response function parameters: effective offset, gain, nonlinearity, optics spectral response, and sensitivity to polarization. In this paper, we use existing satellite data and orbital simulation methods to determine mission requirements for CLARREO, its instrument pointing ability, methodology, and needed intercalibration sampling and data matching for accurate intercalibration of RS radiation sensors on orbit. We conclude that with the CLARREO RSS in a polar 90\u00b0 inclination orbit at a 609-km altitude, estimated intercalibration sampling will limit the uncertainty contribution from data matching noise to 0.3% (k = 2) over the climate autocorrelation time period. The developed orbital modeling and intercalibration event prediction will serve as a framework for future mission operations.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2302397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2302397","startPage":"6762","endPage":"6774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06754140.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLARREO Approach for Reference Intercalibration of Reflected Solar Sensors: On-Orbit Data Matching and Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"CLARREO Approach for Reference Intercalibration of Reflected Solar Sensors: On-Orbit Data Matching and Sampling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","volume":"52","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754140/","accessionNumber":"14331716","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754140/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NASA CLARREO project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLARREO Approach for Reference Intercalibration of Reflected Solar Sensors: On-Orbit Data Matching and Sampling","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lukashin-2302397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102689S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6754140","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6754152,"authors":[{"name":"Rog\u00e9rio Richa","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rog\u00e9rio","lastName":"Richa","id":"37542762100"},{"name":"Rodrigo Linhares","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Linhares","id":"37085849209"},{"name":"Eros Comunello","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eros","lastName":"Comunello","id":"37326175900"},{"name":"Aldo von Wangenheim","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"von Wangenheim","id":"37276084600"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Schnitzler","affiliation":["Quantel Medical, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Schnitzler","id":"37088709840"},{"name":"Benjamin Wassmer","affiliation":["Quantel Medical, France"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Wassmer","id":"37946501400"},{"name":"Claire Guillemot","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology, CHU, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Guillemot","id":"37088706671"},{"name":"Gilles Thuret","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology, CHU, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Thuret","id":"37088708092"},{"name":"Philippe Gain","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology, CHU, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Gain","id":"37088710673"},{"name":"Gregory Hager","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Hager","id":"37276163200"},{"name":"Russell Taylor","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37277162900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"6754152","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":855},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"Laser photocoagulation is currently the standard treatment for sight-threatening diseases worldwide, namely diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusions. The slit lamp biomicroscope is the most commonly used device for this procedure, specially for the treatment of the eye periphery. However, only a small portion of the retina can be visualized through the biomicroscope, complicating the task of localizing and identifying surgical targets, increasing treatment duration and patient discomfort. In order to assist surgeons, we propose a method for creating intraoperative retina maps for view expansion using a slit-lamp device. Based on the mosaicking method described by Richa et al., 2012, the proposed method is a combination of direct and feature-based methods, suitable for the textured nature of the human retina. In this paper, we describe three major enhancements to the original formulation. The first is a visual tracking method using local illumination compensation to cope with the challenging visualization conditions. The second is an efficient pixel selection scheme for increased computational efficiency. The third is an entropy-based mosaic update method to dynamically improve the retina map during exploration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments on human subjects with a computer-assisted slit-lamp prototype. We also demonstrate the practical value of the system for photo documentation, diagnosis and intraoperative navigation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Although power system stabilizers (PSSs) have been proved to be effective in damping inner-area oscillation, inter-area oscillation still remains a critical challenge in today's power systems. Since the low-frequency oscillation between two connected power systems is active power oscillation, power modulation through energy storage devices (ESDs) can be an efficient and effective way to maintain such power system stability. In this paper, we investigate the integration of a new goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) algorithm to adaptively control ESD to damp inter-area oscillation. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based power oscillation damper (POD) has also been proposed for comparison. Various simulation studies with residue-based POD controller design, the proposed PSO optimized controller design, and the GrHDP-based controller design over a four-machine-two-area benchmark power system with energy storage device have been conducted. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the GrHDP-based approach for inter-area oscillation damping in a wide range of system operating conditions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6879345/06754155.pdf","startPage":"2539","endPage":"2548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Storage-Based Low-Frequency Oscillation Damping Control Using Particle Swarm Optimization and Heuristic Dynamic Programming","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2305977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6879345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2305977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Storage-Based Low-Frequency Oscillation Damping Control Using Particle Swarm Optimization and Heuristic Dynamic Programming","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525678","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6754155/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Storage-Based Low-Frequency Oscillation Damping Control Using Particle Swarm Optimization and Heuristic Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-he-2305977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053755S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","isNumber":"6879345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"97","articleId":"6754155","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6754162,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic van Dijk","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"van Dijk","id":"37270418100"},{"name":"Gael Kervella","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Gael","lastName":"Kervella","id":"37071477700"},{"name":"Marco Lamponi","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lamponi","id":"37547128200"},{"name":"Mourad Chtioui","affiliation":["Thales Air Systems, Limours, France"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Chtioui","id":"37402726200"},{"name":"Francois Lelarge","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Lelarge","id":"37277880600"},{"name":"Eric Vinet","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Vinet","id":"37713123800"},{"name":"Yannick Robert","affiliation":["III-V Laboratory, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Robert","id":"37721884700"},{"name":"Martyn J.

Critical issues arising at ultra-low voltages are analyzed, including static robustness of TFET logic gates, performance degradation, and sensitivity to process variations. Guidelines to design ultra-low energy standard cell libraries are derived. The minimum energy point is analyzed in a wide range of conditions, and guidelines for microarchitectural optimization for ultra-low energy are introduced. Voltage scalability of static RAM memories is also analyzed as main limitation to aggressive voltage scaling of very large scale integration (VLSI) systems, and improved precharge schemes are introduced to reduce leakage. The impact of variations of the main device parameters on VLSI digital circuits is investigated to identify the most critical variations that need to be controlled at process level. This investigation permits to understand the potential of TFETs and their advantages over traditional devices within a unitary framework that is based on fair design and comparison from device to circuit level, as well as to develop clear design perspectives in the context of ULV/ULP VLSI digital circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754164/","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6754164/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14760407","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tunnel FETs for Ultra-Low Voltage Digital VLSI Circuits: Part II\u2013Evaluation at Circuit Level and Design Perspectives","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU through the STEEPER project","grantNumber":"257267"},{"fundingName":"Italian MIUR through the Futuro in Ricerca 2010","grantNumber":"RBFR10XQZ8"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunnel FETs for Ultra-Low Voltage Digital VLSI Circuits: Part II\u2013Evaluation at Circuit Level and Design Perspectives","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-alioto-2293153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091581S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6754164","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6754169,"authors":[{"name":"Gursharan Reehal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6963544/6754169/reeha-2296742-small.gif","p":["Gursharan Reehal (M'09) received the B.S.

In NoCs, power estimations in the early stages of the design help the designers to optimize the design for energy consumption and efficiently map applications to achieve low-power solutions. However, in 90-nm designs or below, the impact of parasitics not only influence timing closure, but also leads to variability in power and area budgets among different NoC architectures. There is a growing need for advanced design methodologies to overcome these issues in NoC designs. This paper presents a system-level design methodology based on layout and power models to achieve low-power and high-performance NoC designs. The impact of global interconnects with and without repeater insertion on the bandwidth and power is considered. Width and spacing of global interconnects and its effect on performance and power dissipation are analyzed. For architectural-level power analysis, different router designs for Chip-Level Integration of Communicating Heterogeneous Elements (CLICHE), Butterfly Fat Tree (BFT), Scalable, Programmable, Integrated Network (SPIN), and Octagon NoC architectures are implemented using ARMs 65-nm standard cell library in 65-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) process. The router designs are synthesized in RVT process using a ${V}_{\\rm dd}$ of 1.0 V and a temperature of 25$^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$ . Synopsys Prime Time-PX design tool is used for calculating average power dissipation of the router designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Design Methodology for Low-Power NoCs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2296742","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6963544/06754169.pdf","startPage":"2585","endPage":"2595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2296742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Design Methodology for Low-Power NoCs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6754169/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14760397","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ATIC, Abu Dhabi"},{"fundingName":"KSRC, Kustar, UAE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Design Methodology for Low-Power NoCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-reehal-2296742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102857S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6754169","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6754170,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Giordanengo","affiliation":["EMC Lab (LACE), Istituto Superiore Mario Boella (ISMB), Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6754170/6754170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giorgio Giordanengo received the B.Sc. degree in electronics engineering, the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering, and the Engineering Professional Qualification in the Information field from the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2006, 2009, and 2010, respectively, where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree.

Superior performance and lower complexity compared with previous methods are numerically confirmed for a typical narrow-angle broadband multibeam beamformer of the type that could be used in radio astronomy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2304885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798683","startPage":"279","endPage":"283","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6798683/06754172.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using 1-D Variable Fractional-Delay Filters to Reduce the Computational Complexity of 3-D Broadband Multibeam Beamformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6754172/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using 1-D Variable Fractional-Delay Filters to Reduce the Computational Complexity of 3-D Broadband Multibeam Beamformers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239368","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using 1-D Variable Fractional-Delay Filters to Reduce the Computational Complexity of 3-D Broadband Multibeam Beamformers","sourcePdf":"tcsii-agathoklis-2304885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075557S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6798683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6798683","articleId":"6754172","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6754175,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Andreasson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6840376/6754175/andre-2309281-small.gif","p":["\nMartin Andreasson (S'12) received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics\nfrom the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2011 where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D.\ndegree.","His research interests include distributed control of multi-agent systems, and control of power systems."]},"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Andreasson","id":"37410210100"},{"name":"Dimos V.

We propose a class of nonlinear consensus controllers where the input of each agent can be written as a product of a nonlinear gain, and a sum of nonlinear interaction functions. By using integral Lyapunov functions, we prove the stability of the proposed control protocols, and explicitly characterize the equilibrium set. We also propose a distributed proportional-integral (PI) controller for networked dynamical systems. The PI controllers successfully attenuate constant disturbances in the network. We prove that agents with single-integrator dynamics are stable for any integral gain, and give an explicit tight upper bound on the integral gain for when the system is stable for agents with double-integrator dynamics. Throughout the paper we highlight some possible applications of the proposed controllers by realistic simulations of autonomous satellites, power systems and building temperature control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6840376/06754175.pdf","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2309281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2309281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Control of Networked Dynamical Systems: Static Feedback, Integral Action and Consensus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Power system stability","Power system dynamics","Frequency control","Satellites","Decentralized control","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","Lyapunov methods","networked control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","PI control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static feedback","distributed control protocols","second-order networked dynamical systems","first-order networked dynamical systems","nonlinear consensus controllers","nonlinear gain","nonlinear interaction functions","integral Lyapunov functions","stability","equilibrium set","distributed proportional-integral controller","PI controller","constant disturbance attenuation","integral gain","upper bound","double-integrator dynamics","autonomous satellites","power systems","building temperature control","single-integrator dynamics"]},{"kwd":["Agents and autonomous systems","cooperative control","electrical power systems","proportional integral (PI) control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Control of Networked Dynamical Systems: Static Feedback, Integral Action and Consensus","volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6754175/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14397154","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR)"},{"fundingName":"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation","grantNumber":"VR 2009-3948"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Control of Networked Dynamical Systems: Static Feedback, Integral Action and Consensus","sourcePdf":"tac-andreasson-2309281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127726S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6840376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"6840376","articleId":"6754175","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6754176,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro E.

The impact of pre-emphasis (PE), necessary to mitigate the setup frequency limitations, on the PAPR reduction achieved by symbol precoding is investigated. At the input of the optical modulator, PAPR reductions of ~ 3 dB with PE and without PE are achieved using the precoding technique without band excess; with precoding with band excess of 25%, PAPR reductions of ~ 4 dB with PE and 4.5 dB without PE are obtained.

Modeling of a CLCB is important for the calculation of short-circuit current and arc flash energy. Based on the analysis of the arc voltage waveforms of CLCBs, a new arc model is derived. The Schwarz arc model and arc length are used to represent the complicated voltages of CLCBs, and arc length is determined from a differential equation. The test results of a commercial CLCB sequentially deployed in a couple of three-phase power systems are studied, and the parameters of the model are obtained. The three-phase faults in the power systems are simulated. The short-circuit currents and voltages of the CLCB are calculated and compared to the test results. The simulation results are in good agreement with the test data, and the proposed model can predict the high-current arcs in CLCBs.

We propose scalable effort hardware as a design approach to tap the reservoir of application resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations. The first tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture, and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended toward generation of the correct (exact) result, and to expose these mechanisms as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. The second tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of application resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient recognition and mining (RM) processor based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. Results from the execution of support vector machine training and classification, generalized learning vector quantization training, and k-means clustering on the scalable effort RM processor show that it can achieve energy reductions of 1.2\u00d7-5\u00d7 with negligible impact on output quality, and 2.2\u00d7-50\u00d7 with moderate loss in output quality, across various data sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization across different scaling mechanisms leads to higher energy savings (1.4\u00d7-2\u00d7 on an average) for a given output quality compared with each of the individual techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Hardware","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Resilience","Support vector machines","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","pattern clustering","performance evaluation","power aware computing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable effort hardware","k-means clustering","learning vector quantization training","support vector machine","RM processor","recognition and mining processor","synergistic cross-layer optimization","scaling mechanisms","Boolean equivalence","numerical equivalence","power optimization","inherent application resilience"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","approximate computing","design","scalable effort hardware."]},{"kwd":["Algorithms","approximate computing","design","scalable effort hardware"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754190","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2276759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6881768/06754190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2276759","startPage":"2004","endPage":"2016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6881768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Effort Hardware Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Effort Hardware Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754190/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2014","volume":"22","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6754190/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14560523","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1018621"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Effort Hardware Design","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chippa-2276759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126993S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6881768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6881768","articleId":"6754190","onlineDate":"03 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6754222,"authors":[{"name":"Qingfeng Jing","affiliation":["College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Jing"},{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Yuping Lu","affiliation":["College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China"],"firstName":"Yuping","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Weizhi Zhong","affiliation":["College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China"],"firstName":"Weizhi","lastName":"Zhong"},{"name":"Hongwei Yao","affiliation":["College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Yao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"6754222","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Algorithm design and analysis","Synchronization","Frequency synchronization","Noise measurement","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","frame synchronization","carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation","preamble","pseudo-noise sequence"]}],"abstract":"Frame and frequency synchronization are essential for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The frame offset owing to incorrect start point position of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) window, and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) due to Doppler frequency shift or the frequency mismatch between the transmitter and receiver oscillators, can bring severe intersymbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) for the OFDM system. Relying on the relatively good correlation characteristic of the pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, a joint frame offset and normalized CFO estimation algorithm based on PN preamble in time domain is developed to realize the frame and frequency synchronization in the OFDM system. By comparison, the performances of the traditional algorithm and the improved algorithm are simulated under different conditions. The results indicate that the PN preamble based algorithm both in frame offset estimation and CFO estimation is more accurate, resource-saving and robust even under poor channel condition, such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and large normalized CFO.","doi":"10.1109/JSEE.2014.00001","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/6754220/06754222.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEE.2014.00001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754220","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo-noise preamble based joint frame and frequency synchronization algorithm in OFDM communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-noise preamble based joint frame and frequency synchronization algorithm in OFDM communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Pseudo-noise preamble based joint frame and frequency synchronization algorithm in OFDM communication systems","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048365S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6754220","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6754222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6754223,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Mao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Mao"},{"name":"Jianjun Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Haige Xiang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China"],"firstName":"Haige","lastName":"Xiang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"6754223","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754223","abstract":"This paper focuses on reducing the complexity of K-best sphere decoding (SD) algorithm for the detection of uncoded multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems.

Both the known noise value and the unknown noise value are considered to generate the threshold, which is the sum of the two values. The known noise value is the smallest PED of signals in the detected layers.

When a new vulnerability is discovered, it needs to be assessed so that it can be prioritized. A major challenge in software security is the assessment of the potential risk due to vulnerability exploitability. CVSS metrics have become a de facto standard that is commonly used to assess the severity of a vulnerability. The CVSS Base Score measures severity based on exploitability and impact measures. CVSS exploitability is measured based on three metrics: Access Vector, Authentication, and Access Complexity. However, CVSS exploitability measures assign subjective numbers based on the views of experts. Two of its factors, Access Vector and Authentication, are the same for almost all vulnerabilities. CVSS does not specify how the third factor, Access Complexity, is measured, and hence we do not know if it considers software properties as a factor. In this paper, we propose an approach that assesses the risk of vulnerability exploitability based on two software properties - attack surface entry points and reach ability analysis. A vulnerability is reachable if it is located in one of the entry points or is located in a function that is called either directly or indirectly by the entry points. The likelihood of an entry point being used in an attack can be assessed by using damage potential-effort ratio in the attack surface metric and the presence of system calls deemed dangerous. To illustrate the proposed method, five reported vulnerabilities of Apache HTTP server 1.3.0 have been examined at the source code level. The results show that the proposed approach, which uses more detailed information, can yield a risk assessment that can be different from the CVSS Base Score.","doi":"10.1109/HASE.2014.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2014.10","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6754245/6754569/06754581.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Attack Surface Entry Points and Reachability Analysis to Assess the Risk of Software Vulnerability Exploitability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Using Attack Surface Entry Points and Reachability Analysis to Assess the Risk of Software Vulnerability Exploitability","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754581/","accessionNumber":"14156741","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754581/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Attack Surface Entry Points and Reachability Analysis to Assess the Risk of Software Vulnerability Exploitability","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3466a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053031S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6754245","isNumber":"6754569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6754245","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6754569","articleId":"6754581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6754605,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Luo","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, BU, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086733883"},{"name":"Andy Yu-Lun Lin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, BU, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Andy Yu-Lun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086732830"},{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Mediatek Wireless, Inc., Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537359500"},{"name":"Mark Karpovsky","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, BU, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Karpovsky","id":"37275727100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3466-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3465-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2059"}],"articleNumber":"6754605","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754605","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Robustness","Polynomials","Hardware","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure Shamir secret sharing scheme","algebraic manipulation detection codes","AMD","robust codes","security level","attack models","cheating models","timing overheads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shamir's secret sharing","security","error detection codes","hardware implementation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HASE.2014.34","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6754245/6754569/06754605.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2014.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Secure Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme","abstract":"Shamir's secret sharing scheme is an effective way to distribute secret to a group of shareholders.

The proposed new descriptor is represented by a histogram of local directional pattern (LDP) computed from extracted region of interest (ROI) of fingerprint images. For fingerprint matching, we propose a single hidden layer neural network (SLFN), which combines a powerful extreme learning machine (ELM) and a well generalized resilient propagation (RPROP) algorithm. The proposed fingerprint matching system comprises the following steps: fingerprint pre-processing/enhancement, ROI extraction, invariant LDP feature extraction, and matching using proposed hybrid classifier.

But the load of handling traffic increases on the nodes which are closer to the sink or the base station (BS), as it has to carry others traffic along with its own towards the BS and depletes more energy which causes network holes. The power transmitted by the nodes could be controllable and each sensor can transmit directly to the BS but the farthest nodes consume more power and die earlier. Here we develop an efficient clustering technique in which cluster heads (CH) are formed and are supposed to send the data to the BS and the role of CH is changed in each rotation. The finalization of the CH is based on the energy distribution and its selection procedure is optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that with this approach the stable operating period increases and is compared with probabilistic and EC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2013.24","pdfPath":"/iel7/6754318/6754745/06754785.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2013.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Clustering Solution for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Energy Distribution & Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Clustering Solution for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Energy Distribution & Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14196951","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6754785/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Clustering Solution for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Energy Distribution & Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2561a094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05816S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6754318","isNumber":"6754745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6754318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6754745","articleId":"6754785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6754791,"authors":[{"name":"Neeta Nathani","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, G.H.

The scene text in video contains semantic information and thus can contribute significantly to video retrieval and understanding. However, most of the approaches detect scene text in still images or single video frame. Videos differ from images in temporal redundancy. This paper proposes a novel hybrid method to robustly localize the texts in natural scene images and videos based on fusion of discrete wavelet transform and gradient difference. A set of rules and geometric properties have been devised to localize the actual text regions. Then, morphological operation is performed to generate the text regions and finally the connected component analysis is employed to localize the text in a video frame. The experimental results obtained on publicly available standard ICDAR 2003 and Hua dataset illustrate that the proposed method can accurately detect and localize texts of various sizes, fonts and colors. The experimentation on huge collection of video databases reveal the suitability of the proposed method to video databases.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIP.2014.50","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751598/6754822/06754889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIP.2014.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754822","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform and Gradient Difference Based Approach for Text Localization in Videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform and Gradient Difference Based Approach for Text Localization in Videos","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754889/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14199036","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6754889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Wavelet Transform and Gradient Difference Based Approach for Text Localization in Videos","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"5100a280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134532S","chronDate":"8-10 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751598","isNumber":"6754822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751598","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6754822","articleId":"6754889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6754945,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["DII Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Marco Bianchi","affiliation":["DII Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37707890500"},{"name":"Nicola Maturo","affiliation":["DII Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Maturo","id":"38667145700"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["DII Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"6754945","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754945","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Public key","Context","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","Goppa codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code-based McEliece cryptosystem","irregular codes","low-density parity-check","LDPC codes","public key cryptosystems","Goppa codes","error correction performance","irregular transformation matrices","public key size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["McEliece cryptosystem","irregular LDPC codes"]}],"abstract":"We consider the framework of the McEliece cryptosystem based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which is a promising post-quantum alternative to classical public key cryptosystems.

However, only regular LDPC codes have been considered up to now, while some further improvement can be achieved by using irregular LDPC codes, which are known to achieve better error correction performance than regular LDPC codes.

The main idea behind this design is the balancing of the transmission delays between the uplink and downlink to avoid resource wastage and service degradation that can result from transmission imbalances. Results show an improved constrained delay behavior of the system. Moreover, using the definition of a satisfaction index based on the well-known Jain fairness index, we show how our proposed scheme outperforms traditional single-link resource allocation schemes in terms of user satisfaction.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754955","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746555/6754912/06754955.pdf","startPage":"000257","endPage":"000262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On delay-aware joint uplink/downlink resource allocation in OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754955/","displayDocTitle":"On delay-aware joint uplink/downlink resource allocation in OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14146900","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754955/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On delay-aware joint uplink/downlink resource allocation in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"S054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069988S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746555","isNumber":"6754912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746555","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6754912","articleId":"6754955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6754956,"authors":[{"name":"Yanhong Ju","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Yanhong Ju","id":"38245817100"},{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Songlin Sun","id":"37597424300"},{"name":"Fei Qi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Fei Qi","id":"37085531890"},{"name":"Xiaojun Jing","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Jing"},{"name":"Yueming Lu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Yueming Lu","id":"37086727224"},{"name":"Na Chen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Na Chen","id":"37085373950"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"6754956","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Educational institutions","Frequency estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","estimation theory","Fourier analysis","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly selective wireless channel tap reconstruction","piloted-aided OFDM system","estimation method","reexpansion channel estimation process","Fourier coefficient","basis expansion model","BEM","least square problem","LS problem","inverse method","minimum mean square error criterion","MMSE criterion","IEEE 802.16e standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Basis Expansion Model (BEM)","channel estimation","doubly selective","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved method for reconstruction of doubly selective wireless channels in piloted-aided OFDM systems based an existing estimation method is proposed.

An attractive parallel computing platform that is widely used at present is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In this paper we present an efficient technique that uses the red-black Gauss-Seidel method to solve PDEs. This technique allows the efficient use of the relatively larger register file available in each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), as well as the shared memory. It also allows the communication between the threads of a block. We employ the red-black Gauss-Seidel method, in this paper, to solve the 2D steady state heat conduction problem on two different GPUs. An overall speedup of 484 relative to the CPU sequential implementation is achieved. A speedup of about 2.6 relative to Foster's GPU implementation on the same GPUs is also achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754958","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","startPage":"000269","endPage":"000274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754912","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746555/6754912/06754958.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Instruction sets","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","graphics processing units","parallel processing","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast GPU algorithms","red-black Gauss-Seidel method","partial differential equations","PDE","efficient parallel implementations","parallel computing platform","graphics processing unit","streaming multiprocessor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PDEs","GPUs","Steady state heat conduction problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast GPU algorithms for implementing the red-black Gauss-Seidel method for Solving Partial Differential Equations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6754958/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6754958/","accessionNumber":"14146940","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast GPU algorithms for implementing the red-black Gauss-Seidel method for Solving Partial Differential Equations","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"S062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066906S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746555","isNumber":"6754912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746555","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6754912","articleId":"6754958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6754961,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["DII Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Marco Bianchi","affiliation":["DII Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37707890500"},{"name":"Nicola Maturo","affiliation":["DII Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Maturo","id":"38667145700"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["DII Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"6754961","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6754961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Rayleigh channels","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-length LDPC codes","fast Rayleigh fading wiretap channel","physical layer security","secrecy capacity","information theoretic arguments","ultimate security bounds","error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast fading wire-tap channel","LDPC codes","physical layer security","security gap"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we carry out a practical assessment of the performance of finite-length LDPC codes over the wiretap channel with fast Rayleigh fading.

In a visible-light communication (VLC) system, the transmission nature can be of two types: (1) all LEDs transmit the same signal stream simultaneously; or (2) each LED transmits different parts of a signal stream independently. The MIMO-diversity technique detects and computes the transmitted signal power during reception and conditionally informs the transmitter to switch between Type (1) and Type (2) transmission. Two experimental models have been tested to show the feasibility of such a technique. In the first model, we constructed a full transceiver and uses a switch IC to switch between MIMO and diversity. The second model uses a microcontroller and software decision to switch between two COM ports, each of them dedicated to MIMO and diversity output respectively. Results suggest that shadowing and alignment problems commonly encountered in visible-light communication systems can be readily solved using these methods. A focusing equation has also been formulated to predict signal intensity more accurately. The focusing gap between the concentrator and the photodiode is taken into consideration during channel computation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-diversity switching techniques for digital transmission in visible light communication","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755008","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746555/6754912/06755008.pdf","startPage":"000576","endPage":"000582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6754912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-diversity switching techniques for digital transmission in visible light communication","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755008/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14146919","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-diversity switching techniques for digital transmission in visible light communication","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"S172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094784S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746555","isNumber":"6754912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746555","xplore-issue":"6754912","articleId":"6755008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6755009,"authors":[{"name":"Maha Cherif Dakhli","affiliation":["Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Cherif Dakhli","id":"37846071200"},{"name":"Rafik Zayani","affiliation":["Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rafik","lastName":"Zayani","id":"37297085500"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37297081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"6755009","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","MIMO","Nonlinear distortion","Channel capacity","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","polynomials","radio receivers","radiofrequency power amplifiers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","nonlinear distortion compensation","iterative estimation","MMSE receiver","minimum mean square error receiver","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","nonlinear polynomial model","HPA","multiple-input multiple-output channel","high power amplifier","Rayleigh fading channel","MIMO OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","HPA","nonlinear polynomial model","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"The nonlinearity of High Power Amplifiers (HPAs) has crucial effects on the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO).

The next generation networks must be able to service heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is important techniques for high data rate wireless multiuser communication systems, such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), not only because of its flexibility in resource allocation, but also because of its ability to exploit multiuser diversity.

The efficient job scheduling increases the client satisfaction and utilize the system energy in terms of time. A Multi Queue Scheduling (MQS) algorithm proposed to reduces the cost of both reservation and on-demand plans using the global scheduler. Scheduling is the most important complex part in cloud computing. The ultimate aim of global scheduler is to share the resources at most the maximum level. Researcher gives more importance to build a job scheduling algorithms that are well-suited and appropriate in Cloud computing situation. Job scheduling is one of the critical event in cloud computing because the user have to pay for services based on usage time. The proposed methodology depicts the concept of clustering the jobs based on burst time. During the time of scheduling the traditional methods such as First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, EASY, Combinational Backfill and Improved backfill using balance spiral method are creates fragmentation. The proposed method overcome this problem and reduces the starvation with in the process. This paper also focus some existing scheduling algorithm and issues related to them in cloud computing. The proposed MQS method gives more importance to select job dynamically in order to achieve the optimum cloud scheduling problem and hence it utilize the unused free space in an economic way.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Multi Queue Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/WCCCT.2014.8","startPage":"164","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCCCT.2014.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755083","publicationTitle":"2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6754623/6755083/06755128.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 27 2014-March 1 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Multi Queue Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755128/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14220423","conferenceDate":"27 Feb.-1 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Multi Queue Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Trichirappalli, India","sourcePdf":"2877a164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06856S","chronDate":"Feb. 27 2014-March 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6754623","isNumber":"6755083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6754623","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6755083","articleId":"6755128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6755130,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The proposed system integrates Micro array Technology, Digital Image Processing and Artificial Neural Networks. By applying micro array technology to the parental DNA, a gene expression image can be obtained. The extracted gene image is further characterized with the help of Digital Image processing. A neural network is trained with the mutated value which lists the probability of diseases to the infants. The proposed architecture is implemented in MATLAB.

In most cases, the provider must guarantee that their infrastructure is secure and clients' data and applications are safe, by implementing security policies and mechanisms. The security issues are organized into several general categories: trust, identity management, software isolation, data protection, availability reliability, ownership, data backup, data portability and conversion, multi platform support and intellectual property.

Hence, building a highly dependable and reliable cloud system has become a critical research problem. This paper presents BFT-MCDB (Byzantine Fault Tolerance Multi-Clouds Database), a practical model for building a system with Byzantine fault tolerance in a multi-cloud environment. The model relies on a novel approach that combines Byzantine Agreement protocols and Shamir's secret sharing approach to detect Byzantine failure in a multi-cloud computing environment as well as ensuring the security of the stored data within the cloud. Using qualitative analysis, we show that adopting the Byzantine Agreement protocols in the proposed BFT-MCDB model increases system reliability and enables gains in regard to the three security dimensions (data integrity, data confidentiality, and service availability). We also carry out experiments to determine the overheads of using the Agreement protocols.","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2013.30","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724092/6755170/06755208.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2013.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model for a Multi-cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755208/","displayDocTitle":"A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model for a Multi-cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145876","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755208/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model for a Multi-cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066445S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6755218,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086600663"},{"name":"Yinliang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yinliang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37557067700"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37073640500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5096-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755218","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755218","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Vectors","Flow graphs","Predictive models","Euclidean distance","Optimization","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","program compilers","source code (software)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning techniques","compiler writers","program characterization","fixed-length feature vector","source code feature","compile time","performance counters","program features","similarity values","similar degree assessment","program sample similarity assessment","theory of fuzzy","Euclidean Distance","similarity degree Assessment","fuzzy function","graph-based characterization technique","graph-based model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Theory of Fuzzy","Similarity Assessment","code features"]}],"abstract":"Using machine learning has proven effective at choosing the right set of optimizations for a particular program. For machine learning techniques to be most effective, compiler writers have to develop expressive means of characterizing the program being optimized.

According to the program features, similarity values are calculated to assess the similar degree. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of assessing the similarity of two program samples using Theory of Fuzzy. We firstly calculate the Euclidean Distance of two different program samples as the input, and then assess the overall similarity degree as well as respective similarity degree, using corresponding Fuzzy Function. The graph-based characterization technique is cited, which shows great advantages than state-of-the-art characterization techniques found in the literature. By using the sequences predicted to be the best by the graph-based model, we compare the known sequences with unknown ones, and calculate the similarity between them, then obtain the similarity degree. Using these degrees, we are directed to make better determination to cluster or classify.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2013.40","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724092/6755170/06755218.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2013.40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Similarity Assessment of Program Samples Based on Theory of Fuzzy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Similarity Assessment of Program Samples Based on Theory of Fuzzy","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6755218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145865","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755218/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Similarity Assessment of Program Samples Based on Theory of Fuzzy","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071991S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6755234,"authors":[{"name":"Elisa Margareth Sibarani","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering Study Program, Del Institute of Technology, North Sumatra, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Elisa Margareth","lastName":"Sibarani","id":"38489029400"},{"name":"Mhd.

In a series of natural language processing, the initial step is parsing the sentence in a particular language based on the grammar in order to help understanding the meaning of a sentence. This research aims to produce a simulation of Indonesian parser by adapting the process which was conducted by using Collins Algorithm. The three main stages are: 1) preprocessing to generate corpus and events files, 2) lexical analysis to convert the corpus into tokens, and 3) syntax analysis to build parse tree that requires file events to calculate the probability of the grammar by count the occurrence frequency on file events to determine the best sentence trees. An evaluation was performed to the parser using 30 simple sentences and the outcomes were able to generate a corpus file, file events, parse-tree and probability calculations. Nevertheless some sentences could not be parsed completely true because of the limitations of the Tree bank file in Indonesian. Some future works are to develop complete and valid Tree bank and Lexicon files.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145914","htmlLink":"/document/6755234/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Parsing Process on Natural Language Processing in Bahasa Indonesia","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Parsing Process on Natural Language Processing in Bahasa Indonesia","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040748S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6755236,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6724092/6755170/6755236/6755236-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tony Tsang received the BEng degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering with First Class Honours in U.K., in 1992.

State-of-the art flexible NB-LDPC decoders cannot simultaneously achieve the high throughput mandated by these standards and the low power needed for mobile applications. Although various kinds of low complexity iterative decoding algorithms have been proposed, the FPGA implementation of NB-LDPC decoders still remains a big challenge due to its high complexity and long latency. Moreover, Prototype architecture of the NB-LDPC codes has been implemented by writing Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code and targeted to a Xilinx Spartan-3E XC3S500E FPGA chip. In this brief, a highly efficient check node processing scheme, which the processing delay greatly reduced, is proposed for Min-max decoding algorithm. Thereafter, an efficient check node unit (CNU) can be designed. Compared with previous works, the latency of the CNU could be reduced to less than 52%. In addition, a decoder for a (620, 310) NB-LDPC code is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Computer architecture","Vectors","Fading","Throughput","Turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","field programmable gate arrays","forward error correction","hardware description languages","iterative decoding","parity check codes","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary LDPC decoder design","wireless communications","nonbinary low density parity check codes","NB-LDPC codes","forward error correction","iterative decoding","hardware description language","VHDL code","Xilinx Spartan-3E XC3S500E FPGA chip","check node processing","check node unit","CNU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Communications","Nonbinary Low Density Parity Check","Hardware Description Language","Performance Analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2013.57","startPage":"325","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724092/6755170/06755236.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2013.57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Design and Implementation on FPGA Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Design and Implementation on FPGA Platform","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14145871","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6755236/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Design and Implementation on FPGA Platform","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036936S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6755250,"authors":[{"name":"Matheus Ara\u00fajo Aguiar","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Matheus Ara\u00fajo","lastName":"Aguiar","id":"37086773941"},{"name":"Rita Maria Silva Julia","firstName":"Rita Maria Silva","lastName":"Julia"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5096-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755250","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755250","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Vectors","Mathematical model","Hamming distance","Monte Carlo methods","Equations","Open source software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","distributed memory systems","Monte Carlo methods","multi-agent systems","public domain software","search problems","software agents","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDM-Go","search process improvement","Monte-Carlo tree search","sparse distributed memory","game boards","bit based representation","MC simulations","open-source agent","Fuego"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game","Agent for Go","Sparse Distributed Memory","Monte Carlo Tree Search","Simulations"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the player agent for Go named SDM-Go.

WSNs are deployed in a wide range of applications with a high demand for secure communications. When designing a secure key management protocol for WSNs, special attention should be given to the resource constraints of the devices and the scalability of the network. In this paper, we exploit public-key nature protocols to define a hybrid key establishment algorithm for symmetric key cryptography. We propose an Elliptic Curve Cryptography based implicit certificate scheme and show how to utilize the certificates for deriving pair-wise link keys in a WSN. By a performance and security analysis, we justify that the proposed scheme is well fitting with the functional and architectural features of WSNs. Both experimental results and theoretical analysis show that the proposed key establishment protocol is viable to deploy in a real-time WSN application.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2013.103","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724092/6755170/06755283.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"674","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2013.103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Certificate-Based Pairwise Key Establishment Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Certificate-Based Pairwise Key Establishment Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6755283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14145803","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755283/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Certificate-Based Pairwise Key Establishment Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056333S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6755286,"authors":[{"name":"Noriaki Suzuki","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriaki","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37086684604"},{"name":"Hyoseung Kim","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Hyoseung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38481621900"},{"name":"Dionisio de Niz","firstName":"Dionisio de","lastName":"Niz"},{"name":"Bjorn Andersson","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Andersson","id":"37338670800"},{"name":"Lutz Wrage","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Wrage","id":"37296449900"},{"name":"Mark Klein","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Klein","id":"37269742600"},{"name":"Ragunathan Rajkumar","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ragunathan","lastName":"Rajkumar","id":"37268048500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5096-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755286","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Interference","Resource management","Multicore processing","Indexes","Image color analysis","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","Linux","operating system kernels","shared memory systems","virtual storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commercial-off-the-shelf multicore system","shared cache set","bank interference effects","cache interference effects","DRAM memory","cache partition","memory accesses","cache level","coordinated cache-bank coloring scheme","color allocation algorithms","virtual memory system","Linux kernel","intertask interference","COTS multicore systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["real-time systems","memory banks","cache","page coloring","multicore"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755286","abstract":"In commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multi-core systems, the execution times of tasks become hard to predict because of contention on shared resources in the memory hierarchy. In particular, a task running in one processor core can delay the execution of another task running in another processor core. This is due to the fact that tasks can access data in the same cache set shared among processor cores or in the same memory bank in the DRAM memory (or both). Such cache and bank interference effects have motivated the need to create isolation mechanisms for resources accessed by more than one task. One popular isolation mechanism is cache coloring that divides the cache into multiple partitions. With cache coloring, each task can be assigned exclusive cache partitions, thereby preventing cache interference from other tasks. Similarly, bank coloring allows assigning exclusive bank partitions to tasks. While cache coloring and some bank coloring mechanisms have been studied separately, interactions between the two schemes have not been studied. Specifically, while memory accesses to two different bank colors do not interfere with each other at the bank level, they may interact at the cache level. Similarly, two different cache colors avoid cache interference but may not prevent bank interference. Therefore it is necessary to coordinate cache and bank coloring approaches. In this paper, we present a coordinated cache and bank coloring scheme that is designed to prevent cache and bank interference simultaneously. We also developed color allocation algorithms for configuring a virtual memory system to support our scheme which has been implemented in the Linux kernel. In our experiments, we observed that the execution time can increase by 60% due to inter-task interference when we use only cache coloring. Our coordinated approach can reduce this figure down to 12% (an 80% reduction).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755170","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724092/6755170/06755286.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2013.106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2013.106","startPage":"685","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Bank and Cache Coloring for Temporal Protection of Memory Accesses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755286/","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Bank and Cache Coloring for Temporal Protection of Memory Accesses","htmlLink":"/document/6755286/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14145822","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Bank and Cache Coloring for Temporal Protection of Memory Accesses","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"5096a685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067427S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724092","isNumber":"6755170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724092","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6755170","articleId":"6755286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6755345,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37066596500"},{"name":"Rajiv Ranjan","affiliation":["Computational Informatics, CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"38547753100"},{"name":"Xuyun Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xuyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898426000"},{"name":"Chi Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404771800"},{"name":"Dimitrios Georgakopoulos","affiliation":["Computational Informatics, CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Georgakopoulos","id":"38520348900"},{"name":"Jinjun Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280682600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5096-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755345","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1503},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","Security","Cloud computing","Distributed databases","Cascading style sheets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","data analysis","data privacy","security of data","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public auditing","Big Data storage","cloud computing","qualities of service","data security","data privacy","big data analytics","outsourced data","authenticator-based efficient data integrity verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","big data","data security","integrity verification","public auditing"]}],"abstract":"Data integrity is an important factor to ensure in almost any data and computation related context.

Although many community detection (CD) algorithms have been proposed, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive links. Thus, it is important to design CD algorithms which can handle large-scale SNs. To this purpose, we first extend the original similarity to the signed similarity based on the social balance theory. Then, based on the signed similarity and the natural contradiction between positive and negative links, two objective functions are designed to model the problem of detecting communities in SNs as a multiobjective problem. Afterward, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MEAsSN. In MEAs-SN, to overcome the defects of direct and indirect representations for communities, a direct and indirect combined representation is designed. Attributing to this representation, MEAs-SN can switch between different representations during the evolutionary process. As a result, MEAs-SN can benefit from both representations. Moreover, owing to this representation, MEAs-SN can also detect overlapping communities directly. In the experiments, both benchmark problems and large-scale synthetic networks generated by various parameter settings are used to validate the performance of MEAs-SN. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficacy of MEAs-SN on networks with 1000, 5000, and 10000 nodes and also in various noisy situations.

Active area dependence of dark current and activation energy as small as 0.17 eV strongly suggest that the surface leakage current is negligible, and the edge breakdown does not occur.

The GHR processor based on radix-25/16/9 uses a 2-D factorization scheme as the high-radix unit and a 1-D factorization method as the system data routing technology. The 2-D factorization scheme is implemented by an enhanced delay element matrix structure, which supports 25-, 16-, 9-, 8-, 5-, 4-, 3-, and 2-point FFTs. Two different designs were implemented. One design (called discrete Fourier transform core) supports 34 different transform sizes from 12 to 1296 points, while the other design (called FFT core) supports five different power-of-two sizes from 128 to 2048 points. The 1-D factorization method is performed by a coprime accessing technology, which accesses the data in parallel without conflict using a RAM. The GHR combines 2-D and 1-D factorization techniques and improves the throughput by a factor of two to four with comparable hardware cost compared with the previous designs. The speed-area ratio of the proposed scheme is nearly two times better than that of previous FFT processors. Application-specified integrated circuit implementation results based on a 0.18-\u03bcm technology are also provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755459/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","volume":"23","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14915134","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6755459/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Efficient Mixed Radix-25/16/9 FFT for LTE Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61101033 and 61070696"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Project of China","grantNumber":"2012AA011702"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Efficient Mixed Radix-25/16/9 FFT for LTE Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chen-2304834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087252S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7027264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7027264","articleId":"6755459","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6755461,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A novel DoF upper bound is derived by providing users with carefully designed genie information. Achievable DoF is identified using signal space alignment and multiple-access transmission. For the two-cluster MIMO multiway relay channel with two users in each cluster, the DoF is established for the general case when users and the relay have arbitrary number of antennas, and it is shown that the DoF upper bound can be achieved using signal space alignment or multiple-access transmission, or a combination of both. The result is then generalized to the three user case. For the L-cluster K-user MIMO multiway relay channel in the symmetric setting, conditions under which the DoF upper bound can be achieved are established. In addition to being shown to be tight in a variety of scenarios of interests of the multiway relay channel, the newly derived upperbound also establishes the optimality of several previously established achievable DoF results for multiuser relay channels that are special cases of the multiway relay channel.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Upper bound","Antennas","Interference","Vectors","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser relay channels","antennas","two-cluster MIMO multiway relay channel","multiple-access transmission","signal space alignment","DoF upper bound","L-cluster K-user MIMO multiway relay channel","degrees of freedom"]},{"kwd":["MIMO multi-way relay channel","degrees of freedom","signal space alignment","interference alignment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2309646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06755480.pdf","startPage":"2495","endPage":"2511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2309646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom for the MIMO Multi-Way Relay Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom for the MIMO Multi-Way Relay Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755480/","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755480/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14251119","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"0964364 and 0964362"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom for the MIMO Multi-Way Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-yener-2309646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090736S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6755480","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6755486,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Shui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6845385/6755486/zhang-2306957-small.gif","p":["Mu-Shui Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He has been a Faculty Member with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, since 2009, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

An optimized mining flow is presented for large scale data set, where the data processing and data mining are performed simultaneously, and thus it is unnecessary to save large extracted data. The proposed data mining method consider both the interconnect structure and the stimulated pattern of a MIMO system, which can perform thoughtful analysis and optimization with high efficiency. Two examples, signal-integrity analysis of two coupled microstrip lines and noise coupling among multiple signal vias through a power-ground plane pair, are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data mining method in signal-integrity optimization design.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2014.2306957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/6845385/06755486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2014.2306957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6845385","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Integrity Optimization for Complicated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networks Based on Data Mining of S-Parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal-Integrity Optimization for Complicated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networks Based on Data Mining of S-Parameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14400843","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6755486/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Program of Guangzhou Zhujiang Star of Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Sysung-Etri Project"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Leaning-Research-Production Project","grantNumber":"2012B090600009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-Integrity Optimization for Complicated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networks Based on Data Mining of S-Parameters","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-zhang-2306957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13734S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6845385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6845385","articleId":"6755486","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6755493,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangnan Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6960135/6755493/zhong-2305841-small.gif","p":["Xiangnan Zhong received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in automation and control from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The method is to develop upper and lower bounds that are a function of the maximum dimension of the linear subspaces spanned by the Gaussian mixture components. The method not only reveals the existence or absence of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error floor (phase transition) but also provides insight into the MMSE decay via multivariate generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset, which are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of the kernel and the Gaussian mixture. These results apply not only to standard linear random Gaussian measurements but also to linear kernels that minimize the MMSE. It is shown that optimal kernels do not change the number of measurements associated with the MMSE phase transition, rather they affect the sensed power required to achieve a target MMSE in the low-noise regime. Overall, our bounds are tighter and sharper than standard bounds on the minimum number of measurements needed to recover sparse signals associated with a union of subspaces model, as they are not asymptotic in the signal dimension or signal sparsity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2309560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2309560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","startPage":"2265","endPage":"2277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06755542.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Covariance matrices","Vectors","Image reconstruction","Phase measurement","Noise measurement","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian processes","least mean squares methods","mixture models","optimisation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction","Gaussian mixture model","noisy compressive measurements","linear subspaces","minimum mean squared error","MMSE error floor","MMSE decay","MMSE power offset","linear random Gaussian measurements","linear kernels","optimal kernels","MMSE phase transition","sparse signals","signal dimension"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Gaussian mixtures","reconstruction","classification","MMSE","MMSE decay","MMSE power offset","phase transition","kernel design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Signals Drawn From a Gaussian Mixture Via Noisy Compressive Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"9","publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14219734","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6755542/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755542/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Signals Drawn From a Gaussian Mixture Via Noisy Compressive Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsp-renna-2309560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126641S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6755542","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":6755543,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this paper, we consider the use of a high-speed spiral imaging technique with an improved multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) scheme with a damping compensator for faster scanning by an AFM. The controller's design is based on an identified MIMO model of the AFM's piezoelectric tube scanner (PTS) and it achieves a higher closed-loop bandwidth, significant damping of the resonant mode of the PTS, and reduces the cross-coupling effect between the PTS's axes. The spirals produced have particularly narrow-band frequency measures which change slowly over time, thereby making it possible for the scanner to achieve improved tracking and continuous high-speed scanning rather than being restricted to the back and forth motion of raster scanning. To evaluate the performance improvement using this proposed control scheme for spiral scanning, an experimental comparison of its scanned images with those of the open-loop condition is performed. Experimental results show that, by using the proposed method, the AFM's scanning speed is significantly increased up to 180 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2014.2309653","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6810833/06755548.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2014.2309653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","startPage":"541","endPage":"550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiral Scanning With Improved Control for Faster Imaging of AFM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spiral Scanning With Improved Control for Faster Imaging of AFM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755548/","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6755548/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14281967","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiral Scanning With Improved Control for Faster Imaging of AFM","sourcePdf":"tnano-rana-2309653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083118S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6810833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6810833","articleId":"6755548","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6755554,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Ajoudani","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, via Morego 30, 16163 Genoa, Liguria, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4543165/6840878/6755554/6755554-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Ajoudani is a PhD candidate in Advanced Robotics Department, Italian Institute of Technology and \u201cE.

With the aim to realize a robust, efficient and low-cost hand prosthesis design, the SoftHand is developed based on the motor control principle of synergies, through which the immense complexity of the hand is simplified into distinct motor patterns. Due to the built-in flexibility of the hand joints, as the SoftHand grasps, it follows a synergistic path while allowing grasping of objects of various shapes using only a single motor. The DC motor of the hand incorporates a novel teleimpedance control in which the user's postural and stiffness synergy references are tracked in real-time. In addition, for intuitive control of the hand, two tactile interfaces are developed. The first interface (mechanotactile) exploits a disturbance observer which estimates the interaction forces in contact with the grasped object. Estimated interaction forces are then converted and applied to the upper arm of the user via a custom made pressure cuff. The second interface employs vibrotactile feedback based on surface irregularities and acceleration signals and is used to provide the user with information about the surface properties of the object as well as detection of object slippage while grasping. Grasp robustness and intuitiveness of hand control were evaluated in two sets of experiments. Results suggest that incorporating the aforementioned haptic feedback strategies, together with user-driven compliance of the hand, facilitate execution of safe and stable grasps, while suggesting that a low-cost, robust hand employing hardware-based synergies might be a good alternative to traditional myoelectric prostheses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Teleimpedance and Tactile Feedback for Intuitive Control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","doi":"10.1109/TOH.2014.2309142","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","pdfPath":"/iel7/4543165/6840878/06755554.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2014.2309142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Teleimpedance and Tactile Feedback for Intuitive Control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6755554/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2014","publicationDate":"April-June 2014","accessionNumber":"14397031","pubMedId":"24968383","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Teleimpedance and Tactile Feedback for Intuitive Control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand","sourcePdf":"toh-ajoudani-2309142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095735S","chronDate":"April-June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4543165","isNumber":"6840878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4543165","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6840878","articleId":"6755554","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6755574,"authors":[{"name":"Chaowen Shen","affiliation":["College of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6863726/6755574/6755574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chaowen Shen received the M.E. degree in signal and information processing from Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Based on the anti-control principle of continuous-time systems, a nominal system of n (n \u2265 5) independent first-order linear differential equations are coupled through all state variables, making the controlled system be in a closed-loop cascade-coupling form, where each equation contains only two state variables therefore the system is quite simple. Based on this setting, a simple model for dissipative hyperchaotic systems is constructed, with an adjustable parameter which can ensure the dissipation of the system. In the closed-loop cascade-coupling form, it is shown that all the eigenvalues are symmetrically distributed in a circumferential manner. Consequently, a universal law is derived on the relationship of the number of positive Lyapunov exponents and the number of positive real parts of its Jacobian eigenvalues. For the above-mentioned simple model, the number of positive Lyapunov exponents for any n-dimensional dissipative hyperchaotic system is given by N = round((n-1)/2), n \u2265 5. Therefore, in theory, the system can generate any desired number of positive Lyapunov exponents as long as the dimension of the system is sufficiently high. Thus, the proposed method provides a new approach for purposefully constructing desirable dissipative hyperchaotic systems. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Hyperchaotic Systems With <newline/>Any Desired Number of Positive Lyapunov <newline/>Exponents via A Simple Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2304655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6863726/06755574.pdf","startPage":"2380","endPage":"2389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2304655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6863726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Designing Hyperchaotic Systems With <newline/>Any Desired Number of Positive Lyapunov <newline/>Exponents via A Simple Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6755574/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469761","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61025017, 11072254, 61172023 and 61203148"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Hyperchaotic Systems With <newline/>Any Desired Number of Positive Lyapunov <newline/>Exponents via A Simple Model","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lu-2304655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096224S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6863726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6863726","articleId":"6755574","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6755579,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6863726/6755579/6755579-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Liu (S'10\u2013M'12) received the B.S. degree in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in 2010 from Fudan University, Shanghai, China.","From January 2010 to April 2010, he was with the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, USA, as a Visiting Scholar.

The detector is evolved from our previously developed imbalanced fixed complexity sphere decoder and adopts several new algorithm-level techniques to exploit the available a priori information of transmitted bits. More specifically, an adaptive tree-travel control scheme, a reliability-dependent log-likelihood ratio correction method and an iteration-based hybrid node enumeration technique are proposed to provide near-optimal detection performance with much reduced computational complexity. A multi-stage parallel VLSI architecture is developed to implement the proposed algorithm with high detection throughput. Furthermore, the block-level clock gating is deployed to save power when the tree-search space is reduced, while still preserving the constant-throughput feature.

The approach is based on a combined coefficient selection and shift-and-add implementation (CCSSI) for the design of the rotators. First, complete freedom is given to the selection of the coefficients, i.e., no constraints to the coefficients are set in advance and all the alternatives are taken into account. Second, the shift-and-add implementation uses advanced single constant multiplication (SCM) and multiple constant multiplication (MCM) techniques that lead to low-complexity multiplierless implementations. Third, the design of the rotators is done by a joint optimization of the coefficient selection and shift-and-add implementation. As a result, the CCSSI provides an extended design space that offers a larger number of alternatives with respect to previous works. Furthermore, the design space is explored in a simple and efficient way. The proposed approach has wide applications in numerous hardware scenarios. This includes rotations by single or multiple angles, rotators in single or multiple branches, and different scaling of the outputs. Experimental results for various scenarios are provided. In all of them, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements with respect to state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2304664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2304664","startPage":"2002","endPage":"2012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6842725/06755582.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Multiplierless Constant Rotators Based on Combined Coefficient Selection and Shift-and-Add Implementation (CCSSI)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Multiplierless Constant Rotators Based on Combined Coefficient Selection and Shift-and-Add Implementation (CCSSI)","volume":"61","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14415248","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6755582/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Multiplierless Constant Rotators Based on Combined Coefficient Selection and Shift-and-Add Implementation (CCSSI)","sourcePdf":"tcsi-garrido-2304664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.196444S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6842725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6842725","articleId":"6755582","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6755585,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mahdi Ashabani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Seyed Mahdi Ashabani was born in Isfahan, Iran.

The paper also provides a general and computationally-efficient framework for modeling and analysis of power management strategies in a microgrid with multiple-distributed generation (DG) units which eases microgrid dynamic studies and controller parameters selection in large microgrids with multiple DG units. Three different approaches for real and reactive power management are proposed. The controllers offer the following advantages: 1) the proposed topologies can be applied to both voltage-controlled (VC) and current controlled (CC) voltage source converters (VSCs). 2) The controllers are universal and realize requirements of both grid-connected and islanded modes, i.e., they share real and reactive power during islanding with constant frequency operation and act as grid supporting VSCs in the grid connected mode. 3) The drooping variables can be either power or current, thus VC-power drooping, VC-current drooping and CC-power drooping are different available variants. 4) The concept of hybrid polar-vector control is developed in this paper. Thus, it can combine the benefits of both types of controllers in one augmented strategy. 5) The controller emulates the behavior of conventional synchronous generators (SGs) which in turn results in better integration of electronically-interfaced DG units into the power system and prevents instabilities due to interaction of fast response DGs and SGs. 6) The controllers realize seamless and robust transition to the islanding mode. The controllers are developed under new concept of synchronous converters. A theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed controllers yield the aforementioned requirements in one compact structure.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2306016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6879345/06755585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2306016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6879345","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Family of Microgrid Control and Management Strategies in Smart Distribution Grids\u2014Analysis, Comparison and Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Family of Microgrid Control and Management Strategies in Smart Distribution Grids\u2014Analysis, Comparison and Testing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525637","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6755585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Family of Microgrid Control and Management Strategies in Smart Distribution Grids\u2014Analysis, Comparison and Testing","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ashabani-2306016-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1218S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6879345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6879345","articleId":"6755585","onlineDate":"04 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6755599,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard P.

Finally, the image is segmented by assigning each pixel to the cluster with the highest membership. The method was validated on both synthetic and in vivo ultrasound images.

Compared to the existing consumer depth and light field cameras, our camera is easy to construct with minimal additional costs and our design is camera and lens agnostic. The main advantage of our design is the ease of switching between an SLR camera and a native resolution depth/light field camera. Using an external mask is an important advantage over current light field camera designs since we do not need to modify the internals of the camera or the lens. Our camera sequentially acquires the angular components of the light field of a static scene by changing the location of the aperture in the mask. A consequence of our design is that the external aperture causes heavy vignetting in the acquired images. We calibrate the mask parameters and estimate multi-view scene depth under vignetting. In addition to depth, we show light field applications such as refocusing and defocus blur at the sensor resolution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755877.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.12","startPage":"37","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"External Mask Based Depth and Light Field Camera","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755877/","displayDocTitle":"External Mask Based Depth and Light Field Camera","htmlLink":"/document/6755877/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14147885","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"External Mask Based Depth and Light Field Camera","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073425S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6755878,"authors":[{"name":"Ewa Piatkowska","affiliation":["Safety and Security Department, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ewa","lastName":"Piatkowska","id":"37086013601"},{"name":"Ahmed Nabil Belbachir","affiliation":["Safety and Security Department, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ahmed Nabil","lastName":"Belbachir","id":"38267430200"},{"name":"Margrit Gelautz","affiliation":["Institute for Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Margrit","lastName":"Gelautz","id":"37267041100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755878","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Stereo vision","Cameras","Cooperative systems","Robot sensing systems","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","image reconstruction","image representation","image sensors","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous stereo vision","event-driven dynamic stereo sensor","adaptive cooperative approach","3D reconstruction","bioinspired depth camera","stereo dynamic vision sensor","DVS","self-spiking pixels","temporal resolution","sparse data representation","frame-based camera","depth calculation","spatiotemporal data","asynchronous data","event-driven stereo algorithm","cooperative network","recent activity","spatiotemporal context","disparity calculation","spatiotemporal aspect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous stereo vision","asynchronous depth camera","dynamic vision sensor","cooperative network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Stereo Vision for Event-Driven Dynamic Stereo Sensor Using an Adaptive Cooperative Approach","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive cooperative approach towards the 3D reconstruction tailored for a bio-inspired depth camera: the stereo dynamic vision sensor (DVS). DVS consists of self-spiking pixels that asynchronously generate events upon relative light intensity changes. These sensors have the advantage to allow simultaneously high temporal resolution (better than 10\u03bcs) and wide dynamic range (>120dB) at sparse data representation, which is not possible with frame-based cameras. In order to exploit the potential of DVS and benefit from its features, depth calculation should take into account the spatiotemporal and asynchronous aspect of data provided by the sensor. This work deals with developing an appropriate approach for the asynchronous, event-driven stereo algorithm. We propose a modification of the cooperative network in which the history of the recent activity in the scene is stored to serve as spatiotemporal context used in disparity calculation for each incoming event. The network constantly evolves in time - as events are generated. In our work, not only the spatiotemporal aspect of the data is preserved but also the matching is performed asynchronously. The results of the experiments prove that the proposed approach is well suited for DVS data and can be successfully used for our efficient passive depth camera.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.13","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.13","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755878.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2013

The recent surge in the number of publications on tracking-related problems have made it almost impossible to follow the developments in the field. One of the reasons is that there is a lack of commonly accepted annotated data-sets and standardized evaluation protocols that would allow objective comparison of different tracking methods. To address this issue, the Visual Object Tracking (VOT) workshop was organized in conjunction with ICCV2013. Researchers from academia as well as industry were invited to participate in the first VOT2013 challenge which aimed at single-object visual trackers that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (model-free). Presented here is the VOT2013 benchmark dataset for evaluation of single-object visual trackers as well as the results obtained by the trackers competing in the challenge. In contrast to related attempts in tracker benchmarking, the dataset is labeled per-frame by visual attributes that indicate occlusion, illumination change, motion change, size change and camera motion, offering a more systematic comparison of the trackers. Furthermore, we have designed an automated system for performing and evaluating the experiments. We present the evaluation protocol of the VOT2013 challenge and the results of a comparison of 27 trackers on the benchmark dataset. The dataset, the evaluation tools and the tracker rankings are publicly available from the challenge website (http://votchallenge.net).","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.20","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755885.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Visual Object Tracking VOT2013 Challenge Results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755885/","displayDocTitle":"The Visual Object Tracking VOT2013 Challenge Results","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147956","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755885/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Visual Object Tracking VOT2013 Challenge Results","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.179775S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6755887,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Felsberg","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Felsberg","id":"37398283600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755887","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Histograms","Kernel","Ash","Robustness","Accuracy","Gray-scale"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","estimation theory","image motion analysis","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution field tracking","channel representation","visual object tracking","lighting condition","grayscale sequences","averaged shifted histogram","kernel density estimates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visual tracking","distribution field","channel representation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Distribution Field Tracking Using Channel Representations","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.22","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755887.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.22","abstract":"Visual tracking of objects under varying lighting conditions and changes of the object appearance, such as articulation and change of aspect, is a challenging problem.

The image dataset was collected and made available to us by biologists for the purposes of morphological studies of corals, jellyfish, and other species in the phylum Cnidaria. Challenges for computer vision presented by this biological domain are rarely seen in general images of natural scenes. We formulate nematocyst detection as labeling of a regular grid of image patches. This structured prediction problem is specified within two frameworks: CRF and HC-Search. The CRF uses graph cuts for inference. The HC-Search approach is based on search in the space of outputs. It uses a learned heuristic function (H) to uncover high-quality candidate labelings of image patches, and then uses a learned cost function (C) to select the final prediction among the candidates. While locally optimal CRF inference may be sufficient for images of natural scenes, our results demonstrate that CRF with graph cuts performs poorly on the nematocyst images, and that HC-Search outperforms CRF with graph cuts. This suggests biological images of flexible objects present new challenges requiring further ad- vances of, or alternatives to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.32","startPage":"190","endPage":"196","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755897.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Detect Basal Tubules of Nematocysts in SEM Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Detect Basal Tubules of Nematocysts in SEM Images","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755897/","accessionNumber":"14147902","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755897/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Detect Basal Tubules of Nematocysts in SEM Images","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055014S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6755901,"authors":[{"name":"Uwe Franke","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Franke","id":"37283450400"},{"name":"David Pfeiffer","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Pfeiffer","id":"37544768600"},{"name":"Clemens Rabe","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Rabe","id":"37541627500"},{"name":"Carsten Knoeppel","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Knoeppel","id":"37565241900"},{"name":"Markus Enzweiler","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Enzweiler","id":"37300177700"},{"name":"Fridtjof Stein","affiliation":["Daimler AG - Research & Development, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Fridtjof","lastName":"Stein","id":"37374673600"},{"name":"Ralf G.

This raises hope for a fast evolution of autonomous driving that also extends to rural and urban traffic situations. In August 2013, an S-Class vehicle with close-to-production sensors drove completely autonomously for about 100 km from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, following the well-known historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route. Next-generation stereo vision was the main sensing component and as such formed the basis for the indispensable comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations, which are typical for narrow European villages. This successful experiment has proved both the maturity and the significance of machine vision for autonomous driving. This paper presents details of the employed vision algorithms for object recognition and tracking, free-space analysis, traffic light recognition, lane recognition, as well as self-localization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making Bertha See","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.36","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755901.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Making Bertha See","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755901/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147968","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making Bertha See","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059798S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6755908,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Savchynskyy","affiliation":["University of Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Savchynskyy","id":"37945379800"},{"name":"Stefan Schmidt","affiliation":["University of Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37951592200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755908","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Convergence","Vectors","Approximation methods","Linear programming","Entropy","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","convergence","gradient methods","Markov processes","optimisation","random processes","relaxation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feasible variable estimates","MRF local polytope","approximate feasible primal solutions","large-scale optimization problems","separability properties","infeasible primal estimates","dual function subgradients","primal feasible set","problem complexity","convergence","Euclidean projection","local polytope relaxation","inference problems","Markov random fields"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["markov random fields","graphical models","MAP inference","LP relaxation","feasible primal solution","duality gap"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a method for the construction of approximate feasible primal solutions from infeasible ones for large-scale optimization problems possessing certain separability properties. Whereas the infeasible primal estimates can typically be produced from (sub-) gradients of the dual function, it is often not easy to project them to the primal feasible set, since the projection itself has a complexity comparable to the complexity of the initial problem. We propose an alternative efficient method to obtain feasibility and show that its properties influencing the convergence to the optimum are similar to the properties of the Euclidean projection. We apply our method to the local polytope relaxation of inference problems for Markov Random Fields and discuss its advantages over existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.43","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755908.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Getting Feasible Variable Estimates from Infeasible Ones: MRF Local Polytope Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Getting Feasible Variable Estimates from Infeasible Ones: MRF Local Polytope Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755908/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147986","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Getting Feasible Variable Estimates from Infeasible Ones: MRF Local Polytope Study","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124444S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6755919,"authors":[{"name":"Tadas Baltrusaitis","affiliation":["University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"],"firstName":"Tadas","lastName":"Baltrusaitis","id":"37071444700"},{"name":"Peter Robinson","affiliation":["University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Robinson","id":"37331855300"},{"name":"Louis-Philippe Morency","affiliation":["USC Institute for Creative Technologies, Waterfront Drive"],"firstName":"Louis-Philippe","lastName":"Morency","id":"37333320600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755919","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Computational modeling","Vectors","Shape","Lighting","Optimization","Facial features"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","neural nets","optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained local neural fields","robust facial landmark detection","facial feature detection algorithms","lighting conditions","constrained local neural field model","probabilistic patch expert","landmark detector","nonlinear relationship","spatial relationship","landmark probability","nonuniform regularised landmark mean-shift optimisation technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["facial landmark detection","deformable models","in the wild"]}],"abstract":"Facial feature detection algorithms have seen great progress over the recent years.

Secondly, our model is optimised using a novel Non-uniform Regularised Landmark Mean-Shift optimisation technique, which takes into account the reliabilities of each patch expert.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been successfully utilized in facial landmark localization for two-fold advantages: 1) geometric constraints among facial points are implicitly utilized, 2) huge amount of training data can be leveraged. However, in the task of extensive facial landmark localization, a large number of facial landmarks (more than 50 points) are required to be located in a unified system, which poses great difficulty in the structure design and training process of traditional convolutional networks. In this paper, we design a four-level convolutional network cascade, which tackles the problem in a coarse-to-fine manner. In our system, each network level is trained to locally refine a subset of facial landmarks generated by previous network levels. In addition, each level predicts explicit geometric constraints (the position and rotation angles of a specific facial component) to rectify the inputs of the current network level. The combination of coarse-to-fine cascade and geometric refinement enables our system to locate extensive facial landmarks (68 points) accurately in the 300-W facial landmark localization challenge.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755923.pdf","endPage":"391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extensive Facial Landmark Localization with Coarse-to-Fine Convolutional Network Cascade","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.58","startPage":"386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Extensive Facial Landmark Localization with Coarse-to-Fine Convolutional Network Cascade","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755923/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147909","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6755923/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extensive Facial Landmark Localization with Coarse-to-Fine Convolutional Network Cascade","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066221S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6755924,"authors":[{"name":"Junjie Yan","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Yan","id":"37071054400"},{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Lei","id":"37405947900"},{"name":"Dong Yi","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yi","id":"37603108600"},{"name":"Stan Z.

We build our method on cascade regression framework, where a series of regressors are utilized to progressively refine the shape initialized by face detector. In cascade regression, we use the HOG feature in a multi-scale manner, where the large pose validation is handled in early stages by HOG feature at large scale, and then shape is refined at later stages with HOG feature at small scale. We observe that the performance of the cascade regression method decreases when the initialization provided by face detector is not accurate enough (for faces with large appearance variations, face detection is still a challenging problem). To handle the problem, we propose to generate multiple hypotheses, and then learn to rank or combine these hypotheses to get the final result. The parameters in both learn to rank and learn to combine can be learned in a structural SVM framework. Despite the simplicity of our method, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on LFPW, and dramatically outperforms the baseline AAM on the 300-W challenge.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755924.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learn to Combine Multiple Hypotheses for Accurate Face Alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Shape","Silicon","Training","Face detection","Detectors","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","pose estimation","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple hypothesis combination","face alignment","faces in-the-wild challenge","cascade regression framework","regressor series","face detector","HOG feature","pose validation","face detection","learn to rank","structural SVM framework","LFPW","baseline AAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face alignment","landmark","Cascade Regression","Structural SVM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Learn to Combine Multiple Hypotheses for Accurate Face Alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755924/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147892","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learn to Combine Multiple Hypotheses for Accurate Face Alignment","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054097S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":6755925,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Sagonas","affiliation":["Comp.

In extensive experiments on existing and newly proposed datasets, we show our 3D object representations outperform their state-of-the-art 2D counterparts for fine-grained categorization and demonstrate their efficacy for estimating 3D geometry from images via ultra-wide baseline matching and 3D reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.77","startPage":"554","endPage":"561","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755945/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147979","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6755945/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108245S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"590","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6755953,"authors":[{"name":"Hang-Bong Kang","affiliation":["Dept. of Digital Media, Catholic University of Korea"],"firstName":"Hang-Bong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37291403300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Feature extraction","Monitoring","Accidents","Visualization","Head","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","behavioural sciences computing","decision making","driver information systems","ergonomics","physiology","road accidents","road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver drowsiness detection","driver distraction","accidents","driver perception level","driver decision making capability","vehicle control","driver monitoring","driving behavior monitoring","monitoring methods","unsafe driving behavior prediction","measurement methods","nonvisual features","driving performance behaviors","vehicle-based features","visual feature measurements","eye related measurements","yawning detection","facial expression","physiological signals","steering wheel movement","standard deviation","lateral position","head pose","gaze direction methods","car dynamics","driver safety systems","hybrid measures","driving context awareness","driving conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver drowsiness monitoring","Driving behavior monitoring","Unsafe driving behavior prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755953","abstract":"In recent years, driver drowsiness and distraction have been important factors in a large number of accidents because they reduce driver perception level and decision making capability, which negatively affect the ability to control the vehicle. One way to reduce these kinds of accidents would be through monitoring driver and driving behavior and alerting the driver when they are drowsy or in a distracted state. In addition, if it were possible to predict unsafe driving behavior in advance, this would also contribute to safe driving. In this paper, we will discuss various monitoring methods for driver and driving behavior as well as for predicting unsafe driving behaviors. In respect to measurement methods of driver drowsiness, we discussed visual and non-visual features of driver behavior, as well as driving performance behaviors related to vehicle-based features. Visual feature measurements such as eye related measurements, yawning detection, facial expression are discussed in detail. As for non-visual features, we explore various physiological signals and possible drowsiness detection methods that use these signals. As for vehicle-based features, we describe steering wheel movement and the standard deviation of lateral position. To detect driver distraction, we describe head pose and gaze direction methods. To predict unsafe driving behavior, we explain predicting methods based on facial expressions and car dynamics. Finally, we discuss several issues to be tackled for active driver safety systems. They are 1) hybrid measures for drowsiness detection, 2) driving context awareness for safe driving, 3) the necessity for public data sets of simulated and real driving conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2013.85","startPage":"616","endPage":"623","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2013.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755862","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751566/6755862/06755953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Various Approaches for Driver and Driving Behavior Monitoring: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6755953/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Various Approaches for Driver and Driving Behavior Monitoring: A Review","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6755953/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14147965","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Various Approaches for Driver and Driving Behavior Monitoring: A Review","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3022a616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083571S","chronDate":"2-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6751566","isNumber":"6755862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751566","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6755862","articleId":"6755953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6755969,"authors":[{"name":"Georgia Sandbach","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Sandbach","id":"38075730000"},{"name":"Stefanos Zafeiriou","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Zafeiriou","id":"37299691200"},{"name":"Maja Pantic","affiliation":["EEMCS, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Pantic","id":"37086790925"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3022-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6755969","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"We present a novel Markov Random Field (MRF) structure-based approach to the problem of facial action unit (AU) intensity estimation.

The main advantages of LSH lie in constant detection time, low memory requirement, and simple implementation. However, since the metric of distance in LSHs does not consider the property of normal training data, a naive use of existing LSHs would not perform well. In this paper, we propose a new hashing scheme so that hash functions are selected dependently on the properties of the normal training data for reliable anomaly detection. The distance metric of the proposed method, called NSH (Normality Sensitive Hashing) is theoretically interpreted in terms of the region of normal training data and its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on real-world data.

a redistribution layer (RDL) technology. To realize a low-loss passive circuit, we introduced a multi-metal-layer for the RDL. The first metal layer was used as ground to shield from substrates. The upper metal layers form passive RF components such as a thin film microstrip line (TFMSL), a spiral inductor, a balun, a power combiner, and an antenna. Detailed measurements and characterizations are presented, and we show their applicability in the millimeter-wave region. Moreover, this concept was applied to an integrating millimeter-wave module consisting of four identical CMOS power amplifiers and RDL power combiners to increase the output power.

In most cases the MPD launched from the optical transmitter is significantly transformed before reaching the receiver due to a number of factors, i.e. mode conversion and mode dispersion along the fiber and the various components inserted in the optical path. In order to secure the minimum received optical power and desired bandwidth at the receiver, we propose using the concept of \u201cTotal MPD management\u201d for all interfaces in the transmission line. To implement this concept, a method of specifying requirements to the device side from the specifications on the system side is needed. Although rapid changes in MPD arise, especially in SI-MMFs, there is no universal means of quantifying this. In this paper, we define a simple quantification method for MPD which we have named the \u201cencircled angular flux (EAF)\u201d, and which can be used to accurately design optical systems (FFP-based). Moreover, this EAF acts as a fundamental parameter for the design, mounting and evaluation of optical components and can provide the specifications required for connecting to a network. We expect the use of \u201cTotal MPD management\u201d and \u201cIEC standardization\u201d will generate interest in related institutions and suppliers worldwide.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6756101/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147036","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modal power distribution in short reach optical communications using step-index-type multimode optical fibers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal power distribution in short reach optical communications using step-index-type multimode optical fibers","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"102ManabuKagami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053493S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746870","isNumber":"6756068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746870","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6756068","articleId":"6756101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6756153,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Baluns and balun boards used in our measurements have the parasitic common-mode capacitances, ranging from 1.1 to 32 pF, which affects the measured transmission level of the IBC channel, leading to a significant difference of about 40 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2013.6756245","doi":"10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2013.6756245","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746334/6756132/06756245.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on RF and Wireless Technologies for Biomedical and Healthcare Applications (IMWS-BIO)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on RF and Wireless Technologies for Biomedical and Healthcare Applications (IMWS-BIO)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756245/","displayDocTitle":"Balun's effect on the measurement of transmission characteristics for intrabody communication channel","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14146686","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6756245/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balun's effect on the measurement of transmission characteristics for intrabody communication channel","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WA42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044668S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746334","isNumber":"6756132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746334","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6756132","articleId":"6756245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6756267,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Since last decade compressive sensing is evolving which shows the signal reconstruction ability from insufficient data points. It reconstructs the signal from a set of reduced number of sparse samples that is lesser than Nyquist rate. It is required that the signal should be sparse in some basis. In wavelet domain, electrocardiogram signal shows sparseness. This paper suggests applying compressive sensing at wavelet scales. Also, the number of measurements taken at wavelet scales plays important role for successful reconstruction and to capture the maximum diagnostic information of electrocardiogram signal. At wavelet scales, the numbers of measurements are taken based on multiscale entropy. At scales, it uses random sensing matrix with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries formed by sampling a Gaussian distribution. The compressed measurements are encoded using Huffman coding scheme. The reconstruction of signal is achieved by convex optimization problem by L1-norm minimization. Reconstruction error introduced due to L1-norm minimization and coding is evaluated using percentage root mean square difference (PRD), wavelet energy based diagnostic distortion (WEDD), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized maximum amplitude error (NMAX) and maximum absolute error (MAE). The highest compression ratio value is found 6.92:1 with PRD and WEDD values 8.18% and 2.33% respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICTKE.2013.6756267","publicationTitle":"2013 Eleventh International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Eleventh International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745897/6756263/06756267.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTKE.2013.6756267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale entropy based compressive sensing for electrocardiogram signal compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756267/","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale entropy based compressive sensing for electrocardiogram signal compression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146634","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6756267/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale entropy based compressive sensing for electrocardiogram signal compression","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"32212951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063477S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745897","isNumber":"6756263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745897","xplore-issue":"6756263","articleId":"6756267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6756297,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, due to its high cost and yield problems, it has not been used widely. Nevertheless, TSV is becoming a main stream interconnect method for CIS (CMOS image sensors) packaging. In order to assess the reliability behavior of typical CMOS image sensor such as delamination during CIS packaging and reliability testing, CSP packages are subjected to JEDEC reliability test to identify the failure modes and failure locations. According to the subsequent cross-section analysis, delamination occurs between the bonding attach and oxide layer. The glass crack after reliability test is observed, the crack propagates from the interface between the glass and cavity wall into the interior of the glass. Regarding the experimental results, a plane strain finite element model (FEM) is established to study the underlying mechanisms of reliability problems. According to the FEM results, the maximum shear stress in cavity wall occurs at the outside interface between cavity wall and the glass. The maximum shear stress in bonding attach occurs at the outside interface between the bonding attach and oxide layer. Besides, the maximum stress occurs in the low-temperature phase, which is correlated well with the SEM results. Based on the FEM analysis, the influence of geometric parameters such as the height and width of cavity wall, the thickness of the backside SMF, the thickness of silicon are also investigated to develop the guidelines for CIS packaging design.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2013.6756522","publicationTitle":"2013 14th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 14th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745316/6756403/06756522.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2013.6756522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delamination analysis and reliability design for CMOS image sensors packages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756522/","displayDocTitle":"Delamination analysis and reliability design for CMOS image sensors packages","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14146331","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6756522/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delamination analysis and reliability design for CMOS image sensors packages","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"C26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150743S","chronDate":"11-14 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745316","isNumber":"6756403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745316","xplore-issue":"6756403","articleId":"6756522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6756641,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Jingkai","affiliation":["Hebei Semiconductor Research Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Jingkai","id":"37086729620"},{"name":"Gao Ling","affiliation":["Hebei Semiconductor Research Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Ling","id":"37085405961"},{"name":"Ji Chunfeng","affiliation":["Hebei Semiconductor Research Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Chunfeng","id":"38196960500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0498-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6756641","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Fatigue","Thermal stresses","Aluminum oxide","Electronic packaging thermal management","Finite element analysis","Soldering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alumina","aluminium alloys","ceramic packaging","creep","finite element analysis","lead alloys","reliability","silver alloys","solders","stress-strain relations","thermal management (packaging)","thermal stress cracking","tin alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["package design","electronic industry","flat-lead structure","solder volume","thermal fatigue life","stress relaxation","creep deformation","corner solder joint","solder joints","stress-strain distribution","ANSYS software","3D finite element method","thermal cycling loading conditions","ceramic quad flat package","reliability analysis","SnPb37","AgCu28","Al2O3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element","CQFP","Thermal fatigue life","Reliability"]}],"abstract":"ANSYS software was used to calculate the stress/strain distribution of ceramic quad flat package under thermal cycling.

Various base-station configurations, time of arrival, and first peak detection algorithms are used to estimate the position of the body-worn antennas. Localization error as small as 1-2 cm has been achieved using eight base stations, which is comparable to the measurement accuracy obtained by a complex optical motion capture system to determine the absolute displacement error. The localization error obtained is better by a third in comparison to common commercial system based on UWB technology. The results demonstrate that cuboid-shape configuration with four base stations gives slightly low average percentage error (2%-3%) in comparison to Y-shape (4%). However, the Y-shape configuration is more compact and provides setting-up simplicity, which makes it convenient for various applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to entertainment technologies either laboratory-based or in-home.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Base stations","Accuracy","Ultra wideband antennas","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","body sensor networks","time-of-arrival estimation","ultra wideband antennas","wearable antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable ultrawideband antenna localization","human body localization","UWB technology","base-station configuration","first peak detection algorithm","time of arrival algorithm","position estimation","body-worn antenna","measurement accuracy","complex optical motion capture system","absolute displacement error determination","cuboid-shape configuration","Y-shape configuration","healthcare monitoring","entertainment technology","sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","motion capture","ultrawideband"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2309977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06756933.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2309977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of Wearable Ultrawideband Antennas for Motion Capture Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization of Wearable Ultrawideband Antennas for Motion Capture Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756933/","volume":"13","publicationDate":"2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6756933/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14195011","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of Wearable Ultrawideband Antennas for Motion Capture Applications","sourcePdf":"lawp-bharadwaj-2309977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081142S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6756933","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6756937,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Uz Zaman","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, SE, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6756937/6756937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashraf Uz Zaman was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh.

Most existing works in the literature use (sub)gradient methods for solving the dual of this problem which can be implemented in a distributed manner. However, these (sub)gradient methods suffer from an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(1/\u221a\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n) rate of convergence (where k is the number of iterations). In this paper, we assume that the utility functions are strongly concave, an assumption satisfied by most standard utility functions considered in the literature. We develop a completely distributed fast gradient method for solving the dual of the NUM problem.

The driven element is mutually coupled to the parasitic elements and reactive loads are utilized to control the phase to achieve a particular beam scanning direction.

It aims to provide a more realistic breast acoustic model used for tumor inversion as the background by actively measuring and reconstructing the structural heterogeneity of human breast environment.

A few major issues of the L-DAS, such as high latency, energy consumption, computational complexity, and large feedback (signaling) overhead, are identified. The potential capability of the L-DAS is illuminated in terms of an energy efficiency (EE) throughout the paper. We firstly and generally model the power consumption of an L-DAS, and formulate an EE maximization problem. To tackle two crucial issues, namely the huge computational complexity and large amount of feedback (signaling) information, we propose a channel-gain-based antenna selection (AS) method and an interference-based user clustering (UC) method. The original problem is then split into multiple subproblems by a cluster, and each cluster's precoding and power control are managed in parallel for high EE. Simulation results reveal that i) using all antennas for zero-forcing multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is energy inefficient if there is nonnegligible overhead power consumption on MU-MIMO processing, and ii) increasing the number of antennas does not necessarily result in a high EE. Furthermore, the results validate and underpin the EE merit of the proposed L-DAS complied with the AS, UC, precoding, and power control by comparing with non-clustering L-DAS and colocated antenna systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal

challenge of learning to play many different video games with little domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, it introduces a neuroevolution approach to general Atari 2600 game playing. Four neuroevolution algorithms were paired with three different state representations and evaluated on a set of 61 Atari games. The neuroevolution agents represent different points along the spectrum of algorithmic sophistication - including weight evolution on topologically fixed neural networks (conventional neuroevolution), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT), and indirect network encoding (HyperNEAT). State representations include an object representation of the game screen, the raw pixels of the game screen, and seeded noise (a comparative baseline). Results indicate that direct-encoding methods work best on compact state representations while indirect-encoding methods (i.e., HyperNEAT) allow scaling to higher dimensional representations (i.e., the raw game screen). Previous approaches based on temporal-difference (TD) learning had trouble dealing with the large state spaces and sparse reward gradients often found in Atari games. Neuroevolution ameliorates these problems and evolved policies achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing human high scores on three games. These results suggest that neuroevolution is a promising approach to general video game playing (GVGP).","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2294713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel7/4804728/6982241/06756960.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2294713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neuroevolution Approach to General Atari Game Playing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Neuroevolution Approach to General Atari Game Playing","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824262","htmlLink":"/document/6756960/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-0917122, IIS-0915038 and DBI-0939454"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neuroevolution Approach to General Atari Game Playing","sourcePdf":"tciaig-hausknecht-2294713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165513S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"6982241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6982241","articleId":"6756960","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6756967,"authors":[{"name":"Shang Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York, NY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6856242/6756967/6756967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shang Li received the B.Sc. degree in electronics from Peking University, China, in 2010 and the M.Phil. degree in electronic and computer engineering (ECE) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, in 2012.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Columbia University, New York.

To prevent the damage caused by the intentional injection of dishonest ratings, termed as reputation attack, we aim to detect such attack as soon as possible after its occurrence by sequentially observing the rating samples at a single or multiple agents. We propose a discrete probability model to characterize the rating samples based on which the sequential change detection framework can be applied. First for the single-agent case, we develop a sequential attack detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) that is robust to a wide range of attacking strategies. Then, for the multi-agent case, where the distributed agents collect ratings and communicate with a central manager to make the decision, we propose a novel multi-agent sequential attack detector that can effectively exploit the different number of attacked agents to increase the detection speed, and exhibits a second-order asymptotic optimality for any given number of attacked agents if the rating distribution under attack can be specified. Finally, we propose a decentralized version of the multi-agent attack detector based on the level-triggered sampling of the local statistic at each agent, which essentially constitutes an adaptive transmission scheme between the distributed agents and the central manager. The decentralized detector incurs only a minor increase in detection delay compared with the centralized counterpart while substantially reduces the communication overhead for attack detection in the multi-agent reputation systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6856242/06756967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6856242","startPage":"653","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quickest Attack Detection in Multi-Agent Reputation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quickest Attack Detection in Multi-Agent Reputation Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450745","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6756967/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quickest Attack Detection in Multi-Agent Reputation Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-wang-2309943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085574S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6856242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6856242","articleId":"6756967","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6756970,"authors":[{"name":"Zongze Yuan","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zongze","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086636598"},{"name":"Hao Sun","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37535950300"},{"name":"Kefeng Ji","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kefeng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37665207100"},{"name":"Zhiyong Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085521625"},{"name":"Huanxin Zou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Huanxin","lastName":"Zou","id":"37675189900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6756970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Vectors","Dictionaries","Object detection","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local sparsity divergence","hyperspectral anomaly detection","low-dimensional subspaces","sliding dual-window strategy","sparse coefficients","hyperspectral imagery pixel","sparsity divergence index","joint segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection (AD)","hyperspectral imagery (HSI)","local sparsity divergence (LSD)","unsupervised"]},{"kwd":["Anomaly detection (AD)","hyperspectral imagery (HSI)","local sparsity divergence (LSD)","unsupervised"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection (AD) has increasingly become important in hyperspectral imagery (HSI) owing to its high spatial and spectral resolutions. Many anomaly detectors have been proposed, and most of them are based on a Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector, which assumes that the spectrum signature of HSI pixels can be modeled with Gaussian distributions. However, recent studies show that the Gaussian and other unimodal distributions are not a good fit to the data and often lead to many false alarms. This letter proposes a novel hyperspectral AD algorithm based on local sparsity divergence (LSD) without any distribution hypothesis. Our algorithm exploits the fact that targets and background lie in different low-dimensional subspaces and that targets cannot be effectively represented by their local surrounding background. A sliding dual-window strategy is first adopted to construct local spectral and spatial dictionaries, which enable the extraction of the sparse coefficients of each HSI pixel. Then, a consistent sparsity divergence index is proposed to compute the LSD map at each spectral band separately. Finally, joint segmentation of LSD maps over different bands is performed for AD. Experimental results on both simulated data and recorded data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2014.2306209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6814328/06756970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2014.2306209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814328","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Sparsity Divergence for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local Sparsity Divergence for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14299630","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6756970/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61303186 and 61240058"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20124307120013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Sparsity Divergence for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"lgrs-sun-2306209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06049S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6814328","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6814328","articleId":"6756970","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6756971,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Al-Rawi","affiliation":["Dept of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Al-Rawi","id":"37085613768"},{"name":"Ahmed Hussain","affiliation":["Dept of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37849270900"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["Dept of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280196300"},{"name":"Magnus Franz\u00e9n","affiliation":["Bluetest AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Franz\u00e9n","id":"37395698500"},{"name":"Charlie Orlenius","affiliation":["Bluetest AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Charlie","lastName":"Orlenius","id":"37266279200"},{"name":"Ahmed A.

The antenna is very compact with low correlation between ports and high diversity gain. The genetic algorithm optimization scheme has been employed in the design. Simulation results have been verified against measurements. The measured reflection coefficients at all ports are below -7 dB over 0.5-9 GHz and below -4.5 dB over 0.4-0.5 GHz and 9-15 GHz. The measured correlation coefficients are below 0.4 over 0.4-15 GHz and lower than 0.1 in most of the frequency band.

Together with power-controlled hand-off, it can mitigate the pilot contamination problem without the need for coordination among cells.

It is based on the theory of large random matrices that predicts that the eigenvalue spectra of large sample covariance matrices can asymptotically decompose into disjoint bulks as the matrix size grows large. Random matrix and free probability theory are utilized to predict under which system parameters such a bulk decomposition takes place.

The QZSDMC is formed by cascading the quasi-Z-source impedance network and the conventional direct matrix converter (DMC). The QZSDMC can provide buck-boost operation with voltage transfer ratio controlled by controlling the shoot-through duty ratio and bidirectional operation capability. The control strategy, which is based on the indirect field oriented control algorithm, is able to control the motor speed from zero to the rated value under full load condition during motoring and regenerating operation modes. The operating principle of the proposed system is presented in detail. The simulation and the real-time implementation results, using dSPACE 1103 ControlDesk, validate the high performance of the proposed four-quadrants IM-ASD based on QZSDMC system. The proposed four-quadrant vector controlled IM-ASD system based on the QZSDMC topology overcomes the voltage gain limitation of the traditional DMC and achieves buck and boost condition in four-quadrant modes with reduced number of switches, therefore achieving low cost, high efficiency, and reliability, compared with back-to-back

diseases, and outbreaks of infectious diseases are some of the major challenges of our present-day society. To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"61","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14238920","pubMedId":"24759283","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6756983/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unobtrusive Sensing and Wearable Devices for Health Informatics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unobtrusive Sensing and Wearable Devices for Health Informatics","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"tbme-zhang-2309951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.279743S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6800026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"444","xplore-issue":"6800026","articleId":"6756983","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6756984,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Lin Zhai","affiliation":["Key Lab of Ministry of Education of China for Research of Design and EMC of High Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085422327"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Center for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37278303000"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37335571800"},{"name":"Xiang-Hua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, The University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900807800"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634929500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6756984","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Digital signal processing","Reflection","Educational institutions","Perfectly matched layers","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","finite difference time-domain analysis","signal processing","waveguide couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfectly matched layer","WCS-FDTD method","DSP techniques","stretched coordinate PML","SC-PML","digital signal processing","WCS-FDTD lattices","PML equations","auxiliary quantities","convolutional PML","absorbing performance","computational expenditure","energy leakage","rectangular waveguide coupler","cross-slots","weakly conditional stable finite-difference time-domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processing (DSP) techniques","finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","stretched coordinate perfectly matched layer (SC-PML)","weakly conditional stable (WCS)"]}],"abstract":"An efficient implementation of perfectly matched layer (PML), based on the stretched coordinate PML (SC-PML) and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, is proposed to truncate the weakly conditional stable finite-difference time-domain (WCS-FDTD) lattices.

We propose an effective pilot contamination elimination scheme for multi-cell time division duplexing based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, by carefully designing a sophisticated amalgam of downlink (DL) training and `scheduled' uplink (UL) training. During the DL training stage, each base station (BS) transmits the DL pilot symbols (PSs) to its mobile stations (MSs) for them to estimate their frequency-domain channel transfer functions (FDCHTFs), which are then embedded in the UL PSs by `predistorting' the PSs with the estimated FDCHTFs. During the scheduled UL training, each BS's UL receiver in turn extracts the FDCHTFs of its MSs from their received PSs by eliminating the pilot contamination imposed by the simultaneously transmitted UL PSs of all other cells. Our simulation results demonstrate that the pilot contamination is completely eliminated by the proposed scheme, even for the network consisting of a large number of unity frequency reuse cells. Most significantly, unlike many existing pilot contamination reduction schemes, our scheme does not rely on the assumption that each BS knows the second-order statistics of all the interfering UL channels.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309936","startPage":"759","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06756990.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Contamination Elimination for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Aided OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Contamination Elimination for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Aided OFDM Systems","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14581806","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6756990/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301150, 61271421 and 61172086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Contamination Elimination for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Aided OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-hanzo-2309936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169176S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6756990","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6756993,"authors":[{"name":"Joan Enric Barcelo-Llado","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Systems Engineering Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6776454/6756993/barce-2309855-small.gif","p":["Joan Enric Barcel\u00f3-Llad\u00f3 received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Spain, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","In 2007, he was a Research Assistant with the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Siena, Italy, involved in the topics of cross-layer techniques for satellite networks.

In particular, we investigate the robustness of the AF-CS scheme in the presence of a group of coordinated eavesdropping nodes under the assumption that they have corrupted channel state information. In order to fulfil this assumption, we propose a channel estimation technique based on pseudorandom pilots. This technique introduces extra uncertainty only in the channel estimation of the eavesdroppers. Our simulation results evaluate the physical-layer protection as a function of the total number of coordinated eavesdroppers and the level of channel estimation distortion of the eavesdroppers. We demonstrate that a small number of eavesdroppers (small being defined later on) has a zero probability of recovering the intended signal. We also show that a very large number of eavesdropping nodes are required to perfectly recover the signal in comparison with other distributed compressed sensing schemes in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as a Physical-Layer Secrecy Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309855","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6776454/06756993.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as a Physical-Layer Secrecy Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6756993/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14235932","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as a Physical-Layer Secrecy Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-barcelollado-2309855-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127073S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6776454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6776454","articleId":"6756993","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6756995,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Grupo de Sistemas Electr\u00f3nicos de Alimentaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6917239/6756995/6756995-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Rodr\u00edguez (M\u201913) was born in Oviedo, Spain, in 1981.

One of the advantages of the DAB is the possibility to achieve the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation in all the switches of this converter. However, the ZVS operation range can be lost for light loads, especially if high voltage is required in at least one of the DAB ports and the phase-shift control is used to regulate the power processed by the converter. Theoretically simple averaged and small-signal models are presented for the DAB converter. Using the study presented in this paper, the boundaries of the ZVS operation can be easily evaluated. The proposed models and analysis of the ZVS boundaries allow the proposal and evaluation of two different design strategies with different purposes: on the one hand, increasing the ZVS operation range and, on the other, improving efficiency at full load. Moreover, some techniques are presented for increasing the ZVS operation range and improving the efficiency of the DAB at full load (both using phase-shift control) employing the aforementioned analysis to obtain certain design criteria and conclusions. Finally, the proposed models, design strategies, and techniques to improve the performance of the DAB are experimentally tested using a 1-kW prototype with input and output voltages of 48 and 400 V, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Different Purpose Design Strategies and Techniques to Improve the Performance of a Dual Active Bridge With Phase-Shift Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2309853","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6917239/06756995.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2309853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6756995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Different Purpose Design Strategies and Techniques to Improve the Performance of a Dual Active Bridge With Phase-Shift Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6756995/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14648216","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Different Purpose Design Strategies and Techniques to Improve the Performance of a Dual Active Bridge With Phase-Shift Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-rodriguez-2309853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081827S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6917239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"6917239","articleId":"6756995","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6757001,"authors":[{"name":"WooSeok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6756988/6757001/6757001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["WooSeok Kim (S'13) received the M.S degree from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2001.

The dual-loop architecture where a fast subloop works as a DCO inside a main loop is chosen since it can efficiently suppress the ring oscillator phase noise. In order to satisfy a wide tuning range and fine resolution requirements in the pixel clock PLL, the TDC and DCO with two-step and bottom-up control are employed. An s-domain model is utilized to tune the loop parameters so that the dual-loop PLL has the optimum jitter performance. The measurement results match well with the proposed s-domain model and clearly show the effectiveness of the dual loop in suppressing the phase noise of the DCO. We propose a new cell-based layout technique to avoid performance degradation during automatic placement and routing, which is compatible with the conventional digital design environment.

This is due to many different aspects, such as the presence of mixed pixels in the data or the limited information available a priori. This has fostered the need to develop techniques able to exploit the rich spatial and spectral information present in the scenes while, at the same time, dealing with mixed pixels and limited training samples. In this paper, we present a new spectral-spatial classifier for hyperspectral data that specifically addresses the issue of mixed pixel characterization. In our presented approach, the spectral information is characterized both locally and globally, which represents an innovation with regard to previous approaches for probabilistic classification of hyperspectral data. Specifically, we use a subspace-based multinomial logistic regression method for learning the posterior probabilities and a pixel-based probabilistic support vector machine classifier as an indicator to locally determine the number of mixed components that participate in each pixel. The information provided by local and global probabilities is then fused and interpreted in order to characterize mixed pixels. Finally, spatial information is characterized by including a Markov random field (MRF) regularizer. Our experimental results, conducted using both synthetic and real hyperspectral images, indicate that the proposed classifier leads to state-of-the-art performance when compared with other approaches, particularly in scenarios in which very limited training samples are available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using Local and Global Probabilities for Mixed Pixel Characterization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2296031","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06757003.pdf","startPage":"6298","endPage":"6314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2296031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using Local and Global Probabilities for Mixed Pixel Characterization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6757003/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14331758","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program","grantNumber":"2011CB707103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using Local and Global Probabilities for Mixed Pixel Characterization","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2296031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135729S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6757003","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6757004,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo A.

This paper reviews all the major stability criteria for dc distribution systems that have been developed so far: the Middlebrook Criterion, the Gain Margin and Phase Margin Criterion, the Opposing Argument Criterion, the Energy Source Analysis Consortium (ESAC) Criterion, and the Three-Step Impedance Criterion. In particular, the paper discusses, for each criterion, the artificial conservativeness characteristics in the design of dc distribution systems, and the formulation of design specifications that ensure system stability. Moreover, the Passivity-Based Stability Criterion is discussed, which has been recently proposed as an alternative stability criterion. While all prior stability criteria are based on forbidden regions for the polar plot of the so-called minor loop gain, which is an impedance ratio, the proposed criterion is based on imposing passivity of the overall bus impedance. A meaningful simulation example is presented to illustrate the main characteristics of the reviewed stability criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2014.2309800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2014.2309800","startPage":"3525","endPage":"3535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6899725/06757016.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6899725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Review of Stability Criteria for DC Power Distribution Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Review of Stability Criteria for DC Power Distribution Systems","volume":"50","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2014","accessionNumber":"14597772","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757016/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-08-1-0080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Review of Stability Criteria for DC Power Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tia-riccobono-2309800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109231S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6899725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"6899725","articleId":"6757016","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6757019,"authors":[{"name":"Henry Arguello","affiliation":["Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Arguello","id":"37712475500"},{"name":"Gonzalo R.

This paper extends the compressive capabilities of CASSI by replacing the traditional blocking-unblocking coded apertures by a set of colored coded apertures. The colored coded apertures are optimized such that the number of projections is minimized while the quality of reconstruction is maximized. The optimal design of the colored coded apertures aims to better satisfy the restricted isometry property in CASSI. The optimal designs are compared with random colored coded aperture patterns and with the traditional blocking-unblocking coded apertures.

To achieve real-time multi-channel processing it is important to integrate spike sorting on-chip to overcome limitations in transmission bandwidth. This requires computationally efficient algorithms for feature extraction and clustering suitable for low-power hardware implementation. This paper describes a new feature extraction method for real-time spike sorting based on extrema analysis (namely positive peaks and negative peaks) of spike shapes and their discrete derivatives at different frequency bands. Employing simulation across different datasets, the accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed method are assessed and compared with other methods. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method in conjunction with online sorting (O-Sort) is 91.6%, outperforming all the other methods tested with the O-Sort clustering algorithm. The proposed method offers a better tradeoff between classification error and computational complexity, making it a particularly strong choice for on-chip spike sorting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757022/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429403","pubMedId":"24760942","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction Using Extrema Sampling of Discrete Derivatives for Spike Sorting in Implantable Upper-Limb Neural Prostheses","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Feature Extraction Using Extrema Sampling of Discrete Derivatives for Spike Sorting in Implantable Upper-Limb Neural Prostheses","sourcePdf":"tnsre-demosthenous-2309678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077968S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6848867","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6848867","articleId":"6757022","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6757026,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Du","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6757026/du-2303895-small.gif","p":["\nBo Du (M'11) received the B.S. degree from Wuhan University, Wuhan,\nChina, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from the State Key Laboratory of Information\nEngineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, in 2010.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer, Wuhan University.

Conventional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detection methods depend on the background statistics to construct the anomaly detection metric. One of the main problems with these methods is that the Gaussian distribution assumption of the background may not be reasonable. Furthermore, these methods are also susceptible to contamination of the conventional background covariance matrix by anomaly pixels. This paper proposes a new anomaly detection method by effectively exploiting a robust anomaly degree metric for increasing the separability between anomaly pixels and other background pixels, using discriminative information. First, the manifold feature is used so as to divide the pixels into the potential anomaly part and the potential background part. This procedure is called discriminative information learning. A metric learning method is then performed to obtain the robust anomaly degree measurements. Experiments with three hyperspectral data sets reveal that the proposed method outperforms other current anomaly detection methods.

Its operation is based on extending an existing parallel BCH decoder that can only correct single-bit errors and serially corrects double-adjacent errors at low speed. The proposed decoder is constructed by a novel design and is suitable for nanoscale memory systems, in which multiple-bit errors occur at a probability comparable to single-bit errors and double-adjacent errors occur at a higher probability (nearly two orders of magnitude) than other multiple-bit errors. Extensive simulation results are reported. Compared with the existing scheme, the area and delay time of the proposed decoder are on average 11% and 6% higher, but its power consumption is reduced by 9% on average. This paper also shows that the area, delay, and power overheads incurred by the proposed scheme are significantly lower than traditional fully parallelized BCH decoders capable of correcting any double-bit errors in parallel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757028/","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6757028/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14362434","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Bit and Double-Adjacent Error Correcting Parallel Decoder for Multiple-Bit Error Correcting BCH Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Bit and Double-Adjacent Error Correcting Parallel Decoder for Multiple-Bit Error Correcting BCH Codes","sourcePdf":"tdmr-lombardi-2309935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090019S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6824879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6824879","articleId":"6757028","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757033,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian I.

Since perfect channel state information (CSI) is hardly obtained, the robust design that takes into account the CSI imperfection plays a crucial role in the development of efficient resource-allocation schemes. As to the chunk-based resource-allocation scheme, this paper focuses on the imperfect CSI-based resource-allocation problem to jointly optimize the chunk assignment, transmission link selection (direct or relay link), and power allocation in multirelay OFDMA systems. The optimization formulation minimizes the total transmit power with transmission requirement constraints and is considered a mixed-integer optimization problem, and a dual-maximization-based joint resource-allocation algorithm is proposed. The proposed dual-maximization-based algorithm is shown to be optimal. We also develop a low-complexity but near-optimal resource-allocation algorithm. The numerical results validate the performance gains offered by the proposed joint resource-allocation algorithms. The results also show that the impact of imperfect CSI is nonnegligible, which highlights the importance of robust designs in practical wireless networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imperfect CSI-Based Joint Resource Allocation in Multirelay OFDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2309992","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06757034.pdf","startPage":"3806","endPage":"3817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2309992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Imperfect CSI-Based Joint Resource Allocation in Multirelay OFDMA Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6757034/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61102068, 61172077, 61372106 and 61 223001"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20113218120017"},{"fundingName":"National 863 High Technology Development Project","grantNumber":"2013AA013601"},{"fundingName":"Key Special Project of National Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003006"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2012D04 and 2014B01"},{"fundingName":"Program Sponsored for Scientific Innovation Research of College Graduate in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"CXZZ13_0098"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imperfect CSI-Based Joint Resource Allocation in Multirelay OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2309992-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105331S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6757034","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6757035,"authors":[{"name":"Weijian Liu","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240032500"},{"name":"Wenchong Xie","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenchong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288309100"},{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Xidian University, National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598328500"},{"name":"Yongliang Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yongliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293643900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6757035","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":788},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this two-part paper, we consider the problem of adaptive multidimensional/multichannel signal detection in Gaussian noise with unknown covariance matrix. The test data (primary data) is assumed as a collection of sample vectors, arranged as the columns of a rectangular data array. The rows and columns of the signal matrix are both assumed to lie in known subspaces, but with unknown coordinates. Due to this feature of the signal structure, we name this kind of signal as the double subspace signal. Part I of this paper focuses on the adaptive detection in homogeneous environments, while Part II deals with the adaptive detection in partially homogeneous environments. Precisely, in this part, we derive the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), Rao test, Wald test, as well as their two-step variations, in homogeneous environments. Three types of spectral norm tests (SNTs) are also introduced. All these detectors are shown to possess the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property. Moreover, we discuss the differences between them and show how they work. Another contribution is that we investigate various special cases of these detectors. Remarkably, some of them are well-known existing detectors, while some others are still new. At the stage of performance evaluation, conducted by Monte Carlo simulations, both matched and mismatched signals are dealt with. For each case, more than one scenario is considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06757035.pdf","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2309556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2309556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Double Subspace Signal Detection in Gaussian Background\u2014Part I: Homogeneous Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Covariance matrices","Vectors","Noise","Radar","Adaptation models","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","Monte Carlo methods","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive double subspace signal detection","Gaussian background","adaptive multidimensional/multichannel signal detection","Gaussian noise","covariance matrix","generalized likelihood ratio test","Rao test","Wald test","spectral norm tests","constant false alarm rate","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant false alarm rate (CFAR)","double subspace signal","generalized cosine-squared","homogeneous environments","multidimensional signal","signal mismatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Double Subspace Signal Detection in Gaussian Background\u2014Part I: Homogeneous Environments","volume":"62","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14219742","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Double Subspace Signal Detection in Gaussian Background\u2014Part I: Homogeneous Environments","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2309556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075039S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"105","articleId":"6757035","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6757036,"authors":[{"name":"Nesli Erdogmus","affiliation":["Biometrics Group, IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6776454/6757036/erdog-2309851-small.gif","p":["Nesli Erdogmus (M'11) graduated from the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2005.

Although the BoF model has many advantages, such as simplicity, generality, and scalability, it still suffers from several drawbacks, including the limited semantic description of local descriptors, lack of robust structures upon single visual words, and missing of efficient spatial weighting. To overcome these shortcomings, various techniques have been proposed, such as extracting multiple descriptors, spatial context modeling, and interest region detection. Though they have been proven to improve the BoF model to some extent, there still lacks a coherent scheme to integrate each individual module together. To address the problems above, we propose a novel framework with spatial pooling of complementary features. Our model expands the traditional BoF model on three aspects. First, we propose a new scheme for combining texture and edge-based local features together at the descriptor extraction level. Next, we build geometric visual phrases to model spatial context upon complementary features for midlevel image representation. Finally, based on a smoothed edgemap, a simple and effective spatial weighting scheme is performed to capture the image saliency. We test the proposed framework on several benchmark data sets for image classification. The extensive results show the superior performance of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Pooling of Heterogeneous Features for Image Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2310117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6779706/06757045.pdf","startPage":"1994","endPage":"2008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2310117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Pooling of Heterogeneous Features for Image Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6757045/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14209098","pubMedId":"24710400","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Pooling of Heterogeneous Features for Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tip-xie-2310117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108047S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6779706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6779706","articleId":"6757045","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6757058,"authors":[{"name":"B L Rajalakshmi Samaga","affiliation":["Canara Engineering College, Mangalore, Karnataka, IN"],"firstName":"B L Rajalakshmi","lastName":"Samaga"},{"name":"K.

Electrical, magnetic, mechanical, thermal and environmental stresses during operating conditions lead to internal faults in it. There are no reliable non-invasive tools available for early diagnoses of internal faults. Hence, these internal faults are likely to be left undetected in its early stage, leading to unscheduled maintenance, process shutdown and huge financial loss in industries. Early detection of faults helps to save resources by avoiding process shutdown/repair of machines. Hence, there is a need for a reliable non-invasive condition monitoring system for three phase squirrel cage induction motors. Condition monitoring involves non-invasive acquisition of signals, processing, fault signature extraction, decision making on the presence and type of faults. This paper reviews the current trends in internal fault diagnosis of induction machines and identifies future research options. A statistical analysis of the results of motor current signatures obtained from a motor with rotor bar faults is done to study the relative effect of fault severity and load variation on the current signature.","doi":"10.1109/ICAECT.2014.6757060","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Energy Conversion Technologies (ICAECT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Energy Conversion Technologies (ICAECT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746480/6757050/06757060.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAECT.2014.6757060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnoses of internal faults of three phase squirrel cage induction motor \u2014 A review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757060/","displayDocTitle":"Diagnoses of internal faults of three phase squirrel cage induction motor \u2014 A review","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14146823","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757060/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnoses of internal faults of three phase squirrel cage induction motor \u2014 A review","confLoc":"Manipal, India","sourcePdf":"RP009114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120196S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6746480","isNumber":"6757050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746480","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6757050","articleId":"6757060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757189,"authors":[{"name":"Keyu Chen","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6757189/6757189-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keyu Chen received his Ph.D. degrees in Communication Engineering from Xiamen University, China, in 2013.

In UWSNs, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has attracted strong attention due to its potentially large impact to the overall network performance. Unlike terrestrial networks, which mainly rely on radio waves for communications, UWSNs utilize acoustic waves, which pose a new research challenge in the design of MAC protocols. To present the development of MAC protocols in UWSNs, this paper surveys the current state-of-the-art MAC protocols for UWSNs. In the early development, the performance in terms of delay and throughput of the UWSNs has been the major concern of the MAC layer protocol design. Later, the design of energy-efficient MAC protocols becomes a new research focus because sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries which are less likely to be recharged. In this paper, we first describe the underwater acoustic environment and the challenges to the MAC protocols design in UWSNs. We then provide a comparative study of several types of MAC protocols according to current existing diverse implementations. Furthermore, open research issues will be summarized. Hopefully, this survey will inspire more active research in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14527941","htmlLink":"/document/6757189/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on MAC Protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on MAC Protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"13Ma32.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169316S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6757189","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6757190,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Amine Kafi","affiliation":["DTISI, CERIST Research Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6757190/6757190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Amine KAFI obtained the Engineer Degree from the College of Computer Science, Oued Smar, Algiers, Algeria in 2005 and the Master Degree in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology USTHB, Algiers, Algeria, in 2009.

All these limitations provide significant and unique design challenges to data transport control in wireless sensor networks. An effective transport protocol should consider reliable message delivery, energy-efficiency, quality of service and congestion control. The latter is vital for achieving a high throughput and a long network lifetime. Despite the huge number of protocols proposed in the literature, congestion control in WSN remains challenging. A review and taxonomy of the state-of-the-art protocols from the literature up to 2013 is provided in this paper. First, depending on the control policy, the protocols are divided into resource control vs. traffic control. Traffic control protocols are either reactive or preventive (avoiding). Reactive solutions are classified following the reaction scale, while preventive solutions are split up into buffer limitation vs. interference control. Resource control protocols are classified according to the type of resource to be tuned.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757190/","accessionNumber":"14527952","displayDocTitle":"Congestion Control Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion Control Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"10Kafi123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177822S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6757190","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6757191,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Nanjing University, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6757191/6757191-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Xie received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Nanjing University, China in 2004 and 2010, respectively, all in computer science.

As a remedy to the limited capability of a single node or network, cooperative communication technique has a potential to further improve the performance of cognitive networks, especially for spectrum sensing based cognitive networks. Given that spectrum efficiency of a cognitive network is determined jointly by spectrum sensing and access capabilities, it makes sense to employ cooperative techniques to enhance their performance. This article offers a tutorial on various cooperative techniques in cognitive networks, with its emphasis on spectrum sensing and access based cooperation, interference constraint based adaptive cooperative feedback, rateless network coding based cooperative transmission, and limited cooperation based interference coordination. Finally, numerical results are given to showcase advantages of the proposed cooperative schemes for cognitive networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks \u2014 From Theory to Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2014.021414.00066","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6880447/06757192.pdf","startPage":"1180","endPage":"1192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2014.021414.00066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks \u2014 From Theory to Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6757192/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","accessionNumber":"14527962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks \u2014 From Theory to Applications","sourcePdf":"02Chen066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159173S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6757192","onlineDate":"05 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6757210,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2214-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2213-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6757210","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1533},"abstract":"This paper presents a high gain 60 GHz LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) using a 9 Metal Generic 90-nm TSMC CMOS technology for the 60 GHz mm-Wave (millimetre wave) WPAN.

Mobility prediction is a technique to identify future targeted base station in advance, to reduce handover latency, and finally to enhance handover performance in wireless networks. In this paper, mobility prediction via Markov Chains with an input of user's mobility history is proposed as a technique to predict the user's movement in femtocells deployment. The results show that our proposed method predicts better when random data is 50% and above compared to the existing method. We had also analysed the effect of unavailable base station to the accuracy of the prediction in our proposed method.

In this paper ultrawideband multiple input multiple output (UWB-MIMO) radio channel characterization for body centric wireless communication is being presented. Body shadowing and body obstruction limits the channel capacity. It has been observed that MIMO antenna technique provide significant increase in capacity for body-centric wireless networks (BCWN). Spatial correlation matrices (complex and power correlation) have been computed and it has been noticed that the correlation values are much higher, where antennas are located in line-of-sight scenario as compared to none-line of sight case. In addition to this, capacity comparison of MIMO antenna with single input single output (SISO) and single input multiple output (SIMO) antenna system shows significant improvement for MIMO case, which supports the applicability of MIMO in BCWN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747035/6757193/06757257.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","doi":"10.1109/RFM.2013.6757257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2013.6757257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple input multiple output radio channel characterisation for ultra wideband body centric wireless communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Antenna measurements","Wireless communication","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","body sensor networks","channel capacity","radiowave propagation","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial correlation matrices","MIMO antenna technique","channel capacity","body obstruction","body shadowing","UWB MIMO radio channel","ultra wideband body centric wireless communication","multiple input multiple output radio channel characterisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra wideband","wireless body area networks","radio propagation modelling","Multiple input multiple output (MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiple input multiple output radio channel characterisation for ultra wideband body centric wireless communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757257/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147406","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple input multiple output radio channel characterisation for ultra wideband body centric wireless communication","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"238p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059637S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747035","isNumber":"6757193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747035","xplore-issue":"6757193","articleId":"6757257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757259,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Aoyagi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Decision Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Aoyagi","id":"37432820400"},{"name":"Kohei Suzaki","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Suzaki","id":"37086665760"},{"name":"Yoshinori Suzuki","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37275439600"},{"name":"Takashi Hirose","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Hirose","id":"38231026600"},{"name":"Takatoshi Sugiyama","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takatoshi","lastName":"Sugiyama","id":"37279145200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2214-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2213-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6757259","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"abstract":"In maritime mobile satellite communications, mechanically controlled tracking systems are used to compensate changes of antenna orientation due to changes of a ship attitude caused by waves or winds of the sea. Orientations of antennas on a ship are limited so that transmitted electromagnetic waves are not affected by structures on the ship. Thus it is allowed to transmit waves when a clearance angle is greater than certain criteria. Our group has researched about fundamental relation between clearance angles and interferences for other satellites or other systems on the ship by numerical simulations for a simplified model. In this report, a realistic ship model is assumed for the simulations. As a result, a clearance angle, which interferences to the receiving satellite are small, has been found out under the conditions of the simulations. A simple model which describes interferences to received levels of the aiming and neighboring satellites is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747035/6757193/06757259.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","doi":"10.1109/RFM.2013.6757259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2013.6757259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Marine vehicles","Satellite antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bridges","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave transmission","marine communication","mobile antennas","mobile radio","numerical analysis","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference model","maritime mobile satellite communications","tracking systems","antenna orientation","ship attitude","ship antenna","electromagnetic wave transmission","ship structures","numerical simulations","satellite receiving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite communications","maritime","interference","reception level","diffracted wave"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147425","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"247p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059348S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747035","isNumber":"6757193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747035","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6757193","articleId":"6757259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757267,"authors":[{"name":"Oualid Hammi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Oualid","lastName":"Hammi","id":"37294250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2214-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2213-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6757267","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Predictive models","Linearity","Radio frequency","Data models","Power measurement","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity behavioral model","RF power amplifiers","output waveform","device under test","power scaling block","Doherty power amplifier prototype","LTE signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral modeling","distortions","efficiency","power amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757267","doi":"10.1109/RFM.2013.6757267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2013.6757267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757193","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747035/6757193/06757267.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity behavioral model for RF power amplifiers' linearity and efficiency prediction","abstract":"This paper presents a novel power amplifiers' behavioral model that predicts both the linearity as well as the efficiency performances.

For wideband signals such as LTE-Advanced, time domain characterization of power amplifiers requires specialized and costly measurement equipments. This paper proposes an approach for characterizing the distortions of power amplifiers based on frequency domain metrics. Accordingly, power amplifiers' static as well as dynamic distortions are quantified using the adjacent channel leakage ratio and the spectrum asymmetry index, respectively. Both metrics are defined in the frequency domain and can be extracted from the measured spectrum at the amplifier's output. The proposed metrics were applied for the characterization of two Doherty power amplifiers prototypes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in comparing the strength of static distortions and memory effects of power amplifiers prototypes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Bandwidth","Frequency-domain analysis","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency power amplifiers","time-domain analysis","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic distortion","frequency domain metrics","wideband signals","LTE-Advanced","time domain characterization","measurement equipments","adjacent channel leakage ratio","spectrum asymmetry index","Doherty power amplifiers prototypes","static distortions","memory effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distortions","frequency domain","memory effects","power amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RFM.2013.6757268","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747035/6757193/06757268.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2013.6757268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantification of power amplifiers' static and dynamic distortions using frequency domain metrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantification of power amplifiers' static and dynamic distortions using frequency domain metrics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757268/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757268/","accessionNumber":"14147383","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantification of power amplifiers' static and dynamic distortions using frequency domain metrics","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"287p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027597S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747035","isNumber":"6757193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747035","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6757193","articleId":"6757268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6757269,"authors":[{"name":"Abderazak M.

In the proposed bandwidth-scalable two-box models, rather than updating the entire model coefficients when the signal bandwidth changes, the memoryless function is maintained unchanged and only the function modeling the dynamic distortions is updated. Experimental validation carried out on a Doherty amplifier prototype shows that the proposed bandwidth-scalable models are able to achieve the same performance as the conventional models while reducing the number of parameters to be updated following a change in the operating signal bandwidth by up to approximately 75% for the Hammerstein model and 40% for the forward twin-nonlinear two-box model.

low power consumption, small area and robustness. In order to meet new standards, such a OIF CEI-25G-LR, CEI-28G-MR/SR/VSR, IEEE802.3bj and 32G-FC, data-rates are increased to 25 to 28Gb/s, which is more than 75% higher than the previous generation of SerDes. For SerDes applications with several hundreds of lanes integrated in single chip, power consumption is very important factor while maintaining high performance. There are several previous works at 28Gb/s or higher data-rate [1-2]. They use an unrolled DFE to meet the critical timing margin, but the unrolled DFE structure increases the number of DFE slicers, increasing the overall power and die area. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce several circuits and architectural techniques. The analog front-end (AFE) uses a single-stage architecture and a compact on-chip passive inductor in the transimpedance amplifier (TIA), providing 15dB boost. The boost is adaptive and its adaptation loop is decoupled from the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) adaptation loop by the use of a group-delay adaptation (GDA) algorithm. DFE has a half-rate 1-tap unrolled structure with 2 total error latches for power and area reduction. A two-stage sense-amplifier-based slicer achieves a sensitivity of 15mV and DFE timing closure. We also develop a high-speed clock buffer that uses a new active-inductor circuit. This active-inductor circuit has the capability to control output-common-mode voltage to optimize circuit operating points.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757327","startPage":"38","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757327.pdf","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757327/","displayDocTitle":"2.1 28Gb/s 560mW multi-standard SerDes with single-stage analog front-end and 14-tap decision-feedback equalizer in 28nm CMOS","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757327/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14147540","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2.1 28Gb/s 560mW multi-standard SerDes with single-stage analog front-end and 14-tap decision-feedback equalizer in 28nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063145S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757328,"authors":[{"name":"Ullas Singh","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Ullas","lastName":"Singh","id":"37333503000"},{"name":"Adesh Garg","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Adesh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37302304200"},{"name":"Bharath Raghavan","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Bharath","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37974893400"},{"name":"Nick Huang","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Huang","id":"38237018000"},{"name":"Heng Zhang","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086677565"},{"name":"Zhi Huang","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Huang","id":"38237604300"},{"name":"Afshin Momtaz","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Momtaz","id":"37300222200"},{"name":"Jun Cao","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Cao","id":"37290967600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757328","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1730},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits","Inductors","Optical transmitters","Phase locked loops","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","IEEE standards","inductors","low-power electronics","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gearbox PHY","CMOS","network traffic speeds","power dissipation","gearbox transceiver","optical module power","low-power quad-lane transceiver","IEEE 802.3ba standard","low-jitter TX","half-rate calibrated RX slicer","folded active inductor","wide-range PLL","low-power half-rate clock driver","programmable distributed inductors","line-side interface","power 780 mW","size 40 nm"]}],"abstract":"Network traffic speeds are increasing to meet the demands of data centers and network operators to support data-rich services like video streaming and social media. This has accelerated the adoption of 100Gb/s connectivity from the present 10Gb/s and 40Gb/s rates. One challenge that remains is the high power consumption of 100Gb/s systems. As mentioned in [1], power dissipation of the 100GbE gearbox transceiver is a significant portion of the optical module power. This paper demonstrates a low-power quad-lane 20-to-28Gb/s transceiver targeting 100GbE/40GbE (IEEE 802.3ba) standard. The transceiver features a low-jitter TX, half-rate calibrated RX slicer with folded active inductor and a wide-range PLL (20 to 28GHz) with low-power half-rate clock driver using programmable distributed inductors. It operates from a standard 0.9V supply and the power consumption for line-side transceiver is 780mW for 28Gb/s. Additionally the chipset integrates a system interface that is CAUI-compliant, composed of a 10-lane data bus operating at 9.95 to 11.2Gb/s. In default mode it converts 100GbE (10\u00d710 Gb/s) signal to a 4\u00d725Gb/s line signal and vice versa. The line-side interface can also be reconfigured as 40GbE, with both line- and system-side operating at 4\u00d711.2Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757328","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757328.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2.2 A 780mW 4\u00d728Gb/s transceiver for 100GbE gearbox PHY in 40nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"2.2 A 780mW 4\u00d728Gb/s transceiver for 100GbE gearbox PHY in 40nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757328/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147471","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757328/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2.2 A 780mW 4\u00d728Gb/s transceiver for 100GbE gearbox PHY in 40nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04716S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757329,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Chuan Chiang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Chuan","lastName":"Chiang","id":"38580466900"},{"name":"Hao-Wei Hung","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Wei","lastName":"Hung","id":"38061753100"},{"name":"Hsiang-Yun Chu","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Yun","lastName":"Chu","id":"37086647712"},{"name":"Guan-Sing Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guan-Sing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085574626"},{"name":"Jri Lee","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jri","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280336000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757329","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2836},"abstract":"Recent research indicates that data-link transceivers running at or below 40Gb/s are practical to implement in CMOS technology [1].

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source). This method requires no injection of additional test signals and operates at a low rate, achieving low-noise and low-power operation, and also is suitable even for bangbang PLLs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2.9 A Background calibration technique to control bandwidth in digital PLLs","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757335","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757335.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"2.9 A Background calibration technique to control bandwidth in digital PLLs","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757335/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147568","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2.9 A Background calibration technique to control bandwidth in digital PLLs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035214S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757336,"authors":[{"name":"Shouhei Kousai","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shouhei","lastName":"Kousai","id":"37282491800"},{"name":"Kohei Onizuka","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Onizuka","id":"37293735900"},{"name":"Takashi Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"38237772400"},{"name":"Yasuhiko Kuriyama","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiko","lastName":"Kuriyama","id":"37607259100"},{"name":"Masami Nagaoka","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masami","lastName":"Nagaoka","id":"37344392700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757336","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":844},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Antennas","Tuners","Detectors","Power amplifiers","Impedance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","impedance matching","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar antenna impedance detection","3G-4G CMOS power amplifier design","efficiency loss","antenna impedance mismatch","power back-off","antenna size","user proximity effect","polar antenna impedance tuning"]}],"abstract":"One of the ultimate goals in power amplifier design is to enhance the effective efficiency and achieve a long battery life.

high-power-efficiency CMOS power amplifier (PA). To improve the power efficiency of the conventional linear PA [1-4], an envelope tracking (ET) technique, which modulates supply voltage of a linear PA, has attracted attention. However, the published power efficiency, gain and output power are not sufficient for LTE applications [5], and its typical implementation requires an external supply modulator that is a high-speed power supply circuit [6]. Envelope elimination and restoration (EER) is an alternative supply modulation technique that can further improve the power efficiency over ET by replacing the linear PA with a switching PA driven by a phase signal [7]. However, to meet the specified low distortion, especially for LTE with a wide bandwidth baseband signal, an EER PA generally has difficulty achieving a wide bandwidth for the phase signal path, and requires a high-speed supply modulator, and highly accurate timing between envelope and phase signals. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces an envelope / phase generator based on a mixer and a timing aligner based on a delay-locked loop. Additionally, they were integrated with a switching PA and a supply modulator on the same die.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3.2 A 1.95GHz fully integrated envelope elimination and restoration CMOS power amplifier with envelope/phase generator and timing aligner for WCDMA and LTE","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757337","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757337.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"3.2 A 1.95GHz fully integrated envelope elimination and restoration CMOS power amplifier with envelope/phase generator and timing aligner for WCDMA and LTE","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757337/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147463","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3.2 A 1.95GHz fully integrated envelope elimination and restoration CMOS power amplifier with envelope/phase generator and timing aligner for WCDMA and LTE","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049002S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757339,"authors":[{"name":"Ercan Kaymaksut","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Kaymaksut","id":"37594648300"},{"name":"Patrick Reynaert","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Reynaert","id":"37427206700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757339","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2003},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","Power generation","Circuit faults","Solid state circuits","Radio frequency","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","electric breakdown","Long Term Evolution","low-power electronics","modulation","MOSFET","radiofrequency integrated circuits","radiofrequency power amplifiers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage Doherty CMOS LTE RF power amplifier","high-data-rate communication system","SCT","series-combining dual-mode transformer","transistor","breakdown voltage","watt-level output power","PA","PAPR","peak-to-average power ratio","modulation scheme","size 40 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757339","abstract":"Modern high-data-rate communication systems such as LTE use spectrally efficient modulation schemes with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), placing stringent linearity demands on the RF power amplifiers (PA).

Unfortunately, the high IF requires high-quality-factor (Q) band-pass filters for image rejection, which cannot be easily integrated in CMOS. This forced the CMOS receivers to migrate to zero (or low) IF and suffer from the abovementioned problems. Recently, there have been attempts to revisit the high IF operation by exploiting N-path filtering [1] and a combination of a discrete-time (DT) band-pass charge-sharing filtering with feedback filtering [2]. Here, we propose a superheterodyne RX architecture with full DT operation using only g\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n stages, switches and capacitors. The transfer function is accurate and controlled by the clock frequency and precise capacitor ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3.8 A fully integrated highly reconfigurable discrete-time superheterodyne receiver","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757343","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757343.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"3.8 A fully integrated highly reconfigurable discrete-time superheterodyne receiver","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757343/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147652","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3.8 A fully integrated highly reconfigurable discrete-time superheterodyne receiver","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036603S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757347,"authors":[{"name":"Danzhu Lu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Danzhu","lastName":"Lu","id":"38237164100"},{"name":"Yao Qian","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085434947"},{"name":"Zhiliang Hong","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276342300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757347","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inductors","Voltage control","Phase locked loops","Switching frequency","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","DC-DC power convertors","inductors","power control","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic voltage scaling","DVS technique","single output converters","system power efficiency","fast reference tracking","load regulation problem","inductor current","accumulative error","comparator based controlled SIMO converters","switching loss","switching cycle","energy recovery","charge control technique","freewheel switch","associated power dissipation","power density","freewheel period","PCCM control","pseudocontinuous conduction mode","power consumption","cross regulation","production cost","single inductor multiple output","load capability","portable devices","battery longevity","ripple based adaptive off time control","four output DC-DC buck converter","DVS capable single inductor converter"]}],"abstract":"Improving battery longevity in portable devices usually requires the use of different voltage levels with a wide range of load capability for various functional blocks. Since a single-inductor-multiple-output (SIMO) converter can support multiple output voltages while using only one inductor, it is an excellent candidate to minimize the component count and thus the production cost. However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5]. Although pseudo-continuous conduction-mode (PCCM) control with a freewheel period [1] tries to augment power density and eliminate cross-regulation, associated power dissipation of freewheel switch exacerbates its overall efficiency. The charge-control technique with energy recovery presented [2] decouples the output channels between each switching cycle, at the expense of additional switching loss and slow response. The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel. In addition, cross-regulation and slow response also limit the application of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique, which is widely used in single-output converters to improve the system power efficiency by providing variable voltage with fast reference tracking.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757347","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757347.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4.3 An 87%-peak-efficiency DVS-capable single-inductor 4-output DC-DC buck converter with ripple-based adaptive off-time control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757347/","displayDocTitle":"4.3 An 87%-peak-efficiency DVS-capable single-inductor 4-output DC-DC buck converter with ripple-based adaptive off-time control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147520","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757347/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4.3 An 87%-peak-efficiency DVS-capable single-inductor 4-output DC-DC buck converter with ripple-based adaptive off-time control","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033913S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757350,"authors":[{"name":"Loai G.

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) can help achieve these goals in load circuits, though generally at the expense of increased DC-DC converter size (through use of external inductors) or loss (through linear regulation). While switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters can offer conversion in small fully integrated form factors [1-5], their efficiencies are only high at discrete ratios between the input and output voltages. To increase an SC converter efficiency across its output voltage range, multiple conversion ratios can be utilized to realize a finer output voltage resolution. For instance, many converters employ a small handful of conversion ratios [1-4]. However, more conversion ratios are generally necessary to achieve high efficiency across the wide output range necessary for DVS, as converter efficiencies can otherwise fall by more than 20% between unloaded ratios [1-4]. Unfortunately, increasing the number of ratios beyond a small handful using standard topologies can significantly increase the number of components, escalating converter complexity and adding losses in the additional switching elements. To overcome this, a successive approximation (SAR) SC topology was proposed in [6] which cascades several 2:1 SC stages to provide a large number of conversion ratios with minimal hardware overhead. However, the linear cascading of stages introduces cascaded losses, limiting overall efficiency. For example, the minimum R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">out</sub>\n is more than 30X R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">out</sub>\n of a similar ratio Series-Parallel topology using the same silicon area. Additionally, current density is limited to that of a single stage, and capacitance utilization can be low for many conversion ratios.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757350","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE

This paper presents an iVRM system developed for the POWER8\u2122 microprocessor, which functions as a very fast, accurate low-dropout regulator (LDO), with 90.5% peak power efficiency (only 3.1% worse than an ideal LDO). At low output voltages, efficiency is reduced but still sufficient to realize beneficial energy savings with DVFS. Each iVRM features a bypass mode so that some of the cores can be operated at maximum performance with no regulator loss. With the iVRM area including the input decoupling capacitance (DCAP) (but not the output DCAP inherent to the cores), the iVRMs achieve a power density of 34.5W/mm\n<sup

These supply fluctuations are caused by sudden changes in the current consumed by the microprocessor in response to variations in workloads. This non-ideal supply can cause performance degradation or functional failures. Therefore, a significant amount of margin (10-15%) needs to be added to the ideal voltage (if there were no AC voltage variations) to ensure that the processor always executes correctly at the committed voltage-frequency points. This excess voltage wastes power proportional to the square of the voltage increase.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5.6 Adaptive clocking system for improved power efficiency in a 28nm x86-64 microprocessor","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757358","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757358.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"5.6 Adaptive clocking system for improved power efficiency in a 28nm x86-64 microprocessor","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757358/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147496","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5.6 Adaptive clocking system for improved power efficiency in a 28nm x86-64 microprocessor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070391S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757359,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Tokunaga","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Tokunaga","id":"37392829000"},{"name":"Joseph F.

The primary goals for the Haswell program are platform integration and low power to enable smaller form factors. Haswell incorporates several building blocks, including: platform controller hubs (PCHs), memory, CPU, graphics and media processing engines, thus creating a portfolio of product segments from fan-less Ultrabooks\u2122 to high-performance desktop, as shown in Fig. 5.9.1.

Figure 6.2.1 shows the commercial system capacity evolution of NTT's network over the last 30 years. The transmission capacity of today's Optical Transport Network (OTN) exceeds 1Tbit/s based on the conventional single-core singlemode fiber (SMF) at the growth rate about 1.4-to-1.5 times a year. In 10 years however, we will encounter the fundamental capacity limit of conventional SMF at around 100 Tb/s due to optical fiber nonlinearity and the limitation of allowable fiber launched power into the SMF. In this paper, the impact and future scaling of digital signal processing (DSP) on high-capacity OTN are investigated. A high-speed optical communication system with coherent detection aided by DSP ASIC, that is a digital coherent system, has great potential to change the transmission system design. This approach can enhance total commercial system capacity to more than 8 Tbit/s. Digital coherent systems will evolve to both high-speed applications and ultralow power consumption applications in the near future. Further future enhancements to the key DSP are discussed enabling 1Pb/s/fiber capacity in combination with space division multiplexing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State

Data conversion is typically accomplished using discrete devices that are interfaced to the FPGA using various IO standards. However, exponential growth in bandwidth as a result of increasing channel count and higher sample rate means this IO interface is becoming a limiting factor in the system budget with respect to interconnect complexity and associated power. The integration of flexible data converters with FPGA eliminates this IO cost and also offers a dynamically scalable, power efficient platform solution that addresses diverse application needs. In this paper, we demonstrate an aggregate bandwidth in excess of 400Gb/s using sixteen 16b DAC instances running at 1.6GS/s with an FPGA-to-die interface power of 0.3mW/Gb/s. We introduce a reconfigurable receive system that allows channel count to trade with system sample rate. Specifically, we demonstrate a 500MS/s ADC by interleaving four 125MS/s units.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"6.3 A Heterogeneous 3D-IC consisting of two 28nm FPGA die and 32 reconfigurable high-performance data converters","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757364","startPage":"120","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757364.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"6.3 A Heterogeneous 3D-IC consisting of two 28nm FPGA die and 32 reconfigurable high-performance data converters","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757364/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147462","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"6.3 A Heterogeneous 3D-IC consisting of two 28nm FPGA die and 32 reconfigurable high-performance data converters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0725S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757365,"authors":[{"name":"JungChak Ahn","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"JungChak","lastName":"Ahn","id":"38042315400"},{"name":"Kyungho Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37067049900"},{"name":"Yitae Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Yitae","lastName":"Kim","id":"38067453800"},{"name":"Heegeun Jeong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Heegeun","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37290388200"},{"name":"Bumsuk Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Bumsuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37067977300"},{"name":"Hongki Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Hongki","lastName":"Kim","id":"37088711456"},{"name":"Jongeun Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongeun","lastName":"Park","id":"37859424000"},{"name":"Taesub Jung","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Taesub","lastName":"Jung","id":"38063368700"},{"name":"Wonje Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Wonje","lastName":"Park","id":"37088711284"},{"name":"Taeheon Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Taeheon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277270000"},{"name":"Eunkyung Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Eunkyung","lastName":"Park","id":"37088712186"},{"name":"Sangjun Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangjun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37065984300"},{"name":"Gyehun Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Gyehun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37088710004"},{"name":"Haeyong Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Haeyong","lastName":"Park","id":"38105235700"},{"name":"Yujung Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Yujung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37088711293"},{"name":"Seungwook Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungwook","lastName":"Lee","id":"37087886109"},{"name":"Yunkyung Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Yunkyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37735932000"},{"name":"Y.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0\u03bcm size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12\u03bcm-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0\u03bcm and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0\u03bcm pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0\u03bcm.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757365","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"124","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"7.1 A 1/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12\u03bcm pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"7.1 A 1/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12\u03bcm pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757365/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147561","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757365/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"7.1 A 1/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12\u03bcm pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098946S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757366,"authors":[{"name":"Seokjun Park","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Seokjun","lastName":"Park","id":"38240901800"},{"name":"Jihyun Cho","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Jihyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"38238016500"},{"name":"Kyuseok Lee","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Kyuseok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085376736"},{"name":"Euisik Yoon","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Euisik","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37275464600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757366","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical device fabrication","Optical imaging","Optical signal processing","Optical reflection","Optical buffering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial organs","autonomous aerial vehicles","decoding","eye","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired time-stamp-based 2D optic flow sensor","miniaturized low-power artificial compound eyes","microair vehicle","insect visual organs","photoreceptors","hemispherical lens configuration","optical path","wide-field optic flow sensing","pseudohemispherical configuration","2D array optic flow sensors","MAV","elementary motion detector","EMD","neuromorphic algorithms","analog VLSI circuits","autonomous navigation","analog signal processing","low power design techniques","pixel-level circuits","pixel-level processing","column-parallel processing","chip-level processing","temporal filtering","feature detection","digital circuits","4-wired serial peripheral interface bus","SPI","decoding"]}],"abstract":"Miniaturized low-power artificial compound eyes in a small form factor and a low payload can be a promising approach to provide wide-field information for micro-air-vehicle (MAV) applications. Recently, research efforts have been made to realize bio-inspired artificial compound eyes to mimic the wide field of view (FoV) of insect visual organs by implementing photoreceptors to independently face different angles [1-2]. However, these approaches have drawbacks. They use complicated fabrication processes to form a hemispherical lens configuration and secure an independent optical path to each photoreceptor. We take a simple and practical approach to realize wide-field optic flow sensing in a pseudo-hemispherical configuration by mounting a number of 2D array optic flow sensors on a flexible PCB module as shown in Figure 7.2.1. In this scheme, the 2D optic flow sensor should meet the requirements of MAV applications: extremely low power consumption while maintaining robust optic flow generation. Conventional optic flow algorithms, such as Lucas-and-Kanade, require huge amounts of numerical calculations; therefore, they require substantial digital hardware (CPU and/or FPGA), resulting in large power consumption [3-4]. As an alternative approach for low-power implementation, bio-inspired elementary motion detector (EMD) based algorithms (or neuromorphic algorithms) have been studied and implemented in analog VLSI circuits for autonomous navigation [5-6]. However, pure analog signal processing is easily susceptible to temperature and process variations and it is difficult to scale the pixel size or apply low-power design techniques because extensive analog processing is implemented in pixel-level circuits. In this work, we have devised and implemented a time-stamp-based optic flow algorithm, which is modified from the conventional EMD algorithm to give an optimum partitioning of hardware blocks in analog and digital domains as well as assign adequate allocation of pixel-level, column-parallel, and chip-level processing. Temporal filtering, which may require huge hardware resources if implemented in the digital domain, remains in a pixel-level analog processing unit. Feature detection is implemented using digital circuits that are column parallel. The embedded digital core decodes the 2D time-stamp information into velocity using chip-level processing. Finally, the estimated 16b optic flow data are compressed and transmitted to the host through a 4-wired Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"7.2 243.3pJ/pixel bio-inspired time-stamp-based 2D optic flow sensor for artificial compound eyes","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757366","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757366.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"7.2 243.3pJ/pixel bio-inspired time-stamp-based 2D optic flow sensor for artificial compound eyes","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757366/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14156474","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"7.2 243.3pJ/pixel bio-inspired time-stamp-based 2D optic flow sensor for artificial compound eyes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066394S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757368,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Man Han","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Sang-Man","lastName":"Han","id":"37085482313"},{"name":"Taishi Takasawa","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Taishi","lastName":"Takasawa","id":"38072581400"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Akahori","affiliation":["Brookman Technology, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Akahori","id":"38071525400"},{"name":"Keita Yasutomi","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Yasutomi","id":"37680557800"},{"name":"Keiichiro Kagawa","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichiro","lastName":"Kagawa","id":"37278023200"},{"name":"Shoji Kawahito","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Kawahito","id":"37300195700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757368","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Modulation","Image resolution","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS image sensors","Electric fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-duration light pulses","high-modulation-frequency light pulses","charge-draining gate","lock-in pixels","background light cancelation","moving objects range measurements","background-canceled range image","cost-effective mass production","photodiode","CMOS image sensor technology","range imager developments","automobiles","security systems","robots","amusement","gesture-based remote controllers","3D mice","time-of-flight range imagers","lateral-electric-field charge modulators","in-pixel background canceling","time-of-flight CMOS image sensor"]}],"abstract":"Time-of-Flight (ToF) range imagers have a wide range of applications, such as 3D mice, gesture-based remote controllers, amusement, robots, security systems, and automobiles. Numerous ToF range imager developments have been reported [1-4]. Recent developments are often based on CMOS image sensor technology with pinned photodiode options [5-7], which are suitable for cost-effective mass production. Reported CMOS ToF range imagers use single-tap or two-tap lock-in pixels; to cancel the influence of background light, two or four sub-frames are used to produce a background-canceled range image. These architectures, however, have difficulty with precise range measurements of moving objects, because background light cancelation is not guaranteed for moving objects. Lock-in pixels without any charge-draining gate suffer from background light during the readout time of the operation. Another important issue with CMOS ToF range imagers for high range resolution is the speed of lock-in pixels, which must be improved to use high-modulation-frequency light or short-duration light pulses.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757368","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"130","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"7.4 A 413\u00d7240-pixel sub-centimeter resolution Time-of-Flight CMOS image sensor with in-pixel background canceling using lateral-electric-field charge modulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"7.4 A 413\u00d7240-pixel sub-centimeter resolution Time-of-Flight CMOS image sensor with in-pixel background canceling using lateral-electric-field charge modulators","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757368/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147578","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"7.4 A 413\u00d7240-pixel sub-centimeter resolution Time-of-Flight CMOS image sensor with in-pixel background canceling using lateral-electric-field charge modulators","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D0704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046515S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757370,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Payne","affiliation":["Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Payne","id":"37664304000"},{"name":"Andy Daniel","affiliation":["Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Daniel","id":"37085344573"},{"name":"Anik Mehta","affiliation":["Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Anik","lastName":"Mehta","id":"37088715642"},{"name":"Barry Thompson","affiliation":["Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37379797300"},{"name":"Cyrus S.

The power dissipation, supply voltage, and IC area are some of the most important criteria for successful WBAN implementations. Analog-intensive heterodyne receivers (RX) have been previously demonstrated, consuming 4 to 5mW of power from a 1-to-1.2V supply while occupying large silicon area, due to the presence of area-intensive analog building blocks such as low-pass filters at the IF [1,2]. Digital-intensive RX architectures can potentially result in sub-1V operation with significant reductions in power consumption and area, but require system and circuit-level innovations to achieve desired sensitivity and linearity. This paper presents a mostly-digital 2.4GHz RX architecture that uses a sub-sampling technique with digital IF/baseband signal processing to enable low-power (1.3mW) and low-voltage (0.6V) operation, resulting in ~3x reduction in power consumption. Early analog-to-digital conversion leads to the IC occupying only 0.35mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of active silicon area.

Wearable systems, such as head-mounted display (HMD) systems, have attempted to support real-time AR as a next generation UI/UX [1-2], but have failed, due to their limited computing power. In a prior work, a chip with limited AR functionality was reported that could perform AR with the help of markers placed in the environment (usually 1D or 2D bar codes) [3]. However, for a seamless visual experience, 3D objects should be rendered directly on the natural video image without any markers. Unlike marker-based AR, markerless AR requires natural feature extraction, general object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and camera-pose estimation to be performed in parallel. For instance, markerless AR for a VGA input-test video consumes ~1.3W power at 0.2fps throughput, with TI's OMAP4430, which exceeds power limits for wearable devices. Consequently, there is a need for a high-performance energy-efficient markerless AR processor to realize a real-time AR system, especially for HMD applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757391","startPage":"182","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers

for not only ultra-low power, but also high performance, even in standby-power-critical applications. Sensor nodes, for example, need a microcontroller unit (MCU) that has the ability to process signals and compress data immediately. A previously reported 130nm CMOS and FeRAM-based MCU features zero-standby power and fast wakeup operation by incorporating FeRAM devices into logic circuits [1]. The 8MHz speed, however, was not sufficiently high to meet application requirements, and the FeRAM process also has drawbacks: low compatibility with standard CMOS, and write endurance limitations. A spintronics-based nonvolatile integrated circuit is a promising option to achieve zero standby power and high-speed operation, along with compatibility with CMOS processes. In this work, we demonstrate a fully nonvolatile 16b MCU using 90nm standard CMOS and three-terminal SpinRAM technology. It achieves 20MHz, 145\u03bcW/MHz operation with a 1V supply in the active state, and 4.5\u03bcW intermittent operation with 120ns wakeup time and 0.1% active ratio, without forwarding of re-boot code from memory. The features provide sufficiently long battery life to achieve maintenance-free sensor nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757392","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE

communication systems face conflicting design constraints. On the one hand, the expanding variety of transmission modes calls for highly flexible solutions supporting the ever-growing number and diversity of application requirements. On the other hand, stringent power restrictions (e.g., at femto base stations and terminals) must be considered, while satisfying the demanding performance requirements. In order to cope with these issues, existing SDR platforms, e.g. [1-2], propose an MPSoC with a heterogeneous array of processing elements (PEs). MPSoC solutions provide programmability and parallelism yielding flexibility, processing performance and power efficiency. To schedule the resources and to apply power gating, a static approach is employed. In contrast, we present a heterogeneous MPSoC platform (Tomahawk2) with runtime scheduling and fine-grained hierarchical power management. This solution can fully adapt to the dynamically varying workload and semi-deterministic behavior in modern concurrent wireless applications. The proposed dynamic scheduler (CoreManager, CM) can be implemented either in software on a general-purpose processor or on a dedicated application-specific hardware unit. It is evident that the software approach offers the highest degree of flexibility; however, it may become a performance-bottleneck for complex applications. A high-throughput ASIC was presented in [3], but this solution does not permit scheduling algorithms to be adjusted. In this work, these limitations are overcome by implementing the CM on an ASIP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"10.7 A 105GOPS 36mm<sup>2</sup> heterogeneous SDR MPSoC with energy-aware dynamic scheduling and iterative detection-decoding for 4G in 65nm CMOS","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757394","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757394.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"10.7 A 105GOPS 36mm<sup>2</sup> heterogeneous SDR MPSoC with energy-aware dynamic scheduling and iterative detection-decoding for 4G in 65nm CMOS","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757394/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147595","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"10.7 A 105GOPS 36mm<sup>2</sup> heterogeneous SDR MPSoC with energy-aware dynamic scheduling and iterative detection-decoding for 4G in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05449S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757396,"authors":[{"name":"Pieter Harpe","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Harpe","id":"37299089900"},{"name":"Eugenio Cantatore","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Cantatore","id":"37323486600"},{"name":"Arthur van Roermund","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"van Roermund","id":"37275492800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757396","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":5394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Noise","Power demand","Linearity","Clocks","Capacitors","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","delta-sigma modulation","interference suppression","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled SAR ADC","linearity enhancements","SNDR","autonomous wireless sensor nodes","cloud networks","ultra-low-power electronics","sensor readout interfaces","low-speed high-precision ADCs","bio-potential signals","environmental information","interactive multimedia","\u0394\u03a3 ADCs","low-power SAR ADCs","feedback-controlled data-driven noise reduction","dithering techniques","chopping techniques","oversampling techniques","word length 12 bit","word length 14 bit"]}],"abstract":"Autonomous wireless sensor nodes for cloud networks require ultra-low-power electronics. In particular, sensor readout interfaces need low-speed high-precision ADCs for capturing, e.g., bio-potential signals, environmental information, or interactive multimedia. For these applications, state-of-the-art SAR ADCs can provide highly power-efficient solutions (<;10fJ/conversion-step) but with limited accuracy (SNDR <;63dB) [1,2]. Alternatively, \u0394\u03a3 ADCs offer higher precision at the cost of lower efficiency (e.g. 84dB SNDR with 54fJ/conversion-step [3]). This work bridges the existing performance gap by extending the accuracy of low-power SAR ADCs to SNDRs in the order of 70-to-80dB. Feedback-controlled data-driven noise reduction [1], oversampling, chopping [4] and dithering [5] techniques are combined to increase both SNR and linearity in a power-efficient way. Various ADC modes are supported by making these techniques individually programmable, thereby extending the application range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"11.1 An oversampled 12/14b SAR ADC with noise reduction and linearity enhancements achieving up to 79.1dB SNDR","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757396","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757396.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"11.1 An oversampled 12/14b SAR ADC with noise reduction and linearity enhancements achieving up to 79.1dB SNDR","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757396/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"11.1 An oversampled 12/14b SAR ADC with noise reduction and linearity enhancements achieving up to 79.1dB SNDR","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081807S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757397,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Yen Tai","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yen","lastName":"Tai","id":"38466451300"},{"name":"Yao-Sheng Hu","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Sheng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085550175"},{"name":"Hung-Wei Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37678113800"},{"name":"Hsin-Shu Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Shu","lastName":"Chen","id":"38248148000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757397","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":5910},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Capacitors","Energy resolution","Redundancy","Signal resolution","CMOS integrated circuits","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","digital-analogue conversion","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subranging SAR ADC","analog-to-digital converters","wireless sensor networks","healthcare electronic devices","long-term signal condition monitoring","battery life","energy-efficient ADC","successive-approximation register architecture","digital circuits","low supply voltages","power consumption","energy-efficient capacitive-DAC switching method","low-power comparator","majority voting technique","detect-and-skip algorithm","aligned switching technique","low-noise comparator","FoM performance","CMOS","word length 10 bit","size 40 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757397","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757397.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757397","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"11.2 A 0.85fJ/conversion-step 10b 200kS/s subranging SAR ADC in 40nm CMOS","abstract":"Analog-to-digital converters (ADC) are extensively used in wireless sensor networks and healthcare electronic devices to monitor long-term signal conditions.

Sensing whole TSP channels projected into a single-channel circuit prevents hardware redundancy due to a requirement for parallel circuits and enables designers to focus on maximizing noise-filtering performance with less concern about hardware cost.

To meet the overall performance-scaling needs, high-speed and high-bandwidth memory is becoming increasingly important. Conventional VLSI systems often rely on on-die SRAMs to address the performance gap between CPU and main memory, DRAM. However, with the rapid growth in capacity needs for high-performance memory, SRAM is not always sufficient to meet the demands of bandwidth-intense applications. Embedded DRAM (eDRAM) has been explored as an alternative to satisfy the high-performance and density needs in memory [1-3]. In this paper, a high-performance eDRAM based on a 22nm tri-gate CMOS technology is introduced. This eDRAM technology enables the integration of an eDRAM cell into the logic technology platform [4]. The design features a well-balanced configuration to achieve both optimal array efficiency and bandwidth. By leveraging the high-performance and low-voltage tri-gate transistor at 22nm generation, the eDRAM achieves a wide range in operating voltage, from 1.1V down to 0.7V, which is essential for low-power logic applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757412","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE

power and small size has been increasing for system-on-a-chip (SoC). The FinFET is considered as one of the most promising technologies for future low-power mobile applications because of its good scaling ability, high on-current, better SCE and subthreshold slope, and small leakage current [1]. As a key approach for low-power, supply-voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n) scaling has been widely used in SoC design. However, SRAM is the limiting factor of voltage-scaling, since all SRAM functions of read, write, and hold-stability are highly influenced by increased variations at low V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n, resulting in lower yield. In addition, the width-quantization property of FinFET device reduces the design window for transistor sizing, and increases the failure probability due to the un-optimized bitcell sizing [1]. In order to overcome the bitcell challenges to high yield, peripheral-assist techniques are required.

This trend necessitates assist circuits for SRAM to increase the immunity against variations, and many papers in this area [1-4] have been published. In this paper, we present an assist circuit suitable for the SRAMs in 20nm generation. Figure 13.3.1 compares local variations of SRAM cell transistors, pass-gate NMOS (PG), pull-down NMOS (PD) and pull-up PMOS (PU) for 28 and 20nm, showing degradation as the process advances. Noticeably, the NMOS transistors become worse than PMOS, which causes degradation in SRAM operating margin since SRAM characteristics such as static noise margin (SNM) are more sensitive to NMOS than PMOS. Figure 13.3.1 also shows the operational window enclosed by read and write immunity against local variations in 28 and 20nm. This indicates assist circuits must perform beyond the level established in previously published work to address SRAM variation in advanced technology nodes. Lowering wordline (WL) voltage level is one of the read-assist approaches. Lowering the supply voltage of PU in a cell (ARVDD) and negative bitline (BL) techniques are known to be effective for the write operation. These techniques, however, have side-effects: lowering the WL voltage degrades write margin and lowering ARVDD leads to higher power consumption and a long cycle-time. Furthermore, the negative BL technique can cause write errors in non-selected columns. Thus, it is necessary to select which assist technique should be applied depending on each process technology. In addition, the SRAM used in production generally include single-port SRAM (SP-SRAM) and dual-port SRAM (DP-SRAM), so the assist circuits to be applied should be effective for whole SRAM family.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757414","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757414.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"13.3 20nm High-density single-port and dual-port SRAMs with wordline-voltage-adjustment system for read/write assists","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"13.3 20nm High-density single-port and dual-port SRAMs with wordline-voltage-adjustment system for read/write assists","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757414/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147657","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"13.3 20nm High-density single-port and dual-port SRAMs with wordline-voltage-adjustment system for read/write assists","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031971S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757415,"authors":[{"name":"Toshikazu Fukuda","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshikazu","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37073192200"},{"name":"Koji Kohara","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Kohara","id":"37087724007"},{"name":"Toshiaki Dozaka","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Dozaka","id":"37073155400"},{"name":"Yasuhisa Takeyama","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhisa","lastName":"Takeyama","id":"37339736700"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Midorikawa","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Midorikawa","id":"37087723092"},{"name":"Kenji Hashimoto","affiliation":["Toshiba Microelectronics, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37086794999"},{"name":"Ichiro Wakiyama","affiliation":["Toshiba Microelectronics, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichiro","lastName":"Wakiyama","id":"37072636100"},{"name":"Shinji Miyano","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Miyano","id":"37360086300"},{"name":"Takehiko Hojo","affiliation":["Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiko","lastName":"Hojo","id":"37729715700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1432},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757415","abstract":"Battery lifetime is the key feature in the growing markets of sensor networks and energy-management system (EMS). Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1\u03bcA during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000\u00d7 compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible in the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds. This paper describes a 128kb SRAM with 3.5nA (27fA/b) retention current, 7ns access time, and 25\u03bcW/MHz active energy consumption. Its low retention current, high-speed, and low-power operation enable to activate SRAM in the deep-sleep mode, and also provides fast wake-up, low active energy consumption and high performance to MCU.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757415","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","startPage":"236","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"13.4 A 7ns-access-time 25\u03bcW/MHz 128kb SRAM for low-power fast wake-up MCU in 65nm CMOS with 27fA/b retention current","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Leakage currents","Transistors","Logic gates","Energy consumption","Nonvolatile memory","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","flash memories","leakage currents","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode transitions","XLL SRAM","control logic circuits","active current","low-leakage current SRAM","FRAM memory cells","nonvolatile memory","random-access memory","embedded Flash memories","deep sleep mode","standby state","computing phase","active sensing","energy consumption","active power","standby power","energy-management system","sensor networks","battery lifetime","retention current","CMOS","low-power fast wake-up MCU","access-time","time 7 ns","storage capacity 128 Kbit","size 65 nm","current 3.5 nA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"13.4 A 7ns-access-time 25\u03bcW/MHz 128kb SRAM for low-power fast wake-up MCU in 65nm CMOS with 27fA/b retention current","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147503","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757415/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757415/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"13.4 A 7ns-access-time 25\u03bcW/MHz 128kb SRAM for low-power fast wake-up MCU in 65nm CMOS with 27fA/b retention current","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040972S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757416,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Huei Chen","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Huei","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185516600"},{"name":"Wei-Min Chan","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Min","lastName":"Chan","id":"37893653700"},{"name":"Wei-Cheng Wu","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37351014600"},{"name":"Hung-Jen Liao","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Jen","lastName":"Liao","id":"37533875200"},{"name":"Kuo-Hua Pan","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Hua","lastName":"Pan","id":"37445452700"},{"name":"Jhon-Jhy Liaw","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhon-Jhy","lastName":"Liaw","id":"37326761300"},{"name":"Tang-Hsuan Chung","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tang-Hsuan","lastName":"Chung","id":"38184157800"},{"name":"Quincy Li","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Quincy","lastName":"Li","id":"37536145400"},{"name":"George H.

Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one.

The continuing increase of network-connected devices risks depletion of IPv4 addresses. As for IPv6, the number of routing-table entries is about to reach 16k with a rapid annual growth rate of 90%. This growth trend will continue in the Internet-of-Things era. In growing network applications with large amounts of traffic, there is a demand for routers and switches capable of packet processing for applications such as forwarding, quality of service, classification and access control. Fully parallel ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) are the key devices to handle the large number of routes in the lookup table with high-throughput low-latency header processing [1-6]. Realizing both high-density (high-capacity) and high-speed search operation is a challenge due to high power consumption and diminishing signal integrity for search operations. Process scaling is important to achieve a high-density high-performance TCAM, but it incurs the decrease of operating margin caused by threshold-voltage variation. This paper presents a 400MHz 4-paralleled search-operation 80Mb TCAM test-chip in a 28nm process that can accommodate 1M entries. This chip has three key features: flexible search mode, row and column shift redundancy, and search omission with valid-bit. With flexible search mode, the TCAM can be adapted to both IPv4 and IPv6.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757417","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757417.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"13.6 A 28nm 400MHz 4-parallel 1.6Gsearch/s 80Mb ternary CAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"13.6 A 28nm 400MHz 4-parallel 1.6Gsearch/s 80Mb ternary CAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147593","htmlLink":"/document/6757417/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"13.6 A 28nm 400MHz 4-parallel 1.6Gsearch/s 80Mb ternary CAM","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041838S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757418,"authors":[{"name":"Bharan Giridhar","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Bharan","lastName":"Giridhar","id":"37545651800"},{"name":"Nathaniel Pinckney","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Nathaniel","lastName":"Pinckney","id":"37402619000"},{"name":"Dennis Sylvester","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Sylvester","id":"37274874600"},{"name":"David Blaauw","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Blaauw","id":"37276099100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757418","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Inverters","Capacitors","Robustness","Random access memory","Method of moments","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","preamplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable sense amplifier","auto-zero calibration","variation-tolerant small-signal differential sensing scheme","SA circuit","autozeroing offset compensation","bitline differential pre-amplification","SA inverter","amplified voltage differential latching","cross-coupled configuration","CMOS test chip","iso-area VTS scheme","offset noise tolerance","size 28 nm"]}],"abstract":"This work presents an area-efficient and variation-tolerant small-signal differential sensing (VTS) scheme that modifies the conventional SA circuit to include: 1) a structure for on-the-fly, auto-zeroing offset compensation, 2) pre-amplification of bitline differential by reconfiguring the SA inverter pair as amplifiers, and 3) latching of the amplified voltage differential by returning the SA to its conventional cross-coupled configuration.

To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA), the trend is towards Class-AB and Class-B PAs that exhibit better energy efficiency compared to Class-A.

This makes it possible to use both NMOS and PMOS transistors at mm-Wave frequencies. This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors.

Such camera implementations favor pixels with antenna-coupled direct detectors for a low power dissipation and a high pixel count. Despite this progress, they lack the required sensitivity for passive imaging and imagers are in the need of artificial illumination to provide the required image quality. The choice has been to use expensive high-power focused illumination with a single direction for the incoming beam, which seriously limits the image quality due to its specular nature. Additionally, detectors in a focal-plane array configuration share the available source power and the image SNR further drops with the camera resolution. Like imaging at visible light, where shades or reflectors are commonly used, active THz imaging would greatly benefit from incoherent artificial light sources to adjust brightness, phase/frequency, and the direction of light to obtain the desired lighting conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757424","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757424.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"14.5 A 0.53THz reconfigurable source array with up to 1mW radiated power for terahertz imaging applications in 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"14.5 A 0.53THz reconfigurable source array with up to 1mW radiated power for terahertz imaging applications in 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757424/","accessionNumber":"14147467","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"14.5 A 0.53THz reconfigurable source array with up to 1mW radiated power for terahertz imaging applications in 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076115S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757425,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya Tousi","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Tousi","id":"37545891600"},{"name":"Ehsan Afshari","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Afshari","id":"37398473500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757425","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2027},"abstract":"In traditional phased arrays as the number of rows and columns increases, the complexity of array connections and phase shifters becomes a major obstacle. This challenge is even more detrimental at mm-Wave and THz frequencies where conductive loss, undesired couplings, phase/gain mismatch, and high power consumption are among many adverse effects of such lengthy connections. To address this issue, this work presents a novel scalable system for THz signal generation and radiation. Figure 14.6.1 shows the architecture consisting of a 2-D array of coupled oscillating elements. Each oscillator with its antenna forms a small THz radiator. While independently radiating, each element is also unidirectionally connected to its neighboring elements in both horizontal and vertical directions through variable phase shifters, \u03c8row and \u03c8col, respectively. This network is inherently scalable because it only relies on couplings with the nearest neighbors and there is no high-frequency global routing to any oscillator. The purpose of this topology is twofold: first to synchronize all the oscillators to a single frequency and next, to set a desired phase shift between the adjacent elements (\u0394\u03c6row and \u0394\u03c6col). We can show that by employing this particular coupling structure only a small subset of all the theoretical coupling modes are physically stable. By proper control of the couplings one can ensure the system settles into the desired coupling mode [1].","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Antenna

power-supply-rejection ratio (PSRR) to maintain VCO phase noise. However, the voltage dropout of an LDO consumes extra power and voltage headroom, which is unacceptable in low-voltage design. Moreover, the device noise from the LDO degrades the phase-noise performance. Recently published works [1-5] employ analog compensation techniques to lower supply sensitivity, and [2] incorporates a hybrid background calibration scheme for robustness. However, the additional current sources and active devices embedded in the oscillator [1-5] increase power and noise. In this work, a DCO with passive devices and all-digital calibration mitigates supply sensitivity under PVT variation, while maintaining phase noise and power consumption. The digital background-calibration logic regulates the oscillator supply to an optimally insensitive point by monitoring a digital loop filter (DLF) code, leveraging an advantage of an ADPLL [6].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757430/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14147626","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"15.3 A 2.4GHz ADPLL with digital-regulated supply-noise-insensitive and temperature-self-compensated ring DCO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"15.3 A 2.4GHz ADPLL with digital-regulated supply-noise-insensitive and temperature-self-compensated ring DCO","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046215S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6757431,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Elkholy","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elkholy","id":"37085380757"},{"name":"Amr Elshazly","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Elshazly","id":"37589992800"},{"name":"Saurabh Saxena","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Saxena","id":"38467238600"},{"name":"Guanghua Shu","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Guanghua","lastName":"Shu","id":"37542066700"},{"name":"Pavan Kumar Hanumolu","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Pavan Kumar","lastName":"Hanumolu","id":"37277129200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757431","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2443},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Clocks","Delays","Calibration","Phase locked loops","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","digital phase locked loops","direct digital synthesis","jitter","time-digital conversion","UHF oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DDS","closed-loop PLL","all-digital CGU","open-loop fractional dividers","instantaneous frequency switching","direct-digital synthesis","open-loop frequency generation","SSC modulation frequency","low-noise oscillator","high-resolution TDC","oscillator phase noise","fractional-divider quantization error","time-to-digital converter","digital fractional-N PLL-based CGU","analog integer-N phase-loced loop-based CGU","analog integer-N PLL-based clock generation unit","rapid power cycling","EMI","electromagnetic interference","spread spectrum clocking","DFS","dynamic frequency scaling","wireless transceivers","power management","I-O interfaces","memories","multicore processors","SoC","systems-on-chips","frequency 20 MHz to 1000 MHz","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"Modern systems-on-chips (SoCs) perform many diverse analog, digital, and mixed-signal functions. They contain a wide variety of modules such as multicore processors, memories, I/O interfaces, power management, and wireless transceivers. Each module has its own unique clock requirements to maximize the overall system performance. For example, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) saves processor power, spread spectrum clocking (SSC) reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), and rapid power cycling between idle and active states allows energy-proportional operation. A conventional analog integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL)-based clock generation unit (CGU) occupies large area, has a long lock time, and its output frequency resolution is limited by the reference clock frequency. While the digital fractional-N PLL-based CGU in [1] overcomes some of these drawbacks, it suffers from an intrinsic tradeoff between the time-to-digital converter (TDC)/fractional-divider quantization error and oscillator phase noise. As a result, it requires either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator both of which incur power penalty. Further, narrow PLL bandwidth limits SSC modulation frequency and increases lock time making it unsuitable for energy-proportional operation. Open-loop frequency generation using direct-digital synthesis (DDS) overcomes the drawbacks of closed-loop PLLs but it consumes a significant amount of power [2]. This paper presents an all-digital CGU using open-loop fractional dividers. Unlike [1], the proposed CGU, using only one integer-N PLL and a single reference clock, can provide multiple low-jitter outputs over a wide frequency range with fine frequency resolution. It also has SSC capability with programmable modulation depth and achieves instantaneous frequency switching.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757431","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757431.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"272","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"15.4 A 20-to-1000MHz \u00b114ps peak-to-peak jitter reconfigurable multi-output all-digital clock generator using open-loop fractional dividers in 65nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"15.4 A 20-to-1000MHz \u00b114ps peak-to-peak jitter reconfigurable multi-output all-digital clock generator using open-loop fractional dividers in 65nm CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757431/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147659","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757431/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"15.4 A 20-to-1000MHz \u00b114ps peak-to-peak jitter reconfigurable multi-output all-digital clock generator using open-loop fractional dividers in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080314S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757432,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Chen","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536179800"},{"name":"Mark A.

As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching. Circuit switching removes intra-route data storage, but suffers from low network utilization due to serialized channel setup and data transfer [2]. Hybrid packet/circuit switching parallelizes these operations for higher network utilization. A 16\u00d716 mesh, 112b data, 256 voltage/clock domain NoC with source-synchronous operation, hybrid packet/circuit-switched flow control, and ultra-low-voltage optimizations is fabricated in 22nm tri-gate CMOS [3] to enable: i) 20.2Tb/s total throughput at 0.9V, 25\u00b0C, ii) a 2.7\u00d7 increase in bisection bandwidth to 2.8Tb/s and 93% reduction in circuit-switched latency at 407ps/hop through source-synchronous operation, iii) a 62% latency improvement and 55% increase in energy efficiency to 7.0Tb/s/W through circuit switching, iv) a peak energy efficiency of 18.3Tb/s/W for near-threshold operation at 430mV, 25\u00b0C, and v) ultra-low-voltage operation down to 340mV with router power scaling to 363\u03bcW.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757432","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757432.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757432","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","startPage":"276","endPage":"277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16.1 A 340mV-to-0.9V 20.2Tb/s source-synchronous hybrid packet/circuit-switched 16\u00d716 network-on-chip in 22nm tri-gate CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"16.1 A 340mV-to-0.9V 20.2Tb/s source-synchronous hybrid packet/circuit-switched 16\u00d716 network-on-chip in 22nm tri-gate CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757432/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757432/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147475","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16.1 A 340mV-to-0.9V 20.2Tb/s source-synchronous hybrid packet/circuit-switched 16\u00d716 network-on-chip in 22nm tri-gate CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041002S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6757433,"authors":[{"name":"Sanu K.

Although hardware TRNGs provide excellent randomness, power consumption and design complexity are often high. Previous work has demonstrated TRNGs based on a resistor-amplifier-ADC chain [2], oscillator jitter [1], metastability [3-5] and other device noise [6-7]. However, analog designs suffer from variation and noise, making them difficult to integrate with digital circuits. Recent metastability-based methods [3-5] provide excellent performance but often require careful calibration to remove bias. SiN MOSFETs [6] exploit larger thermal noise but require post-processing to achieve sufficient randomness. An oxide breakdown-based TRNG [7] shows high entropy but suffers from low performance and high energy/bit. Ring oscillator (RO)-based TRNGs offer the advantage of design simplicity, but previous methods using a slow jittery clock to sample a fast clock provide low randomness [1] and are vulnerable to power supply attacks [8]. In addition, the majority of previous methods cannot pass all NIST randomness tests.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757434","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"280","endPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16.3 A 23Mb/s 23pJ/b fully synthesized true-random-number generator in 28nm and 65nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"16.3 A 23Mb/s 23pJ/b fully synthesized true-random-number generator in 28nm and 65nm CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757434/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147622","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16.3 A 23Mb/s 23pJ/b fully synthesized true-random-number generator in 28nm and 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033803S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757436,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Ma","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085573992"},{"name":"Ronan van der Zee","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"van der Zee","id":"37426970200"},{"name":"Bram Nauta","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Nauta","id":"37274378900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757436","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757436","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Switches","Rails","Semiconductor device measurement","Solid state circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency control","piezoelectric actuators","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-D power amplifier","optimal-efficiency-tracking switching frequency regulation","piezoelectric actuators","smart materials","vibration control","noise control","precision actuators","reactive power","power efficiency","voltage 80 V","power 45 W"]}],"abstract":"Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in smart materials for vibration and noise control, precision actuators, etc. [1].

The approach applies feedback theory and simplifies high-frequency Miller amplifiers, thereby reducing orders of circuits and improving insight.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757438/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147539","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"17.3 A 0.9V 6.3\u03bcW multistage amplifier driving 500pF capacitive load with 1.34MHz GBW","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"17.3 A 0.9V 6.3\u03bcW multistage amplifier driving 500pF capacitive load with 1.34MHz GBW","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040653S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6757439,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Ferrari","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37268171500"},{"name":"Davide Bianchi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37089129796"},{"name":"Angelo Rottigni","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Rottigni","id":"37706683900"},{"name":"Marco Sampietro","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Sampietro","id":"37319493300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757439","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":563},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Frequency modulation","Noise","Resistors","Computer architecture","Frequency measurement","Feedback loop"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","convertors","electric impedance measurement","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS impedance analyzer","nanosamples investigation","electrical parameter","physical parameter","impedance spectroscopy","current-admittance converter","frequency 1 kHz to 150 MHz"]}],"abstract":"Impedance analyzers find an important role in nanoscience and in biological research as a tool to access electrical and physical parameters of the matter as well as to enhance the read-out performance in sensor applications. Needs are emerging to perform impedance spectroscopy on a wide frequency range. Electrical assessment of the cell metabolism, for example, requires a frequency of investigation of about 100 MHz for the signal to traverse the cell membrane and to access the cytoplasm. Bench-top impedance analyzers exist that cover such a wide frequency range but they are bulky, expensive and have inadequate resolution for the high impedance shown by many nanosamples and semi-insulating biological molecules. Recent compact analyzers based on custom CMOS chips are mainly focused on low-power solutions with sub-MHz ranges or highly multichannel applications. Here we present a fully-integrated current-to-admittance converter operating from 1kHz to 150MHz with the low noise level of other solutions operating at much lower frequencies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757439","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757439.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"293","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"17.4 CMOS impedance analyzer for nanosamples investigation operating up to 150MHz with Sub-aF resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"17.4 CMOS impedance analyzer for nanosamples investigation operating up to 150MHz with Sub-aF resolution","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757439/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147472","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757439/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"17.4 CMOS impedance analyzer for nanosamples investigation operating up to 150MHz with Sub-aF resolution","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056887S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6757440,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Sebastiano","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors NV, Eindhoven, North Brabant, NL"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Sebastiano","id":"37567267500"},{"name":"Federico Butti","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Butti","id":"37706246700"},{"name":"Robert van Veldhoven","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"van Veldhoven","id":"37545668300"},{"name":"Paolo Bruschi","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Bruschi","id":"37268863100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1024},"abstract":"Extremely small-area sensor front-ends are required for cost-constrained automotive applications.

user's daily routine. To truly support emerging applications (Fig. 18.3.1), a generic platform is needed that can acquire a multitude of sensor modalities and has generic energy-efficient signal processing capabilities. SoC technology gives significant advantages for miniaturization. But meeting low-power, medical grade signal quality, multi-sensor support and generic signal processing is still a challenge. For instance, [1] demonstrated a multi-sensor interface but it lacks support for efficient on-chip signal processing and doesn't have a high performance AFE. [2] showed a very low power signal processor but without support for multi-sensor interfacing. [3] presented a highly integrated SoC but lacking power efficiency. This paper demonstrates a highly integrated low-power SoC with enough flexibility to support many emerging applications. A wide range of sensor modalities are supported including 3-lead ECG and bio-impedance via high-performance and low-power AFE. The ARM Cortex\u2122 M0 processor and matrix-multiply-accumulate accelerator can execute numerous biomedical signal processing algorithms (e.g. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA,) CWT, feature extraction/classification, etc.) in an energy efficient way without sacrificing flexibility. The diversity in supported modalities and the generic processing capabilities, all provided in a single-chip low-power solution, make the proposed SoC a key enabler for emerging personal health applications (Fig. 18.3.1).","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757449","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers

conventional planar NAND Flash [1-3]. The difficulties include shrinking the NAND cell and increasing manufacturing costs due to quadruple patterning and extreme ultraviolet lithography, motivating the development of the next-generation node beyond 16nm-class NAND Flash [4]. In this paper, as a new 3D memory device with lower manufacturing cost and superior device scalability, we present a true 3D 128Gb 2b/cell vertical-NAND (V-NAND) Flash. The chip accomplishes 50MB/s write throughput with 3K endurance for typical embedded applications such as mobile and personal computer. Also, extended endurance of 35K is achieved with 33MB/s of write throughput for data center and enterprise SSD applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757458","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757458.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"19.5 Three-dimensional 128Gb MLC vertical NAND Flash-memory with 24-WL stacked layers and 50MB/s high-speed programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"19.5 Three-dimensional 128Gb MLC vertical NAND Flash-memory with 24-WL stacked layers and 50MB/s high-speed programming","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757458/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147485","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"19.5 Three-dimensional 128Gb MLC vertical NAND Flash-memory with 24-WL stacked layers and 50MB/s high-speed programming","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D1905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142851S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757459,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhei Tanakamaru","affiliation":["Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Tanakamaru","id":"37393263900"},{"name":"Hiroki Yamazawa","affiliation":["Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Yamazawa","id":"37085450487"},{"name":"Tsukasa Tokutomi","affiliation":["Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsukasa","lastName":"Tokutomi","id":"37085431679"},{"name":"Sheyang Ning","affiliation":["Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Sheyang","lastName":"Ning","id":"37073387900"},{"name":"Ken Takeuchi","affiliation":["Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37323717800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757459","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":883},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Flash memories","Reliability","Video recording","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","NAND circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid ReRAM-TLC NAND flash storage","RAID-5/6","cloud data centers","hybrid storage architecture","reliability","storage controller","minimal area overhead","adaptive asymmetric coding","AAC","verify trials reduction","VTR","bit-error rate","BER","bits-cell optimization","BCO","failure rate reduction","size 50 nm"]}],"abstract":"A hybrid storage architecture of ReRAM and TLC (3b/cell) NAND Flash with RAID-5/6 is developed to meet cloud data-center requirements of reliability, speed and capacity.

By using a 4-bonded channel, 28.16Gb/s can be transmitted in 16QAM. The front-end consumes 251mW and 220mW from a 1.2-V supply in transmitting and receiving mode, respectively. Figure 20.3.1 shows the 60GHz direct-conversion front-end design. The transmitter consists of a 6-stage PA, differential preamplifiers, I/Q passive mixers and a quadrature injection-locked oscillator (QILO). The receiver consists of a 4-stage LNA, differential amplifiers, I/Q double-balanced mixers, a QILO, and baseband amplifiers. A direct-conversion architecture is employed for both TX and RX because of wide-bandwidth capability [1]. The LO consists of the 60GHz QILO and a 20GHz PLL. The 60GHz QILO works as a frequency tripler with the integrated 20GHz PLL. It can generate 7 carrier frequencies with a 36/40MHz reference, 58.32GHz(ch.1), 60.48GHz(ch.2), 62.64GHz(ch.3), and 64.80GHz(ch.4) defined in IEEE802.11ad/WiGig, 59.40GHz(ch.1-2), 61.56GHz(ch.2-3),

A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues. However, by limiting the application to high-throughput proximity transmission, thermal issues arising in a single-chip have been overcome. A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than -35dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes. The average power consumption at a throughput of 0.2Gb/s is reduced to 36% of that at 2.0Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757464","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits

networks has resulted in emerging standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. By employing spatial diversity, Multi-user MIMO and high-density modulation (up to 256-QAM), 802.11ac MIMO radios can provide significantly increased throughput, link robustness, and range while maintaining backward-compatibilities with existing 802.11a/n WLAN [1]. However, wide signal bandwidth and high-density modulation lead to significant challenges in all aspects of RF transceiver design, compared to previous WLAN standards. This paper introduces a fully integrated 3-stream MIMO WLAN SoC that integrates all of the functions of an 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WLAN with a record over-the-air TCP/IP throughput of 1.1Gb/s. The 40nm CMOS SoC integrates dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) RF transceivers, data converters, digital physical layer, media access controller, and a PCI Express Gen-2 interface. The RF transceiver employs an all-digital fractional-N PLL with a record Figure-of-Merit (FoM) of -244dB, a wideband low-impedance bias circuit that minimizes pre-PA driver memory effect for 80MHz signal bandwidth, a dual-band receiver with 3dB/4.3dB NF, and a 5\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n-order Chebyshev low-pass filter with constant-G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n bias and pre-distorted filter coefficients to support up to 80MHz signal bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757465","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757465.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"20.5 A 40nm dual-band 3-stream 802.11a/b/g/n/ac MIMO WLAN SoC with 1.1Gb/s over-the-air throughput","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757465/","displayDocTitle":"20.5 A 40nm dual-band 3-stream 802.11a/b/g/n/ac MIMO WLAN SoC with 1.1Gb/s over-the-air throughput","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147643","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757465/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"20.5 A 40nm dual-band 3-stream 802.11a/b/g/n/ac MIMO WLAN SoC with 1.1Gb/s over-the-air throughput","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081121S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757467,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Da Tsai","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Da","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37086754573"},{"name":"Chih-Fan Liao","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Fan","lastName":"Liao","id":"38236848300"},{"name":"Chi-Yun Wang","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086759624"},{"name":"Yi-Bin Lee","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Bin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37579192700"},{"name":"Bosen Tzeng","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bosen","lastName":"Tzeng","id":"37283093600"},{"name":"Guang-Kaai Dehng","affiliation":["MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guang-Kaai","lastName":"Dehng","id":"37283088000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757467","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1480},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757467","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Noise measurement","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Bandwidth","Spread spectrum communication","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel allocation","CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","inductors","integrated circuit packaging","next generation networks","operational amplifiers","surface acoustic waves","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transimpedance amplifier","dynamic gain-bandwidth-product-extension circuit","PGA","baseband CR filter","3G TD-SCDMA dual bands","receiver supporting 2G quad bands","4G","wider channel bandwidth","cellular standards","cellular phone networks","high-speed wireless communication","CMOS","multiband inductor less SAW-less 2G/3G-TD-SCDMA cellular receiver","size 40 nm"]}],"abstract":"The growing demand for high-speed wireless communication has driven the evolution of cellular phone networks.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757474.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Coils","Inductors","Phase noise","Tuning","Magnetic fields","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","CMOS integrated circuits","magnetic fields","microwave integrated circuits","phase locked loops","UHF integrated circuits","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio IC","tank inductor","phase locked loops","PLL","inductor coil","magnetic fields","power consumption","phase noise","cellular communications","concentric 8-shaped coils","VCO","voltage-controlled oscillators","dual-core CMOS","frequency 2.4 GHz to 5.3 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147581","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046718S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6757476,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Mirzaei","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Mirzaei","id":"37293920300"},{"name":"Mohyee Mikhemar","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Mohyee","lastName":"Mikhemar","id":"37545624900"},{"name":"Hooman Darabi","affiliation":["Broadcom, Irvine, CA"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Darabi","id":"37275521400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757476","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1081},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Calibration","Frequency modulation","Phase locked loops","Transmitters","Amplitude modulation","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","phase locked loops","radio transmitters","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulling mitigation technique","direct-conversion transmitters","calibration scheme","fully digital approach","automatically calibrated approach","power consumption","size","transmitter noise","VCO","PLL"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"21.8 A pulling mitigation technique for direct-conversion transmitters","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757476.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757476","startPage":"374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757476","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2]. As shown in Fig. 21.8.1, the pulled oscillator spectrum is no longer a single-tone sinusoid, which can drastically degrade the transmitter EVM or spectrum mask. To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption. Moreover, in many modern radios it is common to have more than one VCO on-chip (Fig. 21.8.1) to support various features such as FDD, carrier aggregation, or coexistence, further exacerbating the problem through multiple-VCO cross-coupling. To address these concerns we propose a calibration scheme that corrects any pulling effect regardless of its source or magnitude. Our approach is fully digital and is automatically calibrated, leading to a reliable and robust solution, and has little impact on power consumption, size, or transmitter noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14147550","htmlLink":"/document/6757476/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"21.8 A pulling mitigation technique for direct-conversion transmitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"21.8 A pulling mitigation technique for direct-conversion transmitters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038754S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6757477,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Kull","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Kull","id":"37680744200"},{"name":"Thomas Toifl","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Toifl","id":"37283681200"},{"name":"Martin Schmatz","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schmatz","id":"37271115900"},{"name":"Pier Andrea Francese","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pier Andrea","lastName":"Francese","id":"37275750200"},{"name":"Christian Menolfi","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Menolfi","id":"37283682000"},{"name":"Matthias Braendli","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Braendli","id":"38072684200"},{"name":"Marcel Kossel","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Kossel","id":"37271117700"},{"name":"Thomas Morf","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Morf","id":"37266745500"},{"name":"Toke Meyer Andersen","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Toke Meyer","lastName":"Andersen","id":"38515537500"},{"name":"Yusuf Leblebici","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Leblebici","id":"37085363266"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757477","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":6178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757477","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Clocks","Frequency measurement","Bandwidth","Linearity","Transistors","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved SAR ADC","digital SOI CMOS","optical communication","high speed ADC","moderate resolution ADC","analog-digital converter","successive approximation register","power 667 mW","size 32 nm"]}],"abstract":"Forthcoming optical communication standards such as ITU OTU-4 and 100/400Gb/s Ethernet require ADCs with more than 50GS/s and at least 5 ENOB to enable complex equalization in the digital domain.

First CMOS ADCs with at least 6b and conversion rates exceeding 20GS/s were presented, proving that interleaved SAR ADCs are an optimal choice for high-speed ADCs with moderate resolution.

For applications requiring low phase noise - e.g., cellular, GPS and high-speed serial links - one possible approach is to bias the MEMS resonator at a higher DC voltage to reduce its motional impedance and increase signal energy [2]. Realizing high-voltage charge pumps in bulk CMOS technology is limited by the breakdown voltage of the well/substrate diodes shown in Fig. 23.8.1(a) and Fig. 23.8.1(b). This breakdown limit is even lower with technology scaling and is <;10V in a 22nm CMOS node. Systems with high-voltage requirements often resort to older, high-voltage-tolerant nodes or exotic technologies that limit MEMS integration into SoCs. This work demonstrates a charge pump design in 65nm technology with a three-fold increase in the output voltage range. Highvoltage tolerance is enabled by the proposed well-biasing arrangement and oxide isolation. The pump achieves 34V output by using three different charge pump cells that tradeoff achievable voltage range and power efficiency to achieve a peak efficiency of 38%. Additionally, finger capacitors are optimized to ensure reliability while maintaining efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757491","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"408","endPage":"409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 34V charge pump in 65nm bulk CMOS technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 34V charge pump in 65nm bulk CMOS technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757491/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147508","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 34V charge pump in 65nm bulk CMOS technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045043S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757494,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsuk Jeon","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Dongsuk","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37720969000"},{"name":"Yen-Po Chen","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Yen-Po","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085418106"},{"name":"Yoonmyung Lee","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Yoonmyung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600714600"},{"name":"Yejoong Kim","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Yejoong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37965798900"},{"name":"Zhiyoong Foo","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Zhiyoong","lastName":"Foo","id":"37393211900"},{"name":"Grant Kruger","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Grant","lastName":"Kruger","id":"38469558600"},{"name":"Hakan Oral","affiliation":["University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Oral","id":"37085420614"},{"name":"Omer Berenfeld","affiliation":["University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Berenfeld","id":"37945192000"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Zhengya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088720814"},{"name":"David Blaauw","affiliation":["University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Blaauw","id":"37276099100"},{"name":"Dennis Sylvester","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arborz, MI"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Sylvester","id":"37274874600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757494","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2030},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Noise","System-on-chip","Monitoring","Power demand","Batteries","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","body sensor networks","diseases","electrocardiography","medical disorders","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implantable ECG-monitoring mixed-signal SoC","arrhythmia diagnosis","electrocardiography","heart disorders","arrhythmia treatment","body-wearable systems","body movement","noise sources","electrodes","low power consumption","power 64 nW","frequency 60 Hz"]}],"abstract":"Electrocardiography (ECG) is a critical source of information for a number of heart disorders.

However, even small body-wearable systems can impact a patient's everyday life and signals captured using such systems are prone to noise from sources such as 60Hz power and body movement. In contrast, implanted devices are less susceptible to these noise sources and, while having closer-spaced electrodes, can obtain similar quality ECG signals due to their proximity to the heart [1]. In addition, implanted devices enable continuous monitoring without affecting patient quality of life. As in other implantable systems, low power consumption is a critical factor; in this case to provide a sufficiently long operating time between wireless recharge events.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757494","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757494.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"24.3 An implantable 64nW ECG-monitoring mixed-signal SoC for arrhythmia diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757494/","displayDocTitle":"24.3 An implantable 64nW ECG-monitoring mixed-signal SoC for arrhythmia diagnosis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147532","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757494/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"24.3 An implantable 64nW ECG-monitoring mixed-signal SoC for arrhythmia diagnosis","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051225S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757495,"authors":[{"name":"Long Yan","affiliation":["imec, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Yan","id":"38580709300"},{"name":"Pieter Harpe","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Harpe","id":"37299089900"},{"name":"Masato Osawa","affiliation":["Olympus, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Osawa","id":"38581139700"},{"name":"Yasunari Harada","affiliation":["Olympus, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunari","lastName":"Harada","id":"38580448200"},{"name":"Kosei Tamiya","affiliation":["Olympus, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kosei","lastName":"Tamiya","id":"38581084600"},{"name":"Chris Van Hoof","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Van Hoof"},{"name":"Refet Firat Yazicioglu","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Refet Firat","lastName":"Yazicioglu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757495","dbTime":"65 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1945},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronics packaging","Feature extraction","Electrocardiography","Multiplexing","Integrated circuits","Noise","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","electrocardiography","feature extraction","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","pacemakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power heartbeat detection","flexible ADC","current-multiplexed ADC driver","power-efficient analog feature extraction","ASP","analog signal processor","analog back ends","current biomedical IC","DSP","computational complexity minimization","heartbeat detection","system-level power consumption","analog domain","QRS-band power parameter extraction","power saving","cardiac rhythm disorders","sensing IC","implantable pacemakers","design requirement","size miniaturation","ultralow-power consumption","fully-integrated implantable ECG-acquisition IC"]}],"abstract":"Ultra-low power consumption and miniature size are by far the most important design requirements for implantable pacemakers. In order to guarantee a long life span of the device, saving power in the sensing IC is a primary concern as cardiac rhythm disorders must be continuously monitored [1]. Shifting the functionality of QRS-band power parameter extraction to the analog domain can reduce system-level power consumption of heartbeat detection significantly through minimizing computational complexity of the DSP [2,3]. In addition, current biomedical ICs still require further improvement of power efficiency as their analog back ends consume significant power [2-4]. For low-power means, the presented analog signal processor (ASP) introduces a power-efficient analog feature extraction, a current-multiplexed ADC driver and a flexible ADC. This advances the state of the art by reducing the power consumption of the ASP below 1\u03bcW without compromising other specs, such as input SNR >70dB, CMRR >90dB, PSRR >80dB, and enables low-power heartbeat detection for implantable pacemakers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"24.4 A 680nA fully integrated implantable ECG-acquisition IC with analog feature extraction","publicationTitle":"2014

(ISSCC)","abstract":"Ultrasound imaging is widely used for medical diagnosis, because it is harmless to the human body and has real-time processing capability. Usually the focusing (beamforming) operation is performed for both TX and RX. The RX focusing is performed by an RX beamformer [1-5], which consists of delay elements and adders. Nowadays, digital beamformers (DBF) are mostly used for conventional ultrasound imaging because of high SNR. Recently, 2D ultrasound transducers have been introduced for 3D imaging. Since the 2D transducer has a huge number of transducer elements (e.g., 9216 for a 72\u00d7128 array), it cannot use DBF because of the huge number of required ADCs and wires inside the probe cable. Therefore, analog beamforming must be performed, at least at the front stage of the 2D transducer.In this work, where a 2D CMUT array is used, the maximum delay difference among transducer elements is 8\u03bcs with a maximum steering angle of 45\u00b0 and a maximum focal depth of 15cm. The target sampling resolution is 6.25ns (\u03bbc / 53.3) with a carrier frequency of 3MHz. An analog-digital-hybrid architecture and a non-uniform sampling scheme are used for the RX beamformer of this work to achieve the wide dynamic range of delay time and small chip-area. The RX beamformer consists of 8 analog beamformers (ABF) followed by a single DBF, as shown in Fig. 24.8.1. An ABF performs the focusing operation for the input signals of the adjacent 8 channels to generate an analog output signal. The 8 analog output signals from the 8 ABFs are applied to the DBF. The DBF converts the 8 analog input signals into the 8 digital signals, and then performs the focusing operation on the 8 digital signals to generate a digital output signal for every focal point.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"426","endPage":"427","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International

for high-performance systems. Wide-I/O memory and GDDR5 are two types of high-bandwidth memories. GDDR5 is more compatible than wide I/O for contemporary systems, such as graphics cards and game consoles. The datarate of GDDR5 has reached 7Gb/s/pin. However, the power consumption and cost have increased owing to high-performance-oriented designs, die penalties, and additional test costs. DDR4 is an alternative low-cost memory with high performance in the range of 2.4 to 3.2Gb/s/pin [1]. However it is difficult for DDR4 DRAM to raise the 3.2Gb/s/pin bin portion to lower the cost. In DRAMs, the standby power and self-refresh power are more important than the operating power because DRAMs are mainly in the standby or self-refresh mode in systems. As the operating speed increases, the data window is narrowed, and the jitter increases. Therefore, a duty-cycle corrector (DCC) is employed to increase the data window when the external clock duty cycle is distorted in GDDR5 [2]. The bang-bang jitter caused by the DCC is inevitable even if the external clock duty ratio is exactly 50%. Sometimes the DCC may distort the data window because of an internal DCC offset. This paper presents a GDDR5M (mainstream) memory for graphics cards and a small-outline dual-inline memory module (SO-DIMM). The standby power is managed by the auto-sync mode. Additionally, the architecture of GDDR5M is similar to that of DDR4, and not GDDR5. The error-adaptive DCC can remove the initial duty-cycle offset automatically and remove the bang-bang jitter when the duty cycle of the external clock is not distorted.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757502","startPage":"434","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757502.pdf","endPage":"435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757502/","displayDocTitle":"25.3 A 1.35V 5.0Gb/s/pin GDDR5M with 5.4mW standby power and an error-adaptive duty-cycle corrector","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757502/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14147554","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"25.3 A 1.35V 5.0Gb/s/pin GDDR5M with 5.4mW standby power and an error-adaptive duty-cycle corrector","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065109S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757503,"authors":[{"name":"Vishnu Balan","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Vishnu","lastName":"Balan","id":"37282491400"},{"name":"Olakanmi Oluwole","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Olakanmi","lastName":"Oluwole","id":"37085572536"},{"name":"Gregory Kodani","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Kodani","id":"37085571652"},{"name":"Charlie Zhong","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Charlie","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37586056800"},{"name":"Sanjeev Maheswari","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Maheswari","id":"37088714663"},{"name":"Ratnakar Dadi","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Ratnakar","lastName":"Dadi","id":"37550564600"},{"name":"Arif Amin","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Amin","id":"37085583543"},{"name":"Gautam Bhatia","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Gautam","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37088715064"},{"name":"Peter Mills","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Mills","id":"37088719269"},{"name":"Ahmed Ragab","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Ragab","id":"38466670700"},{"name":"Edward Lee","affiliation":["nVidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088714113"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757503","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1659},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Latches","CMOS integrated circuits","Clocks","Decision feedback equalizers","Bandwidth","Finite impulse response filters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","flip-chip devices","low-power electronics","MMIC oscillators","phase locked loops","printed circuit interconnections","transceivers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-duplex serial link","GPUs","CPUs","clock rate","processing power","chip-to-chip communication","I/O bandwidth","I/O pin limitations","high chip-to-chip bandwidth","channel losses","impedance discontinuities","high data rates","reliable differential bidirectional links","FR4 PCB trace","flip-chip packages","half-duplex link","fast bias circuits","top-level transceiver architecture","LC-VCO-based PLL","quadrature I/Q clocks","half-rate architecture","on-chip transmission line","power 130 mW","bit rate 20 Gbit/s","loss 20 dB","frequency 20 GHz","size 28 nm","frequency 10 GHz"]}],"abstract":"As the processing power and clock rate of CPUs and GPUs increase, there is a need for increased I/O bandwidth to enable chip-to-chip communication. I/O pin limitations demand faster links at low power to enable integration of high chip-to-chip bandwidth. However, the channel losses and impedance discontinuities increase at high data rates making it difficult to equalize the channel at low power. In this work, we target reliable, differential, bi-directional links at 20 Gb/s over 6\u201d FR4 PCB trace and flip-chip packages with a total loss budget of 20 dB at Nyquist. In a half-duplex link, one TX and RX are connected on each side and the link direction can be turned around by the controller. A link-turnaround latency of <;10 ns is achieved by placing several key circuits on standby when not in use and by designing fast bias circuits. When fast turnaround is not required, the circuits not in use are powered down permanently and the link is reduced to the simplex case. The top-level transceiver architecture is shown. An LC-VCO-based PLL oscillates at 20 GHz and generates quadrature I/Q clocks at 10 GHz. Both TX and RX use a half-rate architecture to optimize power. The clocks are distributed through an on-chip transmission line to 16 I/O lanes arranged in 2 rows. The links are capable of data rates as low as 14 Gb/s to save power when full bandwidth is not required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"26.1 A 130mW 20Gb/s half-duplex serial link in 28nm CMOS","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757503","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757503.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"26.1 A 130mW 20Gb/s half-duplex serial link in 28nm CMOS","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757503/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14156475","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"26.1 A 130mW 20Gb/s half-duplex serial link in 28nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044516S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757506,"authors":[{"name":"Tzu-Chien Hsueh","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Tzu-Chien","lastName":"Hsueh","id":"37544496500"},{"name":"Ganesh Balamurugan","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Balamurugan","id":"37273622100"},{"name":"James Jaussi","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Jaussi","id":"37273622200"},{"name":"Sami Hyvonen","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Hyvonen","id":"37294664300"},{"name":"Joseph Kennedy","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37276103300"},{"name":"Gokce Keskin","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Gokce","lastName":"Keskin","id":"37293805100"},{"name":"Tawfiq Musah","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Tawfiq","lastName":"Musah","id":"37393281000"},{"name":"Sudip Shekhar","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Shekhar","id":"37272375800"},{"name":"Rajesh Inti","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Inti","id":"37589975800"},{"name":"Shreyas Sen","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Shreyas","lastName":"Sen","id":"37322064300"},{"name":"Mozhgan Mansuri","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Mozhgan","lastName":"Mansuri","id":"37332639600"},{"name":"Clark Roberts","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Clark","lastName":"Roberts","id":"37603835300"},{"name":"Bryan Casper","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Casper","id":"37273619900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757506","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2678},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Calibration","CMOS integrated circuits","Regulators","Resistors","Solid state circuits","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","calibration","clocks","CMOS memory circuits","high-speed integrated circuits","integrated memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous digital sampling","digital clock-calibration techniques","reconfigurable logic","voltage-mode driver supply regulation","linearizing resistors","active devices","thin-gate-oxide devices","high-speed differential signaling","high-speed serial I/O enhancements","high-speed digital systems","memory configurations","CMOS","digital clock calibration","dual-mode transmitter","GDDR5","DDR4","bit rate 25.6 Gbit/s","size 22 nm","voltage 1.2 V","voltage 1.5 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757506","abstract":"A wide range of memory configurations exist in today's high-speed digital systems to meet platform-specific bandwidth, power, capacity, and cost constraints. In the near term, DDR4 and GDDR5 are expected to meet the needs of server, client, graphics and mobile platforms [1]. Differential signaling with high-speed serial I/O enhancements will potentially continue I/O performance scaling for post-DDR4 and future buffered memory solutions. A unified memory interface that can meet the signaling requirements of all these memory standards offers several benefits: reduced cost and design time, greater platform design flexibility, and a smoother transition from DDR4/GDDR5 to a high-speed differential memory interface [2]. This paper presents a dual-mode TX that supports single-ended (SE) 1.2V-DDR4/1.5V-GDDR5 (hereafter referred to as DDR-mode) as well as high-speed differential signaling (hereafter referred to as HSD-mode), which is implemented using only thin-gate-oxide devices in 22nm CMOS. Other key design features include: (a) a DDR4/GDDR5 driver implemented using only active devices (no linearizing resistors), (b) enhanced voltage-mode driver supply regulation, (c) reconfigurable logic to support pre-emphasis in both TX modes, and (d) low-overhead digital clock-calibration techniques based on asynchronous digital sampling (ADS) to improve calibration coverage and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757506","startPage":"444","endPage":"445","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757506.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"26.4 A 25.6Gb/s differential and DDR4/GDDR5 dual-mode transmitter with digital clock calibration in 22nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"26.4 A 25.6Gb/s differential and DDR4/GDDR5 dual-mode transmitter with digital clock calibration in 22nm CMOS","conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757506/","accessionNumber":"14147499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757506/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"26.4 A 25.6Gb/s differential and DDR4/GDDR5 dual-mode transmitter with digital clock calibration in 22nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.244606S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6757509,"authors":[{"name":"Robin Wilson","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37287751000"},{"name":"Edith Beigne","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Edith","lastName":"Beigne","id":"37316772200"},{"name":"Philippe Flatresse","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Flatresse","id":"37328781100"},{"name":"Alexandre Valentian","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Valentian","id":"37276602000"},{"name":"Fady Abouzeid","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Fady","lastName":"Abouzeid","id":"37543191900"},{"name":"Thomas Benoist","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Benoist","id":"38276980400"},{"name":"Christian Bernard","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37530508000"},{"name":"Sebastien Bernard","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Bernard","id":"38231241000"},{"name":"Olivier Billoint","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Billoint","id":"37397198400"},{"name":"Sylvain Clerc","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Clerc","id":"37443364600"},{"name":"Bastien Giraud","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Bastien","lastName":"Giraud","id":"37408563300"},{"name":"Anuj Grover","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Anuj","lastName":"Grover","id":"37072617400"},{"name":"Julien Le Coz","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Le Coz","id":"37542645600"},{"name":"Ivan Miro Panades","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Miro Panades","id":"37088706492"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Noel","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Noel","id":"37408065600"},{"name":"Bertrand Pelloux-Prayer","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Pelloux-Prayer","id":"38342949500"},{"name":"Philippe Roche","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Roche","id":"37281997800"},{"name":"Olivier Thomas","affiliation":["CEA-LETI - MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37276552200"},{"name":"Y.

Recent advances in signal processing have shown that, for such sparse signals, a new algorithm called the sparse FFT (sFFT) can compute the Fourier transform more efficiently than traditional FFTs [1].","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757512","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","startPage":"458","endPage":"459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"27.4 A 0.75-million-point fourier-transform chip for frequency-sparse signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"27.4 A 0.75-million-point fourier-transform chip for frequency-sparse signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147589","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"27.4 A 0.75-million-point fourier-transform chip for frequency-sparse signals","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061675S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6757514,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Chuan Ou","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Tai-Chuan","lastName":"Ou","id":"37085609239"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Zhengya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085610977"},{"name":"Marios C.

The IEEE 802.11ad standard for Gb/s wireless LANs in the 60GHz band requires an implementation of an LDPC encoder/decoder with throughputs of 1.5, 3, and 6Gb/s, with code rates of 1/2, 5/8, 3/4 and 13/16. Previous implementations of decoders for these throughputs and levels of reconfiguration have power consumptions on the order of the rest of the baseband processing. This paper presents a fully compatible IEEE 802.11ad LDPC decoder in 28 nm ultra-thin body and BOX fully-depleted SOI (UTBB FDSOI) technology with a power consumption that is a small fraction of the total baseband power. To achieve this, the decoder introduces an approximate marginalization technique and a simplified reconfiguration method. Forward body biasing of FDSOI technology allows for minimum energy consumption across all decoding modes.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757515","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747109/6757318/06757515.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"27.7 A scalable 1.5-to-6Gb/s 6.2-to-38.1mW LDPC decoder for 60GHz wireless networks in 28nm UTBB FDSOI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"27.7 A scalable 1.5-to-6Gb/s 6.2-to-38.1mW LDPC decoder for 60GHz wireless networks in 28nm UTBB FDSOI","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757515/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14147502","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757515/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"27.7 A scalable 1.5-to-6Gb/s 6.2-to-38.1mW LDPC decoder for 60GHz wireless networks in 28nm UTBB FDSOI","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSCC2014D2707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050639S","chronDate":"9-13 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6747109","isNumber":"6757318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747109","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6757318","articleId":"6757515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757521,"authors":[{"name":"Yunzhi Dong","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Yunzhi","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085405205"},{"name":"Richard Schreier","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Schreier","id":"37282693300"},{"name":"Wenhua Yang","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Wilmington, MA"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Yang","id":"38086444000"},{"name":"Sudhir Korrapati","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Wilmington, MA"],"firstName":"Sudhir","lastName":"Korrapati","id":"38097237000"},{"name":"Ali Sheikholeslami","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sheikholeslami","id":"37274725900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"6757521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1277},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757521","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Bandwidth","Clocks","Multi-stage noise shaping","Modulation","Computed tomography","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","continuous time systems","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CT 0-3 MASH ADC","wireless communication infrastructure","noise density","power consumption","noise spectral density","ADC architecture","LTE-A","continuous-time ADC","direct-conversion receiver","bandwidth 100 MHz","power 0.5 W","gain 10 dB"]}],"abstract":"The trend for ADCs in wireless communication infrastructure is increased bandwidth with little or no relaxation in noise density or power consumption.

The design of MAC protocols need to achieve the highest spectrum utilization by detecting all spectrum opportunities under fading environment of wireless channel and access without causing interference to primary users (PUs) while maximizing the amount of information transmitted (Throughput). We present in this paper a throughput optimization MAC scheme using cross-layer design concept which integrates the design of spectrum sensing at physical layer and sensing and access strategies at MAC layer while taking into account the channel quality in terms of fading level. We formulate a problem as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

The proposed scheme exploits wideband channel state information (CSI) in order to control CoMP transmission which reduces the required feedback compared to full CSI. Due to the spatial correlation of large-scale parameters of the mobile radio channel, wideband CSI is robust against outdating, thus applicable for scenarios with high user mobility. The coordination of precoder selection at adjacent base station (BS)-sites allows to shape the resulting spatial inter-cell interference pattern, i.e. the spatial distribution of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) in areas between individual cells. In this paper a baseline scheme is proposed, which selects individual precoders on orthogonal bandwidth resources in a coordinated fashion. It is shown via system-level simulations, that the proposed coordination scheme based on wide-band CSI improves system throuput for various user distributions and is robust against user equipment (UE) mobility.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757643","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-cell interference-coordination for distributed MIMO-systems based on wideband precoder selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inter-cell interference-coordination for distributed MIMO-systems based on wideband precoder selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757643/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147307","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757643/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-cell interference-coordination for distributed MIMO-systems based on wideband precoder selection","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104768S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757644,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick J\u00fcschke","affiliation":["RF Transceivers and Amplifiers, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"J\u00fcschke","id":"38016421900"},{"name":"Andreas Pascht","affiliation":["RF Transceivers and Amplifiers, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Pascht","id":"37278365500"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Friedrich Alexander University (LTE), Erlangen"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5943-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5940-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6757644","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757644","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Transceivers","Biological neural networks","Power amplifiers","Standards","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power supply circuits","radiofrequency power amplifiers","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","carbon footprint","mobile radio networks","bandwidth demand","network capacity","RF transceiver","frequency independent concept","energy efficiency optimization","RF power amplifiers","voltage controllable power supply","neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","RF Power Amplifier","Radio communication","Energy optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757644","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757644.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based efficiency optimization method for RF Power Amplifiers with controllable power supply","abstract":"Rising energy consumption and thus equipment operating cost as well as the parallel environmental need to reduce the carbon footprint is a very important issue in mobile radio networks. Beside the needs to reduce the energy consumption, the demand for bandwidth and network capacity is increasing and leading to more standards, frequency bands and applications. The RF transceiver, especially the Power Amplifier as a part of it, is one of the bottlenecks and setscrews for the requirements mentioned. The following paper presents a standard and frequency independent concept as well as a method for energy efficiency optimization of RF Power Amplifiers with voltage controllable power supply to adjust the operating point based on Neural Networks. The system is basically standard independent and can adapt itself to a certain standard with its requirements.

Sensitive applications such as medical, military, and financial ones rely on clouds' platform. Therefore, services continuity should be guaranteed as much as possible. However, services are sensitive to the network Quality of Service (QoS). Heavy network traffic may have its negative impact on services execution in a cloud environment. In extreme cases, cloud services may be completely interrupted due to many reasons including natural disasters - such as earthquakes and tornadoes - and human-induced disasters ranging from hackers to terrorists. In such circumstances, services should be automated without human intervention in order to minimize losses as much as possible. In this paper, the Partitioned Services Layer (PSL) architecture is proposed. It categorizes services into real-time and non realtime. Since real-time services are critical, they should not be subject to QoS. Therefore, they run on a Distributed Autonomous Control (DAC) environment in which devices are connected through a Local Area Network (LAN). On the other hand, non real-time services are executed in the cloud environment to reduce costs. Nevertheless, basic services are automated by another autonomous system which is based on case reasoning. Finally, the proposed architecture is analyzed and compared to other related work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioned services layer autonomous system for cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757668","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Partitioned services layer autonomous system for cloud computing","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757668/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147266","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioned services layer autonomous system for cloud computing","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051557S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6757674,"authors":[{"name":"Ugljesa Urosevic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Ugljesa","lastName":"Urosevic","id":"37704657600"},{"name":"Zoran Veljovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Veljovic","id":"37354092500"},{"name":"Milica Pejanovic-Djurisic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Pejanovic-Djurisic","id":"37370203200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5943-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5940-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6757674","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Relays","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","error statistics","mobile antennas","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance","bit error rate","mobile station","relay station","base station antenna","4th order diversity","cooperative relaying system","virtual orthogonal space time block coding","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","virtual OSTBC","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","Cooperative Relaying","OSTBC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a new scheme for performance improvements of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based simple cooperative relaying with virtual orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC).

The developed automatic modulation classification was trained using two training algorithms often used for supervised neural networks. The performance of the developed automatic modulation classification classifier was evaluated and compared using the two training algorithms. The overall performance evaluation of the classifier using the two training algorithms shows that the developed classifier could successfully classify the eight modulated schemes considered with an average success rate above 97.0% irrespective of the signal-to-noise value. The results of the study also show that training algorithms have an impact on the performance of an artificial neural network classifier.

The look-up table (LUT) digital adaptive predistortion (PD) approaches are effective for power amplifier (PA) linearization for reducing the PA power back-off and increasing the efficiency. Unlike other LUT predistorter based on uniform spacing of the LUT entries, the paper proposes a robust and behavioral method. The density of the table entries is directly proportional to the amplifier nonlinearity so the optimum table spacing could be realized. Besides, the proposed algorithm is able to optimize the LUT spacing without prior knowledge of the PA characteristics or input signal statistics and the LUT index calculation is made by a simple and fast algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Predistortion","Radio frequency","Baseband","Signal processing algorithms","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","statistical analysis","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LUT index calculation","input signal statistics","amplifier nonlinearity","behavioral method","LUT predistorter","PA power back-off","PA linearization technique","PD approach","modified complex gain predistorter","RF power amplifier","adaptive digital baseband predistortion technique","robust behavioral nonuniform look-up table spacing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF Power Amplifier","non-uniform Look-up Tables spacing","linearization","digital predistortion","Digital Signal Processor","dynamic optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757706","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust behavioral non uniform look-up table spacing in adaptive digital baseband predistortion technique for RF power amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust behavioral non uniform look-up table spacing in adaptive digital baseband predistortion technique for RF power amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757706/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757706/","accessionNumber":"14147299","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust behavioral non uniform look-up table spacing in adaptive digital baseband predistortion technique for RF power amplifier","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044593S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6757709,"authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Singh","affiliation":["GIS Cell, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Priyanka","lastName":"Singh","id":"38667393000"},{"name":"Suneeta Agarwal","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Suneeta","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37304443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5943-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5940-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6757709","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Robustness","Discrete cosine transforms","PSNR","Singular value decomposition","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","discrete cosine transforms","image watermarking","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid DCT- SVD-based robust watermarking scheme","copyright protection","discrete cosine transform","singular value decomposition","reference image","cover image","singular values","secret information","zig zag scrambling","gray scale watermarks","image processing attacks","normalized cross-correlation values","NCC values","watermarked image imperceptibility","peak signal-to-noise ratio values","PSNR values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT)","Reference Image","Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)","Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR)","Normalized Cross Correlation(NCC)"]}],"abstract":"A hybrid watermarking scheme exploiting the properties of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) has been proposed here.

Two different objective function formulations are assessed by PSO.

However, this scheme is sensitive to synchronization errors. Recently, some papers have investigated and reported the impact of carrier frequency offsets on this laudable scheme but without proffering any major solution to this major drawback. Hence, in this paper, an effective linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) based synchronization algorithm is employed to mitigate the effect of carrier frequency offset on the OFDM-IDMA scheme. This approach is highly efficient, as it does not increase the overhead and the complexity of the system. The bit error rate performance of the MMSE-based OFDM-IDMA system is therefore presented and analyzed. Simulation results show significant improvement in the overall performance of the system with the application of the MMSE-based synchronization algorithm. Also, the performances of MMSE-based OFDM-IDMA system in both slow and fast fading Rayleigh multipath channel scenarios are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Multipath channels","Interference","Receivers","Mobile communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast fading Rayleigh multipath channel scenario","bit error rate performance","carrier frequency offset","synchronization error","multiple access interference","mobile communication","interleave division multiple access","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM-IDMA systems","frequency synchronization algorithm","linear minimum mean-squared error algorithm","linear MMSE algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","IDMA","CFO","MMSE","synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757731","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757731.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear MMSE-based frequency synchronization algorithm for OFDM-IDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear MMSE-based frequency synchronization algorithm for OFDM-IDMA systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757731/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757731/","accessionNumber":"14147195","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear MMSE-based frequency synchronization algorithm for OFDM-IDMA systems","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062937S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6757733,"authors":[{"name":"N K Anish","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"N K","lastName":"Anish"},{"name":"B.

A packet scheduling algorithm is very crucial towards actualizing an effective utilization of the limited available resources in satellite LTE networks. Hence, the need for an effective packet scheduling algorithm cannot be overemphasized. The aim of this paper is to propose a new scheduling algorithm tagged QoS-Aware Fair (QAF) Scheduler that will provide a good trade-off among Quality of Service (QoS), fairness and throughput. The newly proposed scheduler is compared to existing ones through simulations and various performance indices have been used.

The advantage of this mode of conduction is that it feeds sinusoidal current with near to unity power factor into the grid. Due to the versatility of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), it offers significant advantages in high performance and low volume applications. The level of optimization in FPGAs is very high in comparison to microprocessors or Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) as FPGAs allow customizable bit-widths and massive instruction-level parallelism.

Therefore, using nonlinear techniques to design AVR would seem more appropriate.

This paper proposes a system model which uses Adaptive Multiresolution Modulation (AMM) of 16, 64 and 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) along with Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes of different code rates as a Forward Error Correcting (FEC) code to provide UEP for the heterogeneous traffic and also for maintaining the (QOS) of the different services at the desired level. Comparing with previous works, the difference with the proposed system is that channel coding is accounted while determining the shape of QAM at which the system performs best. Also, a multiresolution modulation is designed which does not degrade the performance of the least important message as that of the most important one is increased. A BER performance gain of 36.6 dB arises for the high priority message with the proposed scheme when compared to a fixed modulation scheme with the same coding used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC coded adaptive multiresolution modulation for Unequal Error Protection","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757766","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757766.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"LDPC coded adaptive multiresolution modulation for Unequal Error Protection","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757766/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147347","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC coded adaptive multiresolution modulation for Unequal Error Protection","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069947S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6757775,"authors":[{"name":"Kian Jazayeri","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kian","lastName":"Jazayeri","id":"37086648785"},{"name":"Sener Uysal","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sener","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37301304100"},{"name":"Moein Jazayeri","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta, Turkey"],"firstName":"Moein","lastName":"Jazayeri","id":"37086650039"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5943-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5940-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6757775","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Power generation","Power measurement","Training","Fault detection","Azimuth","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","losses","neural nets","power engineering computing","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power losses determination","artificial neural network","intelligent system","solar panel fault detection system","power estimations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural networks","fault detection","photovoltaic cells","photovoltaic systems","solar energy","solar power generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757775","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757775.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of power losses in solar panels using artificial neural network","abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is on developing an intelligent system which provides real time monitoring and fault detection for solar panels.

Unfortunately, utilizing short pulses decreases the average transmitted power, which can hinder the radar's normal modes of operation, particularly for multi-function and surveillance radars. Since the average transmitted power is directly linked to the receiver SNR, it is often desirable to increase the pulse width while simultaneously maintaining adequate range resolution. This can be made possible by using pulse compression techniques. Pulse compression allows us to achieve the average transmitted power of a relatively long pulse, while obtaining the range resolution corresponding to a short pulse. In this paper, we shall implement (LFM) linear frequency modulation digital pulse compression technique using (FPGA) which has distinct advantages compared to other application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for the purposes of this work. The FPGA provides flexibility, for example, full reconfiguration in milli-seconds and permits a complete single chip solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and realization of an efficient VLIC architecture for a linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse compression in pulsed radars using FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Radar","Mathematical model","Signal resolution","PROM","Receivers","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","pulse compression","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLIC architecture","linear frequency modulation pulse compression","pulsed radars","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","range resolution","multifunction radars","surveillance radars","application specific integrated circuits","ASIC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Linear frequency modulation","Digital pulse compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design and realization of an efficient VLIC architecture for a linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse compression in pulsed radars using FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14147234","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and realization of an efficient VLIC architecture for a linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse compression in pulsed radars using FPGA","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060535S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6757786,"authors":[{"name":"Insah Bhurtah","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Mauritius, Mauritius"],"firstName":"Insah","lastName":"Bhurtah","id":"37085459981"},{"name":"Pierre Clarel Catherine","affiliation":["Industrial Systems Engineering, University of Technology, Mauritius"],"firstName":"Pierre Clarel","lastName":"Catherine","id":"37333178800"},{"name":"K M Sunjiv Soyjaudah","affiliation":["University of Mauritius, Reduit, Moka, MU"],"firstName":"K M Sunjiv","lastName":"Soyjaudah","id":"38546500400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5943-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5940-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6757786","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Systematics","Convolutional codes","Educational institutions","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","interleaved codes","iterative methods","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel concatenation","recursive systematic convolutional codes","interleaved set","turbo codes","soft-in soft-out decoder","SISO decoder","maximum a-posteriori algorithm","MAP algorithm","channel metric","conventional decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757786","abstract":"In this work, a scheme for the parallel concatenation of convolutional codes is proposed. The systematic and interleaved sets are encoded. Unlike conventional turbo codes, however, both encoded sequences are concatenated and transmitted. At the receiving side, the first half of the corrupted sequence (corresponding to its encoded counterpart at the transmission side) is used as input to a soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder. The second half is, in a similar manner, used by a second SISO decoder. These two decoders then use the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) algorithm for decoding. The key difference, however, with conventional turbo schemes, is that the channel metric is not removed when computing the extrinsic information for the first iteration. This is made possible since both decoders have access to an independently corrupted set. In the sequel, there is almost no gap in the performance with increased signal to noise ratio. In addition, for the remaining iterations, the proposed scheme employs conventional decoding and makes use of an inherent stopping criterion that enables the decoding procedure to be stopped once both decoders converge to the same sequence. Thus, the system makes an efficient use of iterations while reducing the computing resources required for decoding.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757786","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Africon","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746871/6757586/06757786.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Africon","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel concatenation of recursive systematic convolutional codes with transmission of interleaved set","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Parallel concatenation of recursive systematic convolutional codes with transmission of interleaved set","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757786/","accessionNumber":"14147078","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757786/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel concatenation of recursive systematic convolutional codes with transmission of interleaved set","confLoc":"Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"africon2013submission416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049423S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746871","isNumber":"6757586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746871","xplore-issue":"6757586","articleId":"6757786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6757791,"authors":[{"name":"Beneyam B.

The fast expanding densely-populated informal settlements are among the key areas that could benefit from this new technology. This paper presents a simulation study on the spectral efficiency gains that are achievable with CoMP transmission in an exemplary dense informal settlement area. The results demonstrate that use of CoMP provides capacity enhancements without need for costly deployment of additional macro sites, thus contributing to affordability of broadband access through reduced cost-per-bit.

In CR, an unlicensed network user (secondary user) is enabled to dynamically/adaptively access the frequency channels considering the current state of the external radio environment. In this article, we investigate the medium access control protocol identification for applications in cognitive MAC. MAC protocol identification enables CR users to sense and identify the MAC protocol types of any existing transmissions (primary or secondary users). The identification results will be used by CR users to adaptively change their transmission parameters in order to improve spectrum utilization, as well as to minimize potential interference to primary and other secondary users. MAC protocol identification also facilitates the implementation of communications among heterogeneous CR networks. In this article, we consider four MAC protocols, including TDMA, CSMA/CA, pure ALOHA, and slotted ALOHA, and propose a MAC identification method based on machine learning techniques.

To facilitate these paradigms, considerable research has shown promise of the cognitive radio (CR) technology, particularly the cognitive radio resource management (CRRM) on the top of resource allocation to control Layer-1 and Layer-2 radio operations, thus eliminating the concerns of potential system impacts and operation unreliability to bridge the gap between cellular and CR technologies. To support diverse communication paradigms with different challenges, a variety of CRRM schemes have been recently proposed, which however significantly perplexes the system implementation. To provide a general reconfigurable framework, in this article, we reveal a software-defined design of the CRRM. Through proper configurations, this software- defined design is able to adapt to diverse communication paradigms in LTE-A/LTE-B, and provides transmission reliability in terms of quality- of-service guarantees via the optimum control of the design. Supporting diverse CRRM schemes, this design substantially simplifies the system realization to bring the development of the CRRM to the next stage of practice for the fifth generation (5G) cellular network.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2014.6757899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6757884/06757899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2014.6757899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757884","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio resource management for future cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio resource management for future cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14144637","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6757899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio resource management for future cellular networks","sourcePdf":"015LIEN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057074S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6757884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6757884","articleId":"6757899","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6757900,"authors":[{"name":"Dongheon Lee","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"bio":{"p":["Dongheon Lee (lidx10@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) received his B.

This implies a statistically uniform distribution of traffic load over space, but in reality the spatial traffic distribution is highly non-uniform across different cells, which calls for actual spatial traffic models. In this article, we first present the analysis of traffic measurements collected from commercial cellular networks in China, and demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the traffic density (the traffic load per unit area) can be approximated by the log-normal or Weibull distribution depending on time and space. Then we propose a spatial traffic model which generates large-scale spatial traffic variations by a sum of sinusoids that captures the characteristics of log-normally distributed and spatially correlated cellular traffic. The proposed model can be directly used to generate realistic spatial traffic patterns for cellular network simulations, such as performance evaluations of network planning and load balancing.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2014.6757900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6757884/06757900.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2014.6757900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modeling of the traffic density in cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757900/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modeling of the traffic density in cellular networks","volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14144634","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6757900/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modeling of the traffic density in cellular networks","sourcePdf":"016LEE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085313S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6757884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6757884","articleId":"6757900","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6757901,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Han","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Han [s'8] (th36@njit.edu) received B.E. in Electrical Engineering and M.E. in Computer Engineering from Dalian University of Technology and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, respectively.

The SU packets or connections are treated as customers and the primary user (PU) channel as the server. And the emergence of PU causes the licensed channel temporarily unavailable for SUs. The action is like an interruption to the server. Each secondary customer wanting to optimize its benefit needs to make a choice between entering the spectrum and balking. In our model, we consider an infrastructure-based CRN where SUs can get the information on the number of SUs in the queue and the spectrum state before entering. A pure threshold strategy is adopted to maximize the individual welfare. If the number of SUs waiting in the queue does not exceed the threshold, the tagged SU joins the queue; otherwise leaves. We also investigate the corresponding social benefit when all SUs obey the threshold strategy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2013.6757976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757902","startPage":"328","endPage":"332","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747517/6757902/06757976.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equilibrium threshold strategy in observable queueing systems in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6757976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6757976/","displayDocTitle":"Equilibrium threshold strategy in observable queueing systems in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14156674","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"01","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equilibrium threshold strategy in observable queueing systems in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1A126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086143S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747517","isNumber":"6757902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747517","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6757902","articleId":"6757976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6758005,"authors":[{"name":"Li Hao","affiliation":["Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Hao","id":"37086649031"},{"name":"Chen Zhiyong","affiliation":["Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Zhiyong","id":"37530745900"},{"name":"Zhang Ruixue","affiliation":["Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Ruixue","id":"37860330100"},{"name":"Dong Yonggui","affiliation":["Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Yonggui","id":"37682783400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1390-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6758005","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitors","Energy storage","Noise","Analog circuits","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","blind source separation","independent component analysis","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","interfering signals","analog circuits","instantaneous linear mixing model","independent component analysis algorithm","energy storage circuit elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind source separation","independent component analysis","electromagnetic compatibility","interfering signals","analog circuits"]}],"abstract":"A blind source separation method is proposed to identify source interfering signals at analog circuits nodes.

Simulation results show that the combined algorithm outperforms the DSLM method by 2.2dB when the number of subcarriers is 256 and the value of CCDF is 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2013.6758053","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747517/6757902/06758053.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2013.6758053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSLM-companding algorithm for reducing the PAPR of OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758053/","displayDocTitle":"MSLM-companding algorithm for reducing the PAPR of OFDM system","volume":"01","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14156578","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758053/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSLM-companding algorithm for reducing the PAPR of OFDM system","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"2D024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061064S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747517","isNumber":"6757902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747517","xplore-issue":"6757902","articleId":"6758053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6758055,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ling","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Li Ling","id":"37085659413"},{"name":"Ma Xiaozhen","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Ma Xiaozhen","id":"37086658659"},{"name":"Huang Yulan","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Huang Yulan","id":"37086685827"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1390-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6758055","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic mail","Cloud computing","Servers","Browsers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDN cloud","cloud computing","video business","network traffic","quality of service improvement","Web sites","content delivery network technology","CDN technology","video browsing","IT infrastructure","cloud datacenter","network congestion","load balancing mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDN","cloud computing","CDN cloud"]}],"abstract":"Along with the development of the network, video business has become the mainstream of the network traffic gradually. In order to improve the quality of service, many websites use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) technology to accelerate the video browsing. At the same time, cloud computing is becoming more and more popular because it can process massive data and has high scalability. In recent years, cloud computing has been applied in various fields. Both of the techniques are very promising, but they have their own drawbacks respectively: CDN is faced with lack of the IT infrastructure and insufficient storage space due to the growth of users; cloud computing's resources is highly concentrated in the cloud datacenter, so network congestion at cloud egress and latency to user become a neglected problem. This paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these two technologies, and then puts forward a scheme combining CDN and cloud computing - CDN cloud. Further problems need to be concerned for CDN cloud are discussed in detail. The new system can be better applied in the video business and other applications which have high traffic. Its high scalability and load balancing mechanism make it more suitable for the development of the network. CDN cloud has a wider application prospect, and this kind of fusion is the necessary direction of future network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDN cloud: A novel scheme for combining CDN and cloud computing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2013.6758055","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747517/6757902/06758055.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2013.6758055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"CDN cloud: A novel scheme for combining CDN and cloud computing","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/6758055/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14156707","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDN cloud: A novel scheme for combining CDN and cloud computing","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"2D026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062317S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747517","isNumber":"6757902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747517","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6757902","articleId":"6758055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6758071,"authors":[{"name":"Imam Sutrisno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Shipbuilding Institute of Polytechnic, Surabaya, Japan"],"firstName":"Imam","lastName":"Sutrisno","id":"38488884300"},{"name":"Mohammad Abu Jami'in","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Shipbuilding Institute of Polytechnic, Surabaya, Japan"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abu","lastName":"Jami'in","id":"37085368235"},{"name":"Jinglu Hu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Shipbuilding Institute of Polytechnic, Surabaya, Japan"],"lastName":"Jinglu Hu","id":"37278204200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1390-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6758071","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758071","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Predictive models","Neural networks","Lyapunov methods","Adaptation models","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","learning systems","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov learning algorithm","fuzzy switching adaptive controller","nonlinear system","quasilinear ARX neural network","stability proof","Lyapunov approach","multiinput multioutput neural network","linear controller","nonlinear controller","core-part submodel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov Learning Algorithm","Fuzzy Switching Adaptive Controller","Quasi-ARX Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MIC.2013.6758071","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747517/6757902/06758071.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","startPage":"762","endPage":"766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2013.6758071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Lyapunov learning algorithm for fuzzy switching adaptive controller modeled under Quasi-ARX Neural Network","abstract":"This paper presents a fuzzy adaptive controller applied to a non linear system modeled under a Quasi-linear ARX Neural Network, with stability proof by using the Lyapunov approach.

The structure has change to complicated new model with distributed generations from traditional open network. The voltage and power losses of traditional network will be influenced by the location connected with DG, reactive power, active power and the number of DG. The purpose to connect DG is to improve reliability of the system, reduce the loss of network and reduce the cost. In order to achieve this goal, this paper analyzes the indicator of power loss and takes it as objective function. Considering the superior properties of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in solving discrete values problem, we use the improved PSO algorithm (the algorithm is improved by the Tabu Search mechanism) to study the problems which include the positions, capacity and numbers of DGs.

To solve an increasing interest in forecasting accuracy of wind speed, this paper proposes a new method to improve wind speed prediction accuracy based on different grey models and the genetic neural network. The prediction of wind speed is achieved in two stages. In the first stage, wind speed is predicted by using the different grey models. In the second stage, wind forecasting models is established based on the genetic algorithm neural network (GANN), which of input data based on the results using the different grey prediction models. The weights and thresholds of the neural network are adjusted based on the genetic algorithm. The proposed model is verified by using actual wind speed data, and is compared different grey prediction models in terms of the mean absolute error and the mean relative error. It is concluded that the new model is of high precision. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives better performance.","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2013.6758238","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1482","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2013.6758238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758076","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 2nd International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747517/6758076/06758238.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind speed forecasting based on grey predictor and genetic neural network models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758238/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wind speed forecasting based on grey predictor and genetic neural network models","isConference":true,"volume":"02","htmlLink":"/document/6758238/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14156495","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind speed forecasting based on grey predictor and genetic neural network models","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"50266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052648S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747517","isNumber":"6758076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747517","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6758076","articleId":"6758238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6758342,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The PRMS antenna consists of a planar MS placed atop of and in direct contact with a planar slot antenna, both having a circular shape with a diameter of 78 mm (0.9 \u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n), making it compact and low profile. By rotating the MS around the center with respect to the slot antenna, the PRMS antenna can be reconfigured to linear polarization, left-hand and right-hand circular polarizations. An equivalent circuit is used to explain the reconfigurability of the antenna. The PRMS antenna is studied and designed to operate at around 3.5 GHz using computer simulation. For verification of simulation results, the PRMS antenna is fabricated and measured. The antenna performance, in terms of polarization reconfigurability, axial-ratio bandwidth, impedance bandwidth, realized boresight gain and radiation pattern, is presented. Results show that the PRMS antenna in circular polarizations achieves an operating bandwidth of 3.3-3.7 GHz (i.e., fractional bandwidth 11.4%), a boresight gain of above 5 dBi and high-polarization isolation of larger than 15 dB. While the PRMS antenna in linear polarization achieves a gain of above 7.5 dBi with cross-polarization isolation larger than 50 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2310209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6823189/06758342.pdf","startPage":"2891","endPage":"2898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2310209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna Using Metasurface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758342/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna Using Metasurface","volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349290","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758342/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna Using Metasurface","sourcePdf":"tap-zhu-2310209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052301S","chronDate":"June  2014","isNumber":"6823189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"189","articleId":"6758342","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6758346,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Li","affiliation":["ZTE USA Inc., Morristown, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"38062884800"},{"name":"Xinying Li","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinying","lastName":"Li","id":"37406889700"},{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292791300"},{"name":"Y.

In this scheme, we use our specially designed electronic controlled liquid tunable optical filter to simultaneously select downstream signals and process upstream signal chirp. By experiment, we demonstrate this bidirectional transmission system and achieve error-free transmission performance over different fiber distances. A power budget of 35.6 dB for 25-km fiber transmission is obtained to support 1 : 512 splitting ratios. Through 100-km fiber transmission, a 34.4-dB optical power budget with a nonrepeater is also achieved. Moreover, the effects of various system parameters such as filter profile and downstream signals' launched power, are also investigated in detail by simulation and experiment for improving system

tools to evaluate the performance of new concepts in mobile communications. However, there is a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy. In this paper, we extend the popular Wireless World Initiative for New Radio (WINNER) channel model with new features to make it as realistic as possible. Our approach enables more realistic evaluation results at an early stage of algorithm development. The new model supports 3-D propagation, 3-D antenna patterns, time evolving channel traces of arbitrary length, scenario transitions and variable terminal speeds. We validated the model by measurements in a coherent LTE advanced testbed in downtown Berlin, Germany. We then reproduced the same scenario in the model and compared several channel parameters (delay spread, path gain, K-factor, geometry factor and capacity). The results match very well and we can accurately predict the performance for an urban macro-cell setup with commercial high-gain antennas. At the same time, the computational complexity does not increase significantly and we can use all existing WINNER parameter tables. These artificial channels, having equivalent characteristics as measured data, enable virtual field trials long before prototypes are available.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2310220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2310220","startPage":"3242","endPage":"3256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6823189/06758357.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QuaDRiGa: A 3-D Multi-Cell Channel Model With Time Evolution for Enabling Virtual Field Trials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"QuaDRiGa: A 3-D Multi-Cell Channel Model With Time Evolution for Enabling Virtual Field Trials","volume":"62","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14349289","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6758357/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"QuaDRiGa: A 3-D Multi-Cell Channel Model With Time Evolution for Enabling Virtual Field Trials","sourcePdf":"tap-jaeckel-2310220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045672S","chronDate":"June  2014","isNumber":"6823189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"273","articleId":"6758357","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6758365,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Prior","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, FCUP, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6800037/6758365/6758365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Prior (s'06\u2013M'07) received the Lic. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, Portugal, in 1997 and 2001, respectively, and a Ph.D. in computer science from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto in 2007.

Our systematic mechanism maintains the sparse structure during the recombination of packets at the intermediate nodes. The performance of our protocol is compared by means of simulations of IEEE reference grids against standard master-slave protocols used in real systems. Our results show that network coding achieves 100% reliability, even for hostile network conditions, while gathering data 10 times faster than standard master-slave schemes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2288868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800037","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6800037/06758365.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding Protocols for Smart Grid Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6758365/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network Coding Protocols for Smart Grid Communications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239028","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding Protocols for Smart Grid Communications","sourcePdf":"tsg-nistor-2288868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107118S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6800037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6800037","articleId":"6758365","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6758369,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Sharma","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani\u2014Goa Campus, Zuarinagar, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7482862/6758369/sharm-2308438-small.gif","p":["\nNitin Sharma is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Birla \nInstitute of Technology and Science Pilani\u2014Goa Campus, Zuarinagar, India, where his research dissertation is on \nwireless communication.","He is a Lecturer with the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Electronics and Instrumentation, \nBirla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani\u2014Goa Campus.

However, such deployment is exigent due to the presence of inter- and intratier interference and the ad hoc operation of femtocells. Motivated by the flexible subchannel allocation capability of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access, in this paper, we consider the problem of joint subchannel and power allocation in both the uplink and downlink of a two-tier orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based femtocell network. It is a multiobjective optimization problem that aims to maximize the throughput of all users, simultaneously increasing the power efficiency of femtocell base stations. Interference to macrocell users is kept below a certain tolerable threshold. The minimum-rate requirements of delay-sensitive users are also taken into consideration. The problem is solved using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version II, and the results are compared with the existing solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Subchannel and Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Two-Tier OFDMA Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2308438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7482862/06758369.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2308438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7482862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Subchannel and Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Two-Tier OFDMA Femtocell Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6758369/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16035001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Subchannel and Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Two-Tier OFDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-anpalagan-2308438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094415S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7482862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7482862","articleId":"6758369","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6758371,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Choudhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6868320/6758371/choud-2310140-small.gif","p":["Abhijit Choudhury (S'11) received the B.E. degree from the National Institute of Technology, Agartala, India, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Bombay, Bombay, India, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

An advanced control strategy for balancing the two dc-link capacitors is also proposed. In this paper, the main focus is on the total voltage harmonic distortion (%THDv), the analytical derivation of the three-level capacitor currents, and the voltage balancing of two capacitor voltages. For generating the gate signals, space vector pulse width modulation (SV-PWM) is used. The developed voltage-balancing scheme helps to reduce the number of converter switching sequences, compared with the conventional SV-PWM strategy, and keeps the voltage difference between the two dc-link capacitors at the desired voltage level. The developed test-bench is used for a permanent magnet synchronous machine drive for electric vehicle (EV) applications. Detailed simulation studies are performed using MATLAB/Simulink block set and experimental verification is achieved using dSpace based real-time simulator. Both the simulation and experimental results show a significant improvement in reduction of total harmonic distortion (%THDv) for the three-level inverter.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2310140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2310140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868320","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6868320/06758371.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Inverters","Capacitors","Switches","Switching frequency","Switching loss","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor switching","electric vehicles","harmonic distortion","invertors","permanent magnet motors","pulse width modulation","switching convertors","synchronous motor drives","traction power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative analysis","two-level DC inverter","two-level AC inverter","three-level DC inverter","three-level AC inverter","electric vehicle traction inverter","DC-link voltage balancing algorithm","advanced control strategy","DC-link capacitor balancing","total voltage harmonic distortion","THDv reduction","three-level capacitor current analytical derivation","gate signal generation","space vector pulse width modulation","SV-PWM","converter switching sequence reduction","permanent magnet synchronous machine drive","EV application","Matlab block set","dSpace based real-time simulator","Simulink block set"]},{"kwd":["Electric vehicles (EVs)","inverters","motor drives","permanent magnet motors","propulsion","traction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis Between Two-Level and Three-Level DC/AC Electric Vehicle Traction Inverters Using a Novel DC-Link Voltage Balancing Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758371/","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6758371/","accessionNumber":"14485742","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Hydro-Quebec"},{"fundingName":"Connect Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis Between Two-Level and Three-Level DC/AC Electric Vehicle Traction Inverters Using a Novel DC-Link Voltage Balancing Algorithm","sourcePdf":"jestpe-williamson-2310140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075253S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6868320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6868320","articleId":"6758371","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6758377,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6936410/6758377/wang-2307067-small.gif","p":["Jing Wang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","She is a Visiting Research Student with the Learning and Vision Research Group, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

However, SRC emphasizes the sparsity too much and overlooks the correlation information which has been demonstrated to be critical in real-world face recognition problems. Besides, some paper considers the correlation but overlooks the discriminative ability of sparsity. Different from these existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a framework called adaptive sparse representation-based classification (ASRC) in which sparsity and correlation are jointly considered.

NSCT is very efficient in representing the directional information and capturing intrinsic geometrical structures of the objects. It has characteristics of high resolution, shift-invariance, and high directionality. In the proposed methods, a given number of decomposition levels are used for multispectral (MS) images while a higher number of decomposition levels are used for Pan images relatively to the ratio of the Pan pixel size to the MS pixel size. This preserves both spectral and spatial qualities while decreasing computation time. Moreover, upsampling of MS images is performed after NSCT and not before. By applying upsampling after NSCT, structures and detail information of the MS images are more likely to be preserved and thus stay more distinguishable. Hence, we propose to exploit this property in pan-sharpening by fusing it with detail information provided by the Pan image at the same fine level. The proposed methods are tested on WorldView-2 datasets and compared with the standard pan-sharpening technique. Visual and quantitative results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Both spectral and spatial qualities have been improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pan-Sharpening Based on the Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform: Application to Worldview-2 Imagery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2306332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6834838/06758378.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2306332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6834838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Pan-Sharpening Based on the Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform: Application to Worldview-2 Imagery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6758378/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14379590","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pan-Sharpening Based on the Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform: Application to Worldview-2 Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-chikrelmezouar-2306332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112013S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6834838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6834838","articleId":"6758378","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6758380,"authors":[{"name":"Tadao Nagatsuma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadao","lastName":"Nagatsuma","id":"37271290400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"6758380","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1933},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Photonics-based RF transmitter converting optical subcarriers to terahertz carriers by photodiodes.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"76KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/6750774/6758380/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2309643.gif","coverImage":""},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Photonics","Optical transmitters","Bandwidth","Modulation","Detectors","Photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication","signal detection","terahertz wave detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terahertz waves","broadband communications","signal generation","signal modulation","signal detection","fiber-optic networks","wireless networks","THz wireless communications","telecom-based photonics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communication","photonics","photodiode","millimeter wave","terahertz"]}],"abstract":"There has been an increasing interest in the application of terahertz (THz) waves to broadband wireless communications.

We show how the use of the interferometric coherence information can help to detect more precisely the areas affected by the flood, reducing false alarms and missed identifications which affect algorithms based on SAR intensity alone. The effectiveness of using the additional InSAR information layer is illustrated by RGB composites of various combinations of intensity and coherence data. Analysis of multitemporal SAR intensity and coherence trends reveals complex behavior of various field types, which we interpret through a Bayesian inference approach, based on a manual identification of representative scattering and coherence signatures of selected homogeneous fields. The approach allows to integrate external, ancillary information to derive a posteriori probabilistic maps of flood inundation accounting for different scattering responses to the presence of water. First results of this semiautomated methodology, using simple assumptions for the SAR signatures and a priori information based on the distance from river courses, show encouraging results, and open a path to improvement through use of more complex hydrologic and topo-hydrographic information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6758381/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14560745","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SAR and InSAR for Flood Monitoring: Examples With COSMO-SkyMed Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR and InSAR for Flood Monitoring: Examples With COSMO-SkyMed Data","sourcePdf":"jstars-refice-2305165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087736S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6881766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6881766","articleId":"6758381","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6758385,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin S.

Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time. There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we present a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic setting. We fit the model in a near-optimal manner using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) augmented with a local search. We demonstrate that the EKF-based algorithm performs competitively with a state-of-the-art algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling but is significantly less computationally demanding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodels for Time-Evolving Social Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2310294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6856242/06758385.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2310294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6856242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodels for Time-Evolving Social Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6758385/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450751","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-12-1-0443"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodels for Time-Evolving Social Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-xu-2310294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080943S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6856242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6856242","articleId":"6758385","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6758391,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppina Monti","affiliation":["Department of Engineering for Innovation, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6819883/6758391/monti-2310235-small.gif","p":["Giuseppina Monti received the Laurea (Hons.) degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Salento, Lecce, Italy, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","She is currently with the Department of Innovation Engineering, University of Salento, as a Temporary Researcher and Lecturer in CAD of microwave circuits and antennas.

The proposed solution consists of two parts. Firstly, dual decomposition is applied to transform the original coupled-constraint game into a decoupled one. Then, Nash equilibrium of the decoupled game is proven to be achievable via best response, which is computed by gradient projection. The proposed solution is also extended to an online version, which is able to alleviate the impact of the price prediction error. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively shift the peak-hour demand to off-peak hours, enhance the welfare of each user, and minimize the peak-to-average ratio. The scalability of the approach and the impact of the user number are also investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6758401/","accessionNumber":"14239038","displayDocTitle":"Residential Energy Consumption Scheduling: A Coupled-Constraint Game Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residential Energy Consumption Scheduling: A Coupled-Constraint Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tsg-yang-2287494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091768S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6800037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6800037","articleId":"6758401","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6758405,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Wall","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6861487/6758405/6758405-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Wall received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering, the M.Sc. degree in power systems, and the Ph.D. degree in power systems from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 2008, 2009, and 2013, respectively.","His main interests are power system dynamics, frequency stability, and intelligent controlled islanding.

This paper proposes an online algorithm for estimating the time of disturbance and inertia after a disturbance. This is in contrast to previous inertia estimation methods that operated offline. The algorithm processes wide-area measurements of frequency and active power and could provide support for adaptive frequency control. Simulations, laboratory tests, and real transmission system measurements have been used to demonstrate the algorithm's ability to correctly detect a disturbance, accurately estimate the time of the disturbance and the inertia, and prevent false disturbance detections.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6861487/06758405.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2306062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2306062","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Estimation of the Time of Disturbance and Inertia in Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758405/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Estimation of the Time of Disturbance and Inertia in Power Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758405/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14469338","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Estimation of the Time of Disturbance and Inertia in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-wall-2306062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091514S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6861487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6861487","articleId":"6758405","onlineDate":"06 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6758499,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Zorba","affiliation":["Qatar Mobility Innovations Center (QMIC), Al-Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Zorba","id":"38310931600"},{"name":"Hossam S.

Several mechanisms have been proposed over the last years to mitigate the interference problem, where Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) outstands as one of the best approaches to tackle the interference in cellular systems. The main disadvantage of CoMP is the need of high signalling over the system in order to exchange information among the different parties involved in the communication process (eNBs and UEs), that questions its practical benefit for the operators. This paper presents a novel beamforming mechanism that needs for very low signalling among the transmitting base stations, it is a low complexity transmission strategy, the amount of interference to cell edge users is controlled and it offers an outstanding performance. Computer simulations show the data rate enhancement of the proposed CoMP mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758499/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14157360","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758499/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Grassmannian beamforming for Coordinated Multipoint transmission in multicell systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grassmannian beamforming for Coordinated Multipoint transmission in multicell systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p65zorba.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046024S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746241","isNumber":"6758464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746241","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6758464","articleId":"6758499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6758515,"authors":[{"name":"Ismehene Chahbi","affiliation":["HANA Research Group, University of Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ismehene","lastName":"Chahbi","id":"37671002500"},{"name":"Dorra Ben Amara","affiliation":["HANA Research Group, University of Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Dorra","lastName":"Ben Amara","id":"37086645906"},{"name":"Abdelfettah Belghith","affiliation":["HANA Research Group, University of Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelfettah","lastName":"Belghith","id":"37322609000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6758515","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Roads","Array signal processing","Omnidirectional antennas","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","omnidirectional antennas","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network routing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel route guidance algorithm","beamforming techniques","vehicular networks","car drivers","optimal selection","VANETS","MVDR beamforming technique","radio interference","wireless networks","omnidirectionnal antennas","shortest path algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["route guidance system","MVDR beamforming","vehicular networks"]}],"abstract":"Route guidance systems become indispensable for car drivers because of its great convenience.

This study employs Behavior Trees (BTs) for formal verification of mobile agent based anomaly detection system in WSNs. We employed BT based formal semantics to integrate the behavior projection of different components of anomaly detection system. The Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL) tool is used to formally specify the behavior tree model.

Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations. Gaps hampering direct code generation from graphical models are identified and closed by proposing an initial conceptualization of a domain-specific modeling language.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

However, existing Flickr trajectory data mining research has not considered mining frequent trajectory patterns whilst also considering the temporal domain. Therefore, a significant opportunity exists to demonstrate the application of a pattern mining algorithm to a large geo-tagged photo dataset. Thus, we present a novel application of the trajectory pattern mining algorithm to a 2012 Flickr dataset of Australia and encompassing state, Queens land. In our experiments we show that many interesting, previously unknown patterns discovered through our framework. Our framework is able to discover expected major landmarks such as cities and tourist attractions. In addition, we make the notable discover of what is theorized to be valuable tourist travel information about sequential movements between hot-spot attractions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6758785/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14179143","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Mining Frequent Trajectory Patterns and Regions-of-Interest from Flickr Photos","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining Frequent Trajectory Patterns and Regions-of-Interest from Flickr Photos","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504b454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05731S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6758785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6758893,"authors":[{"name":"Anupam A.

The proposed model is critically assessed with the ramp product which is currently under consideration by several system operators. We conduct theoretical assessment based on a proposed lack-of-ramp probability (LORP) index and numerical assessment using Monte Carlo simulations.

We propose a stochastic optimal power flow (OPF) formulation that handles uncertain energy from wind and uncertain reserves provided by DR. To handle the uncertainty, we formulate chance constraints and use a scenario based methodology to solve the stochastic OPF problem. This technique allows us to provide a-priori guarantees regarding the probability of constraint satisfaction. Additionally, we devise a strategy for the reserves, provided either by the generators or the loads, that could be deployed in real time operation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology, we carry out a simulation based analysis on the IEEE 30-bus network. Our case studies show that optimizing over the reserves provided by DR, even though they are uncertain, results in lower total cost compared to the case where only generation side reserves are taken into account. We also carry out a Monte Carlo analysis to empirically estimate the probability of constraint satisfaction and demonstrate that it is within the theoretical limits.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.296","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06758894.pdf","startPage":"2353","endPage":"2362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Optimal Power Flow with Uncertain Reserves from Demand Response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Optimal Power Flow with Uncertain Reserves from Demand Response","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758894/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14179291","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Optimal Power Flow with Uncertain Reserves from Demand Response","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504c353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073991S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6758894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":6758914,"authors":[{"name":"Logan Rakai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Logan","lastName":"Rakai","id":"37294955400"},{"name":"William Rosehart","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Rosehart","id":"37282835200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2504-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6758914","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":918},"abstract":"The optimal power flow problem (OPF) has been of importance to power system operators for many decades. Being able to quickly determine optimal operating points and analyzing larger networks can lead to advantages for operators from reliability, stability, cost and market fairness perspectives. This work aims at achieving those ends by solving OPF problems by utilizing hardware acceleration capabilities of graphical processing units (GPUs). At present, nearly all desktop and laptop computers ship with general-purpose GPUs that can be harnessed to accelerate analysis. This work will present important concepts regarding effective use of GPUs as it pertains to OPF problems and illustrate the types of problems that stand to benefit most from their use. The benefits of GPU acceleration are demonstrated by implementing a predictor-corrector interior-point method with the majority of the computation offloaded onto a GPU. Experiments are used to validate the developments by analyzing well-known power systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06758914.pdf","startPage":"2511","endPage":"2516","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Solutions to Optimal Power Flow Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","MATLAB","Load flow","Vectors","Computer architecture","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","load flow","power system analysis computing","predictor-corrector methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis","predictor-corrector interior-point method","general-purpose GPU","graphical processing units","hardware acceleration capabilities","OPF problems","power system operators","optimal power flow problems","GPU-accelerated solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","Optimal Power Flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6758914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Solutions to Optimal Power Flow Problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6758914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14158874","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated Solutions to Optimal Power Flow Problems","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504c511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052309S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6758914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6758998,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Z.Y.

To fill that gap and better understand information privacy concerns among different communities, this study draws upon theories of perceptual control and familiarity to identify the antecedents of information privacy concerns related to location-based service and user literacy.

IT managers are incorporating cloud-based IT services as replacements and/or as enhancements for existing on-site solutions. This strategy leads to the concept of a federated business application, which consists of a variety of on-site and cloud-based subparts, dynamically orchestrated to a single solution. In this setting, the selection of appropriate IT services is critical. Following the discussions of environmental thinking in IT aspects like Green IT and Green IS, the issue of appropriate IT service depends on not only functionality and costs, but additionally also on the environmental impact of the service selection. To address this issue, this paper presents a service selection model for cloud-based services with a focus on the environmental aspects of the selection process. This is done by modeling a multi-criteria decision model based on the rational choice theory. The proposed model provides a selection process which leads to maximal service functionality coverage with minimal environmental impact for a given service provider setting. The application of the model is illustrated in a typical industry case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06759121.pdf","startPage":"4200","endPage":"4209","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Greening the Service Selection in Cloud Computing: The Case of Federated ERP Solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green products","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Companies","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","enterprise resource planning","green computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","federated ERP solutions","industrial acceptance","cloud-based IT services","complex business applications","federated business application","cloud-based subparts","environmental thinking","IT aspects","green IT","green IS","service selection model","selection process","multicriteria decision model modeling","rational choice theory","maximal service functionality coverage","minimal environmental impact"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Green IS","Service Selection","Federated ERP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Greening the Service Selection in Cloud Computing: The Case of Federated ERP Solutions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759121/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14179123","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Greening the Service Selection in Cloud Computing: The Case of Federated ERP Solutions","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504e200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150638S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6759121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6759193,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Clark","affiliation":["Middlesex University, UK"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Clark","id":"37529036900"},{"name":"Vinay Kulkarni","affiliation":["Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37296094500"},{"name":"Balbir Barn","affiliation":["Tata Research Development and Design Centre, India"],"firstName":"Balbir","lastName":"Barn","id":"38095530900"},{"name":"Robert France","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"France","id":"37272055900"},{"name":"Ulrich Frank","affiliation":["Middlesex University, UK"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Frank","id":"37620900700"},{"name":"Dan Turk","affiliation":["Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Turk","id":"37086645102"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2504-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6759193","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizations","Analytical models","Context modeling","Adaptation models","Electronic mail","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","organisational aspects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven organization","external business pressures","organizational misalignment","suboptimal configurations","enterprise architecture domain","EA","alignment problems","MDO","alignment management approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enterprise Architecture","Enterprise Modelling","Simulation"]}],"abstract":"Modern organizations are faced with the need to rapidly respond to frequent changes arising from external business pressures. The effect of such continuous evolution eventually leads to organizational misalignment, that is, situations in which sub-optimal configurations of underlying systems significantly reduce an organization's ability to meet its strategic goals. Ensuring alignment of an organization's systems and its goals has been a concern of researchers and practitioners in the enterprise architecture (EA) domain. Unfortunately, current approaches do not adequately address alignment problems that modern organizations face. In this paper we propose that alignment concerns can be better addressed by making models the primary entities that stakeholders within and outside of an organization use to interact with the organization. We call an organization that maintains and uses an integrated set of models to manage alignment concerns a Model Driven Organization (MDO). In this paper we characterize the alignment problem, discuss the shortcomings of current alignment management approaches and present our MDO vision.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.591","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06759193.pdf","startPage":"4817","endPage":"4826","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards the Model Driven Organization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Towards the Model Driven Organization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6759193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14158979","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards the Model Driven Organization","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504e817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092078S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6759193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6759203,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Holm","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Holm","id":"37586464400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2504-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6759203","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759203","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Payloads","Computer architecture","Servers","Testing","Reliability","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","digital signatures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signature based network intrusion detection","zero day attacks","SNIDS","false alarm","zero day detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer security","NIDS","exploits","code injection"]}],"abstract":"A frequent claim that has not been validated is that signature based network intrusion detection systems (SNIDS) cannot detect zero-day attacks. This paper studies this property by testing 356 severe attacks on the SNIDS Snort, configured with an old official rule set. Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded. Analyses of these aspects suggest that a conservative estimate on zero-day detection by Snort is 8.2%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06759203.pdf","startPage":"4895","endPage":"4904","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signature Based Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Attacks: (Not) A Closed Chapter?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Signature Based Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Attacks: (Not) A Closed Chapter?","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6759203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14179229","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759203/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signature Based Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Attacks: (Not) A Closed Chapter?","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504e895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057501S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6759203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6759219,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Pfarr","affiliation":["Chair of Information Systems, University of Wuerzburg"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Pfarr","id":"37086665431"},{"name":"Thomas Buckel","affiliation":["Chair of IS Engineering, University of Wuerzburg"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Buckel","id":"37086651875"},{"name":"Axel Winkelmann","affiliation":["Chair of Information Systems, University of Wuerzburg"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Winkelmann","id":"37845594800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2504-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6759219","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5619},"abstract":"Cloud Computing technologies are gaining increased attention both in academia and practice.

One such novel application is to perform collaborative beamforming from a wireless sensor network consisting of multirotor aerial vehicles (MAVs). Collaborative beamforming from an airborne wireless sensor network can be an effective means of communication from an unobstructed vantage point. This paper explores the feasibility of such a network. We analyze the beam pattern fluctuations due to position errors from the MAV's unsteady station keeping. We show that the effects of minor position errors are manageable. Finally, two non-linear constrained optimization techniques for side lobe suppression utilizing the MAVs mobility and station keeping capability are introduced. We demonstrate through simulation that our techniques have similar performance while requiring lower computational cost and complexity compared to the conventional minimum variance distortion less response beamformer.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2014.630","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/6751593/6758592/06759233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.630","publicationTitle":"2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","startPage":"5122","endPage":"5128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Wireless Aerial Sensor Node Positioning for Randomly Deployed Planar Collaborative Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Wireless Aerial Sensor Node Positioning for Randomly Deployed Planar Collaborative Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759233/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759233/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14158810","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Wireless Aerial Sensor Node Positioning for Randomly Deployed Planar Collaborative Beamforming","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504f122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048702S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6759233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6759235,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew R.

Multicast enables a group of nodes to subscribe to broadcast messages. Reliability ensures that all nodes receive messages correctly, totally-ordered ensures that all nodes receive messages in sequential order. In the proposed architecture, CR nodes employ multicast to exchange radio environment maps and to perform dynamic spectrum access. Emulation and wireless test beds were constructed and baseline unicast quality of service (QoS) measured. The Spread open-source multicast software toolkit was installed on all nodes and the resulting multicast QoS measured. Channel effects were applied to the emulation test bed, so that its QoS modeled that of the wireless test bed. This paper demonstrates that it is feasible to characterize multicast QoS over a CR wireless network, through the use of an equivalent emulated network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759235/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14179220","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759235/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Totally-Ordered, Reliable Multicast over Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Totally-Ordered, Reliable Multicast over Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"2504f135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151248S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6751593","isNumber":"6758592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6751593","xplore-issue":"6758592","articleId":"6759235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6759738,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-8994-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6759738","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Boundary conditions","Circuit boards","Integrated circuits","Very high speed integrated circuits","Hardware design languages","Registers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["boundary scan","boundary-scan architecture","Boundary-Scan Description Language","boundary-scan boundary scan","boundary-scan architecture","Boundary-Scan Description Language (BSDL)","boundary-scan register","circuit boards","circuitry","IEEE 1149.1TM","integrated circuit","printed circuit boards","Procedural Description Language (PDL)","test","test access port (TAP)","very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC)","VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)"]}],"abstract":"Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the test, maintenance and support of assembled printed circuit boards and the test of internal circuits is defined.

In addition, the use of the built-in error-correction code (ECC) showed a large overhead, and proved to be insufficient to provide high reliability. Experimental results with the hardened algorithm show a two orders of magnitude failure rate improvement over the original algorithm (one order of magnitude over ECC) and an overhead 64% smaller than ECC.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/6878498/06759758.pdf","startPage":"1874","endPage":"1880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Based Hardening Strategies for Neutron Sensitive FFT Algorithms on GPUs","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2014.2301768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6878498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2014.2301768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Software-Based Hardening Strategies for Neutron Sensitive FFT Algorithms on GPUs","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14544195","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6759758/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-Based Hardening Strategies for Neutron Sensitive FFT Algorithms on GPUs","sourcePdf":"tns-pilla-2301768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125145S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6878498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6878498","articleId":"6759758","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6759813,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo M.

The performance of the cognitive network in function of the control packet size, was determinate by analysis of collisions when different secondary users trying to access spectrum resources and they make the request to the Spectrum Broker. We observed that there are fewer collisions between control packets and collision probability is smaller if compressive technique is used, thus improving the performance in a fair resource allocation for cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759817","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749518/6759801/06759817.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759817","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized Spectrum Broker and Spectrum Sensing with Compressive Sensing techniques for resource allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Centralized Spectrum Broker and Spectrum Sensing with Compressive Sensing techniques for resource allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759817/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759817/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14148332","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized Spectrum Broker and Spectrum Sensing with Compressive Sensing techniques for resource allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"120199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067868S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749518","isNumber":"6759801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749518","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6759801","articleId":"6759817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6759819,"authors":[{"name":"Adoniran Judson Braga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Adoniran Judson","lastName":"Braga","id":"38556929000"},{"name":"Rausley A.

Aiming at a higher network throughput than in the classic approach, the concept of continuous sensing is used, where secondary receiving nodes are responsible for the spectrum sensing and decision about the presence of the PU while others secondary users (SU) transmit in the same sensed spectrum band. In this paper we compare, in a continuous sensing scheme, the performance of eigenvalue spectrum sensing techniques in a multiple sensor CR network. The soft Akaike information criterion (SAIC) achieves the best performance for detection of the PU signal when the SU signal is strong and the modified maximum eigenvalue detection performs better when the SU signal is week.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigenvalue-based techniques for continuous sensing model in MIMO CR networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759819","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749518/6759801/06759819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Eigenvalue-based techniques for continuous sensing model in MIMO CR networks","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759819/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14148314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenvalue-based techniques for continuous sensing model in MIMO CR networks","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"120205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066923S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749518","isNumber":"6759801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749518","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6759801","articleId":"6759819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6759823,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Pierre Fabris Hoefel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Roger Pierre Fabris","lastName":"Hoefel","id":"37086677196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1148-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"6759823","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":939},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Simulation","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Channel models","Transceivers","IEEE 802.11n Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","precoding","signal detection","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output detectors","MIMO detection","multiuser OFDM MIMO","wireless local area networks","wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11ac","simulation framework","physical layer","regularized channel inversion","block diagonalization precoding","zero forcing detector","minimum mean squared error","802.11 Task Group n","TGac channel models","signal-to-noise-ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["802.11ac","OFDM","MU-MIMO","TGac channel models"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a simulation framework to analyze, design and optimize the physical layer of IEEE 802.11ac wireless local networks focusing on multi-user operation scenario is described and validated.

The performance analysis of the proposed system is based on the mean bit error probability, for which analytical expressions are established. These expressions are verified using Monte-Carlo simulations with excellent agree- ment between both results. The opportunistic transmission can combat the fading efficiently. For this technique the mean bit error probability curves under fading are similar to the mean bit error probability curves of ordinary transmission in an AWGN channel. Furthermore, the opportunistic transmission is less sensitive to co-channel interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of opportunistic wireless transmission in Rayleigh fading channels with co-channel interference","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759826","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749518/6759801/06759826.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of opportunistic wireless transmission in Rayleigh fading channels with co-channel interference","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759826/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14148318","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of opportunistic wireless transmission in Rayleigh fading channels with co-channel interference","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"121464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052506S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749518","isNumber":"6759801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749518","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6759801","articleId":"6759826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6759830,"authors":[{"name":"Maybemar Hern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Circuits, Simon Bolivar University Caracas, Caracas, Venezuela"],"firstName":"Maybemar","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez","id":"38555035800"},{"name":"Rodolfo Alvizu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Circuits, Simon Bolivar University Caracas, Caracas, Venezuela"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Alvizu","id":"38094152900"},{"name":"Christian Dassy","affiliation":["Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas, Distrito Capital, VE"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Dassy"},{"name":"M\u00f3nica Huerta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and ElectricLas Fuerzas Armadas University ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador"],"firstName":"M\u00f3nica","lastName":"Huerta","id":"37267898100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1148-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"6759830","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Power demand","Wavelength division multiplexing","OFDM","Energy consumption","Optical network units","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital signal processing chips","digital-analogue conversion","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","passive optical networks","power consumption","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","ADC/DAC energy consumption","digital-to-analog converter","analog-to-digital converter","DSP","digital signal processing","NG-OAN","next generation optical access networks","WDM-OFDMA-PON","passive optical network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSP","ADC","DAC","Next Generation Optical Access Networks","WDM-OFDMA-PON","energy efficiency","power consumption","processing capacity"]}],"abstract":"Wavelength Division Multiplexing- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access-based Passive Optical Network (WDM-OFDMA-PON) is accepted as one of the most suitable architectures to tackle the requirements for Next Generation Optical Access Networks (NG-OAN). The main technologies for the development of this architecture are the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Analog-To-Digital and Digital-To-Analog converters (ADC/DAC). Current DSP devices' processing capacity is at least one order of magnitude bellow the required for the implementation of WDM-OFDMA-PON, and the bandwidth of ADC/DAC is also a limitative factor. Additionally, due to the access network's massiveness, the DSP's and ADC/DAC energy consumption has become a major concern. In order to describe how long it will take for the DSP's and ADC/DAC devices to cope the requirements for WDM-OFDMA-PON, and how much energy they will consume, in this paper the projections of DSP's and ADC/DAC performance and energy consumption were developed, considering different rates of annual improvement of the technology. Based on our projections, we have demonstrated that the required processing capacity for DSP will be achieved within two to five years from now, and such device will consume approximately twice the amount of power of current processors if the annual rates of improvement of capacity and energy efficiency are maintained.","doi":"10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759830","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749518/6759801/06759830.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCom.2013.6759830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP and ADC/DAC Projections for WDM-OFDMA-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759830/","displayDocTitle":"DSP and ADC/DAC Projections for WDM-OFDMA-PON","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14179064","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759830/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP and ADC/DAC Projections for WDM-OFDMA-PON","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"121576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057887S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749518","isNumber":"6759801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749518","xplore-issue":"6759801","articleId":"6759830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6759879,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Division of Systems Eng., Boston University"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085418662"},{"name":"Daniel Rossell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng., Boston University"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rossell","id":"37888108300"},{"name":"Christos G.

Typical examples include the commonly used Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks (NNs) with pre-allocated centers. As an alternative to these methods, a nonparametric model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) was recently proposed. Using GPs, it was shown that it is possible to maintain constant coverage over the operating domain by adaptively selecting new kernel locations without any previous domain knowledge. However, even if kernel locations provide good coverage of the input domain, incorrect bandwidth selection can result in poor characterization of the model uncertainty, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose methods for learning hyperparameters online in GP-MRAC by optimizing a modified likelihood function. We prove the stability and convergence of our algorithm in closed loop. Finally, we evaluate our methods in simulation on an example of wing rock dynamics. Results show learning hyperparameters online robustly reduces the steady state modeling error and improves control smoothness over other MRAC schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06759990.pdf","startPage":"861","endPage":"867","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6759990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6759990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6759990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric adaptive control using Gaussian Processes with online hyperparameter estimation","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","Gaussian processes","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","radial basis function networks","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric adaptive control","Gaussian process","online hyperparameter estimation","model reference adaptive control method","radial basis function neural networks","RBFNN","GP-MRAC","modified likelihood function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6759990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric adaptive control using Gaussian Processes with online hyperparameter estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6759990/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157512","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric adaptive control using Gaussian Processes with online hyperparameter estimation","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"2084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080085S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6759990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"}]
