It is gaining widespread attention for medium-voltage (MV) grid interfacing to enable increases in renewable energy penetration, and, commercially, the SST is of interest for traction applications due to its light weight as a result of medium-frequency isolation. The recent advancements in silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor device technology are creating a new paradigm with the development of discrete power semiconductor devices in the range of 10-15 kV and even beyond-up to 22 kV, as recently reported. In contrast to silicon (Si) IGBTs, which are limited to 6.5-kV blocking, these high-voltage (HV) SiC devices are enabling much simpler converter topologies and increased efficiency and reliability, with dramatic reductions of the size and weight of the MV power-conversion systems. This article presents the first-ever demonstration results of a three-phase MV grid-connected 100-kVA SST enabled by 15-kV SiC n-IGBTs, with an emphasis on the system design and control considerations. The 15-kV SiC n-IGBTs were developed by Cree and packaged by Powerex. The low-voltage (LV) side of the SST is built with 1,200-V, 100-A SiC MOSFET modules. The galvanic isolation is provided by three single-phase 22-kV/800-V, 10-kHz, 35-kVA-rated high-frequency (HF) transformers. The three-phase all-SiC SST that interfaces with 13.8-kV and 480-V distribution grids is referred to as a transformerless intelligent power substation (TIPS). The characterization of the 15-kV SiC n-IGBTs, the development of the MV isolated gate driver, and the design, control, and system demonstration of the TIPS were undertaken by North Carolina State University's (NCSU's) Future Renewable Electrical Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems Center, sponsored by an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) project.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7240109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7240109/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15432907","volume":"2","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Transformerless Intelligent Power Substation: A three-phase SST enabled by a 15-kV SiC IGBT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transformerless Intelligent Power Substation: A three-phase SST enabled by a 15-kV SiC IGBT","sourcePdf":"02mpel03-mainali-2449271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078072S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570649","isNumber":"7239688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570649","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7239688","articleId":"7240109","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7240110,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538488700"},{"name":"Shouhei Kousai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Shouhei","lastName":"Kousai","id":"37282491800"},{"name":"Kohei Onizuka","affiliation":["Center for Semiconductor R&D, Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Onizuka","id":"37293735900"},{"name":"Song Hu","affiliation":["Center for Semiconductor R&D, Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085355861"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7240110","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1743},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Power generation","CMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","Computer architecture"]}],"abstract":"The ever-growing demand for higher data rates, power efficiency, and robust operations poses increasingly stringent performance requirements on wireless transceiver systems. This is particularly critical for mobile devices in both commercial and defense applications, where improving system size, weight, and power metrics and extending the battery lifetime are often the primary concerns. The power amplifier (PA) serves as the interface between the RF transmitter system and the antenna and is often considered one of the most critical building blocks in a wireless transceiver. This is because the PA's performance has critical impacts on multiple major transmitter metrics, including the output power level, power efficiency, bandwidth, and signal fidelity, and therefore governs the overall quality of service (QoS) of the wireless link [1], [2]. Moreover, due to their large-signal and high-power operations at RF frequencies, PAs often encounter unique design challenges and tradeoffs that deserve special attention [3].","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Wireless Workhorse: Mixed-Signal Power Amplifiers Leverage Digital and Analog Techniques to Enhance Large-Signal RF Operations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2015.2453872","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7239692/07240110.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2015.2453872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7239692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7240110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7240110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"The Wireless Workhorse: Mixed-Signal Power Amplifiers Leverage Digital and Analog Techniques to Enhance Large-Signal RF Operations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7240110/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Wireless Workhorse: Mixed-Signal Power Amplifiers Leverage Digital and Analog Techniques to Enhance Large-Signal RF Operations","sourcePdf":"16mmm09-wang-2453872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216667S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7239692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7239692","articleId":"7240110","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7240279,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Ninomiya","affiliation":["NHK Science and Technical Research Laboratories, Tokyo 157, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Ninomiya","id":"37347677000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0036-1682"}],"articleNumber":"7240279","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7240279","abstract":"A digital transmission broadcasting system must be able to control degradation of the received picture due to transmission errors.

With this method, a digital decoder can separate Y, I, and Q exactly from the PCM signal; with a digital-to-analog conversion, the same PCM signal could be broadcast to standard analog NTSC receivers. The basis of the method is a block interpolation which increases the sampling rate of each component (to 4\u00d7 subcarrier in the example presented here). Proper choice of the interpolation coefficients can produce a signal which approximates an NTSC standard signal. How good the approximation can be is an open question, but an example is given which demonstrates the concept and the design methods.","doi":"10.5594/J01583","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227860/7242078/07242084.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J01583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7242078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7242084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Exactly Decodable PCM Color Television","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7242084/","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Exactly Decodable PCM Color Television","volume":"89","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Exactly Decodable PCM Color Television","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J01583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060202S","chronDate":"Aug.  1980","isNumber":"7242078","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","articleId":"7242084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7242086,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Fujio","affiliation":["Advanced Television System Research Group, Technical Research Laboratories of NHK, 1-10-11, Kinuta, Setagaya, Tokyo 157, Japan., 2Advanced Television System Research Group, Technical Research Laboratories of NHK, 1-10-11, Kinuta, Setagaya, Tokyo 157, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Fujio"},{"name":"Junichi Ishida","firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Ishida"},{"name":"Taro Komoto","firstName":"Taro","lastName":"Komoto"},{"name":"Taiji Nishizawa","firstName":"Taiji","lastName":"Nishizawa"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0036-1682"}],"articleNumber":"7242086","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"abstract":"Since 1968, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.) has been carrying out research into a high-definition wide-screen television system, including development of equipment.

Various systems were considered; however, a head that moved relative to the rotating portion of the scanner and, therefore, transverse to the recorded track on the tape was ultimately selected. Two approaches to physically moving the head transverse to the recorded track were considered in some detail. The approach decided upon uses a piezoelectric element onto which the head transducer is mounted. A bi-morph bender element configuration was found to be ideal.

Two transmission systems have been developed: one in which two separate carriers are frequency modulated by the luminance and chrominance signals respectively and another system which transmits a composite color signal using a color subcarrier. A transmission test has been carried out with the Experimental Broadcasting Satellite (12 GHz, 100 W for each of two channels), and very attractive pictures and sound were received using a 2.5-m diameter receiving antenna.

based on colorless optical polarization beam splitters and an optical polarization-arrangement technique. No optical filter is required to eliminate any specific optical wavelength from the hybrid transport system; the employed optical wavelength and central carrier frequency of the transmitted radio-frequency signal can be dynamically adjusted without alerting the transmission performance of the proposed hybrid transport system. To prove the concept of the quadruple-frequency technique, a 40-GHz millimeter-wave (MMW) signal quadrupled from a 10-GHz signal is experimentally demonstrated in an optical domain. Its advancement is then employed to experimentally accomplish a hybrid OFDM and quadruple-frequency RoF signal transmission over a 25-km span of single-mode fiber. The advancement of the hybrid transport system is evaluated and demonstrated by error-free transmissions and clear eye and constellation diagrams. This proposed system is a great candidate for greatly reducing the cost of simultaneously transmitting OFDM and MMW signals over optical access networks and makes it more practical to be employed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid OFDM and Radio-Over-Fiber Transport System Based on a Polarization Modulator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2476839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7222813/07243295.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2476839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid OFDM and Radio-Over-Fiber Transport System Based on a Polarization Modulator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7243295/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7903708","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15451664","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 101-2221-E-027-041-MY3, MOST 104-2221-E-415-023 and MOST 104-2221-E-027-072-MY3"},{"fundingName":"National Taipei University of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid OFDM and Radio-Over-Fiber Transport System Based on a Polarization Modulator","sourcePdf":"jphot-peng-2476839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067044S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7243295","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243296,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxia Cheng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7959216/7243296/cheng-2469652-small.gif","p":["Yuxia Cheng received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2010.

Commercial servers increasingly use the nonuniform memory access (NUMA) architecture due to its scalable memory performance. However, multiple VMs running on a NUMA physical server will cause performance overheads such as remote memory access latency and shared microarchitectural resource contention, which makes the VM performance less efficient and stable. These performance overheads are mainly caused by memory traffic from data-intensive workloads. In this paper, we propose a traffic-aware VM optimization (TAVO) scheme on NUMA systems. Based on the performance monitoring of the data traffic and CPU/memory resource usages in the system, TAVO addresses VM memory access locality and shared resource contention problems via automatic VM initial placement and NUMA-aware VM online scheduling. Our experimental results show that TAVO improves VM performance in terms of benchmark runtime by up to 22.6% compared with the default KVM CFS scheduler. TAVO also achieves a much stable performance with benchmark's average runtime variation under 3%.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2469652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7959216/07243296.pdf","startPage":"973","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2469652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance-Monitoring-Based Traffic-Aware Virtual Machine Deployment on NUMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance-Monitoring-Based Traffic-Aware Virtual Machine Deployment on NUMA Systems","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7243296/","accessionNumber":"16992956","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003010-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance-Monitoring-Based Traffic-Aware Virtual Machine Deployment on NUMA Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-cheng-2469652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089091S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"7243296","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7243299,"authors":[{"name":"Pierfrancesco Lombardo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET), University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7384408/7243299/lomba-2461594-small.gif","p":["Pierfrancesco Lombardo (S\u201993\u2013M\u201995) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and telecommunications engineering from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 1991 and 1995, respectively.","From 1991 to 1992, he was an Officer Engineer with the Official Test Center, Italian Air Force of Pratica di Mare, Pomezia RM, Italy.

However, the use of only two receiving channels to contain cost, mass, and data-rate, imposes limitations in terms of potentiality of joint clutter cancelation and target velocity estimation. To overcome this problem, we propose a full MIMO SAR scheme obtained by transmitting nearly orthogonal waveforms with the two subarrays achieved from a single antenna aperture and receiving with the same subarrays. A complete processing chain for the joint detection, imaging, and radial speed estimation is presented showing that by properly applying the clutter cancelation step before waveform compression, a good clutter removal performance is obtained despite the waveforms are not fully orthogonal. The performance of the proposed MIMO system is deeply investigated and compared to the performance of conventional multichannel systems to assess the relative merits and drawbacks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7384408/07243299.pdf","startPage":"5081","endPage":"5095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2461594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2461594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384408","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground Moving Target detection Based on MIMO SAR systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Clutter","Synthetic aperture radar","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO radar","object detection","radar clutter","radar imaging","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel space-based synthetic aperture radar systems","receiving antenna subarrays","along-track direction","ground moving target detection","radial motion velocity","SAR image","receiving channels","data-rate","joint clutter cancelation","target velocity estimation","full MIMO SAR system performance","single antenna aperture","processing chain","radial speed estimation","clutter cancelation step","orthogonal waveform compression","clutter removal performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GMTI","MIMO","SAR"]},{"kwd":["GMTI","MIMO","SAR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ground Moving Target detection Based on MIMO SAR systems","volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7243299/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15704956","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground Moving Target detection Based on MIMO SAR systems","sourcePdf":"jstars-pastina-2461594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096755S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7384408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7384408","articleId":"7243299","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243302,"authors":[{"name":"Ilona Piekarz","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7352393/7243302/pieka-2476957-small.gif","p":["Ilona Piekarz received the M.Sc. degree in electronics and telecommunications from the AGH University of Science and Technology (UST), Krak\u00f3w, Poland, in 2013, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","She has been with the Microwave Technology and High Frequency Electronics Research Team, Department of Electronics, AGH UST, since 2011.

Two main schemes are proposed and analyzed in detail, considering system imperfections, specifically, time misalignment issues. It turns out that while multiple service providers can share the network infrastructure using the proposed multiplexing techniques, no gain in the total secret key generation rate is obtained if one uses conventional passive all-optical OFDM decoders. To achieve a linear increase in the key rate with the number of channels, an alternative active setup for OFDM decoding is proposed, which employs an optical switch in addition to conventional passive circuits. We show that by using our proposed decoder, the bandwidth utilization is considerably improved as compared to conventional wavelength-division multiplexing techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexed Quantum Key Distribution","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2476821","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7300504/07243310.pdf","startPage":"4687","endPage":"4698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2476821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexed Quantum Key Distribution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/7243310/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15553360","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Community's Seventh Framework Program","grantNumber":"277110"},{"fundingName":"U.K.'s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M506953/1 and EP/M013472/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexed Quantum Key Distribution","sourcePdf":"jlt-salehi-2476821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086692S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7300504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7300504","articleId":"7243310","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243319,"authors":[{"name":"Flavia Lenti","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INP, IRIT et Centre Europen de Recherche et de Formation Avance en Calcul Scientifique (CERFACS), Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7312390/7243319/lenti-2458014-small.gif","p":["\n\nFlavia Lenti (S'11) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

The reconstruction method is based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method. CG is a well-known method in electromagnetics, where it is commonly used to address inverse problems in Hilbert spaces. However, the method has never been applied to inverse problems related to spatial resolution enhancement of microwave remotely sensed measurements. In this paper, CG is adapted to the microwave radiometer case and exploited to reconstruct the brightness field at enhanced spatial resolution. Then, CG is, for the first time, extended to Banach spaces by means of duality maps and then applied to enhance the radiometer spatial resolution. Experiments undertaken on both simulated and actual radiometer data confirm the soundness of the proposed approach in Banach spaces and demonstrate that CG is able to provide a reconstruction accuracy similar to the conventional Landweber method, but with a significantly reduced processing time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave radiometry","Spatial resolution","Microwave theory and techniques","Hilbert space","Extraterrestrial measurements","Microwave measurement","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient method","Hilbert space","Banach space","radiometer data spatial resolution","computer-time effective iterative method","microwave radiometer data","microwave remotely sensed measurements","conventional Landweber method","reduced processing time","satellite remote sensing","Earth observation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse problems","microwave radiometry","resolution enhancement"]},{"kwd":["Inverse problems","microwave radiometry","resolution enhancement"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2458014","startPage":"397","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7312390/07243319.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2458014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conjugate Gradient Method in Hilbert and Banach Spaces to Enhance the Spatial Resolution of Radiometer Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Conjugate Gradient Method in Hilbert and Banach Spaces to Enhance the Spatial Resolution of Radiometer Data","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568369","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","volume":"54","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243319/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate Gradient Method in Hilbert and Banach Spaces to Enhance the Spatial Resolution of Radiometer Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-migliaccio-2458014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089039S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7312390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7312390","articleId":"7243319","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7243320,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Andalibi","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7243320/andal-2476961-small.gif","p":["Mehran Andalibi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tehran Polytechnic University, Iran, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Oklahoma State University, USA, in 2014, all in mechanical engineering.

The key advantage of such an approach is the ability to visually analyze the extracted logo for rapid visual authentication and other visual tasks. However, logos pose new challenges for invisible watermarking applications which need to keep the watermark imperceptible within the host image while simultaneously maintaining robustness to attacks. This paper presents an algorithm for invisible grayscale logo watermarking that operates via adaptive texturization of the logo. The central idea of our approach is to recast the watermarking task into a texture similarity task. We first separate the host image into sufficiently textured and poorly textured regions. Next, for textured regions, we transform the logo into a visually similar texture via the Arnold transform and one lossless rotation; whereas for poorly textured regions, we use only a lossless rotation. The iteration for the Arnold transform and the angle of lossless rotation are determined by a model of visual texture similarity. Finally, for each region, we embed the transformed logo into that region via a standard wavelet-based embedding scheme. We employ a multistep extraction stage, in which an affine parameter estimation is first performed to compensate for possible geometrical transformations. Testing with multiple logos on a database of host images and under a variety of attacks demonstrates that the proposed algorithm yields better overall performance than competing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2476961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07243320.pdf","startPage":"5060","endPage":"5073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2476961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Image Watermarking via Adaptive Logo Texturization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Digital Image Watermarking via Adaptive Logo Texturization","volume":"24","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15591499","pubMedId":"26353371","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243320/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243320/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1054612"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Image Watermarking via Adaptive Logo Texturization","sourcePdf":"tip-andalibi-2476961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082299S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7243320","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7243322,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A novel blind identification approach is introduced in this brief, allowing us to model type 1 diabetic patients and to effectively recover the unmeasured input signals. The approach is applied to an experimental study regarding identification and prediction of the blood glucose concentration in five type 1 diabetic patients.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2462734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/7454797/07243322.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7454797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2462734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Blind Identification Approach to Modeling of Diabetic Patients","volume":"24","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243322/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935012","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243322/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear Blind Identification Approach to Modeling of Diabetic Patients","sourcePdf":"tcst-novara-2462734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07519S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7454797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7454797","articleId":"7243322","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7243327,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Feix","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/7389462/7243327/feix-2470657-small.gif","p":["Thomas Feix received the M.Sc. degree in sports equipment technology\n from the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the Vienna\n University of Technology, Vienna, in 2011.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Associate with the GRAB Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yale\n University, New Haven, CT, USA.

We consider only static and stable grasps performed by one hand. The goal is to extract the largest set of different grasps that were referenced in the literature and arrange them in a systematic way. The taxonomy provides a common terminology to define human hand configurations and is important in many domains such as human-computer interaction and tangible user interfaces where an understanding of the human is basis for a proper interface. Overall, 33 different grasp types are found and arranged into the GRASP taxonomy. Within the taxonomy, grasps are arranged according to 1) opposition type, 2) the virtual finger assignments, 3) type in terms of power, precision, or intermediate grasp, and 4) the position of the thumb. The resulting taxonomy incorporates all grasps found in the reviewed taxonomies that complied with the grasp definition. We also show that due to the nature of the classification, the 33 grasp types might be reduced to a set of 17 more general grasps if only the hand configuration is considered without the object shape/size.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6221037/7389462/7243327-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","volume":"46","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15722303","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7243327/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The GRASP Taxonomy of Human Grasp Types","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GRASP","grantNumber":"EU IST-FP7-IP"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-0953856"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"The GRASP Taxonomy of Human Grasp Types","sourcePdf":"thms-feix-2470657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141537S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7389462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"7389462","articleId":"7243327","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7243329,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Bandemer","affiliation":["Information Theory and Applications Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Rasa Networks, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bernd Bandemer (S\u201906\u2013M\u201912) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2006 from Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2012.

Generally, there are some situations where a user is interested in not only maximizing the classification performance but also minimizing the cost that may be associated with features. This kind of problem is called cost-based feature selection. However, most existing feature selection approaches treat this task as a single-objective optimization problem. This paper presents the first study of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) for cost-based feature selection problems. The task of this paper is to generate a Pareto front of nondominated solutions, that is, feature subsets, to meet different requirements of decision-makers in real-world applications. In order to enhance the search capability of the proposed algorithm, a probability-based encoding technology and an effective hybrid operator, together with the ideas of the crowding distance, the external archive, and the Pareto domination relationship, are applied to PSO. The proposed PSO-based multi-objective feature selection algorithm is compared with several multi-objective feature selection algorithms on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically evolve a set of nondominated solutions, and it is a highly competitive feature selection method for solving cost-based feature selection problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16652668","pubMedId":"26353379","htmlLink":"/document/7243331/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2017","volume":"14","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Approach for Cost-Based Feature Selection in Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2013QNA51"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473299"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project","grantNumber":"2014T70557"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Approach for Cost-Based Feature Selection in Classification","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhang-2476796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09501S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7842713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"7842713","articleId":"7243331","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243332,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Mu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7243332/mu-2476804_print-small.gif","p":["\nHua Mu (S'11\u2013M'13) received the B.S. degree in applied physics from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA, in 2012.

The cognitive radio users help to secure primary user's transmission against the eavesdropper and in return, the primary user allows the secondary users to access its licensed spectrum. All users are equipped with multiple antennas. We investigate the secure DoF using the interference alignment concept coupled with a zero inter-user interference constraint. We propose a beamforming design based only on the channel state information (CSI) between the primary and secondary user pairs which the legitimate users exchange among each other; no information data are exchanged and no eavesdropper CSI is needed.

The theoretical expression of the LMMSE channel estimation is formulated and a simpler closed-form is derived. The MSE analysis shows that LMMSE inevitably reaches an error floor due to the interference inherent to OFDM/OQAM modulation. Furthermore, an algorithm for the joint MMSE estimation of both the channel and the noise variance (J-MCNE) is proposed and features a reduced complexity thanks to the low-rank approximation method. The noise level estimation represents a challenge as it is concealed in the intrinsic interferences generated by the OFDM/OQAM. Simulations reveal the capability of the proposed J-MCNE method to estimate the noise variance and show that the achieved bit error rate (BER) is close to that of the perfect estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07243338.pdf","startPage":"4254","endPage":"4266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2476798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2476798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint MMSE Channel and Noise Variance Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Estimation","Covariance matrices","Noise","Approximation methods","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","bit error rate","intrinsic interferences","noise level estimation","low-rank approximation method","J-MCNE method","joint MMSE channel and noise variance estimation","MSE analysis","LMMSE channel estimation","OFDM-OQAM system","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MMSE-based multipath channel","minimum mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","channel estimation","LMMSE","noise variance"]},{"kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","channel estimation","LMMSE","noise variance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Joint MMSE Channel and Noise Variance Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Modulation","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7243338/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676740","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"PROFIL (Evolution of the Wideband Professional Mobile Radio Based on the Filter Bank MultiCarrier Modulation)"},{"fundingName":"French national research agency (ANR)","grantNumber":"ANR-13-INFR-0007-03"},{"fundingName":"ICT EC-funded project Newcom#","grantNumber":"FP7-IC-318306"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint MMSE Channel and Noise Variance Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-savaux-2476798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08959S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7243338","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243344,"authors":[{"name":"Bart\u0142omiej B\u0142aszczyszyn","affiliation":["Inria-ENS, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7243344/blasz-2476465-small.gif","p":["Bart\u0142omiej B\u0142aszczyszyn received the Ph.D. and Habilitation degrees in applied mathematics from the University of Wroc\u0142aw, Wroclaw, Poland, in 1995 and 2008, respectively.

This model permits studying the spatial distribution of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) in the downlink. In particular, this distribution is shown to be insensitive to the distribution of antenna azimuths. Moreover, the effect of horizontal sectorization is shown to be equivalent to that of shadowing. Assuming ideal vertical antenna pattern, an explicit expression of the Laplace transform of the inverse of SINR is given. The model is validated by comparing its results to measurements in an operational network. It is observed numerically that, in the case of dense urban regions where interference is preponderant, one may neglect the effect of the vertical sectorization when calculating the distribution of the SINR, which provides considerable tractability. Combined with queuing theory results, the SINR's distribution permits to express the user's quality of service as function of the traffic demand. This permits in particular to operators to predict the required investments to face the continual increase of traffic demand.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2476465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07243344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2476465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","startPage":"581","endPage":"593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Distribution of the SINR in Poisson Cellular Networks With Sector Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Distribution of the SINR in Poisson Cellular Networks With Sector Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697398","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7243344/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Distribution of the SINR in Poisson Cellular Networks With Sector Antennas","sourcePdf":"twc-karray-2476465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068171S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7243344","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243348,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Chase","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7944974/7243348/chase-2476812-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Chase received the MEng degree in the Department of Computer\n Science from the University of Warwick, United Kingdom in 2011.

Increasingly, Virtual Machines (VMs) have high bandwidth requirements; however, previous research does not fully address the challenge of both VM and bandwidth provisioning. To efficiently provision resources, a joint approach that combines VMs and bandwidth allocation is required. Furthermore, in practice, demand is uncertain. Service providers allow the reservation of resources. However, due to the dangers of over- and under-provisioning, we employ stochastic programming to account for this risk. To improve the efficiency of the stochastic optimization, we reduce the problem space with a scenario tree reduction algorithm, that significantly increases tractability, whilst remaining a good heuristic. Further we perform a sensitivity analysis that finds the tolerance of our solution to parameter changes. Based on historical demand data, we use a deterministic equivalent formulation to find that our solution is optimal and responds well to changes in parameter values. We also show that sensitivity analysis of prices can be useful for both users and providers in maximizing cost efficiency.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7944974/07243348.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2476812","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2476812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243348/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243348/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2017","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16948559","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 1","grantNumber":"RG18/13 and RG33/12"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"MOE Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC 4/15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tsc-chase-2476812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088389S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7944974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7944974","articleId":"7243348","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243350,"authors":[{"name":"Son Ngoc Truong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/7322313/7243350/truon-small.gif","p":["Son Ngoc Truong received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic\n engineering from the University of Technical Education, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

In addition, we employ the style and semantic attributes of images to further boost the aesthetics categorization performance . Experimental results show that our approach produces significantly better results than the earlier reported results on the AVA dataset for both the generic image aesthetics and content -based image aesthetics.

This paper proposes a comprehensive deep learning framework to jointly learn face representation using multimodal information. The proposed deep learning structure is composed of a set of elaborately designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a three-layer stacked auto-encoder (SAE). The set of CNNs extracts complementary facial features from multimodal data. Then, the extracted features are concatenated to form a high-dimensional feature vector, whose dimension is compressed by SAE. All of the CNNs are trained using a subset of 9,000 subjects from the publicly available CASIA-WebFace database, which ensures the reproducibility of this work. Using the proposed single CNN architecture and limited training data, 98.43% verification rate is achieved on the LFW database. Benefitting from the complementary information contained in multimodal data, our small ensemble system achieves higher than 99.0% recognition rate on LFW using publicly available training set.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Face Recognition via Multimodal Deep Face Representation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2477042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7302100/07243358.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2477042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust Face Recognition via Multimodal Deep Face Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7243358/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FT-130101457, DP-120103730 and DP-140102164"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Face Recognition via Multimodal Deep Face Representation","sourcePdf":"tmm-ding-2477042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098475S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7243358","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243359,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7355262/7243359/zhili-2467383-small.gif","p":["\n               Zhigang Li (S13) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011, where he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

The coupling in cold seasons precludes CHPs from providing the necessary flexibility for managing the wind power dispatch. The lack of flexibility problem can be tackled by exploiting the energy storage capability of a district heating network (DHN) which decouples the strong linkage of electric power and heat supplies. In this paper, a combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) is formulated to coordinate the operation of electric power system (EPS) and district heating system (DHS). The proposed CHPD model which is solved by an iterative method considers the temperature dynamics of DHN for exploiting energy storage as an option for managing the variability of wind energy. The simulation results are discussed for several test systems to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed method in terms of operation economics, wind power utilization, as well as the potential benefits for real systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"7","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677359","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7243359/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Considering Pipeline Energy Storage of District Heating Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015BAA01B01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51177080 and 51321005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Considering Pipeline Energy Storage of District Heating Network","sourcePdf":"tste-wu-2467383-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134058S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7355262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"7355262","articleId":"7243359","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7243360,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Mohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7277156/7243360/moham-2476916-small.gif","p":["Arash Mohammadi (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from York University, ON, Canada, in 2005, 2007, and 2013, respectively.

In several distributed estimation problems, a suitable model to describe the underlying system is unknown a priori, i.e., distributed state estimation with structural uncertainty. Motivated by application of widely linear processing techniques in such problems, the paper proposes a class of distributed multiple-model adaptive estimation algorithms, referred to as the CD/MMAE. By incorporating the particular structure of the complex-valued observations on the second moment, first we develop two hierarchical CD/MMAE implementations and then use them as the building blocks and develop a diffusion-based hybrid estimator for decentralized estimation without incorporation of a fusion centre. The paper derives a new form of the adaptation law and a new form of information fusion, which takes advantage of the full second-order statistical properties of the underlying observations. Convergence properties of the proposed diffusion-based CD/MMAE are then investigated. We show that the adaptive weight of all local nodes converges to the true mode with probability one. Simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid estimators provide improved performance and convergence properties over their traditional counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7243360/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15485692","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Widely Linear Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ontario Research Fund (ORF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Widely Linear Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsipn-mohammadi-2476916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087338S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"7277156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7277156","articleId":"7243360","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7243361,"authors":[{"name":"Ashikur Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7243361/7243361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashikur Rahman (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA, in 2012, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA.","Upon graduation, he was an RF planning Engineer with Telenor Bangladesh.

Stationary continuous-wave Doppler radar has been used for displacement measurement and vital signs detection. However, on a mobile platform, measurements become challenging due to motion artifacts induced by the platform. In this work, a complete compensated single transceiver radar system for vital signs detection in the presence of platform movement is demonstrated. In earlier related work, motion of the radar module was determined using cameras installed on site. However, practical mobile monitoring applications would preclude the use of such stationary cameras. In this work, an RF tag and a low IF radar architecture with an adaptive noise cancellation technique is employed to extract desired vital signs motion information even in the presence of large platform motion.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2471998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7287831/07243361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2471998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287831","startPage":"3034","endPage":"3041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-IF Tag-Based Motion Compensation Technique for Mobile Doppler Radar Life Signs Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-IF Tag-Based Motion Compensation Technique for Mobile Doppler Radar Life Signs Monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488883","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7243361/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-IF Tag-Based Motion Compensation Technique for Mobile Doppler Radar Life Signs Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tmtt-rahman-2471998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077744S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7287831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7287831","articleId":"7243361","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7243366,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Raak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Fredrik Raak (S'13) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2013.

The mathematical technique is called the Koopman mode analysis (KMA) and stems from a spectral analysis of the so-called Koopman operator. Here, KMA is numerically approximated by applying an Arnoldi-like algorithm recently first applied to power system dynamics. In this paper we propose a practical data-driven algorithm incorporating KMA for network partitioning. Comparisons are made with two techniques previously applied for the network partitioning: spectral graph theory which is based on the eigenstructure of the graph Laplacian, and slow-coherency which identifies coherent groups of generators for a specified number of low-frequency modes. The partitioning results share common features with results obtained with graph theory and slow-coherency-based techniques. The suggested partitioning method is evaluated with two test systems, and similarities between Koopman modes and Laplacian eigenvectors are showed numerically and elaborated theoretically.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2464779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2464779","startPage":"2799","endPage":"2808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7463573/07243366.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Partitioning of Power Networks Via Koopman Mode Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Partitioning of Power Networks Via Koopman Mode Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243366/","accessionNumber":"15985791","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243366/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Partitioning of Power Networks Via Koopman Mode Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-raak-2464779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149019S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7463573","articleId":"7243366","onlineDate":"04 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7243367,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Cheng Liu","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7243367/7243367-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Cheng Liu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","In 2011, he joined MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he has been working on analog-to-digital converters for video receivers and wireless communication systems.

To achieve low power at 5 GS/s, the ADC combines pipelined and SAR quantizers, powered at 1.8 V and 1 V, respectively. A 2.5 b 2-way time-interleaved 2.5 GS/s multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) is followed by an 8 b 8-way time-interleaved 625 MHz successive-approximation register (SAR). This architecture combines the benefits of both ADC topologies and allows significant power and complexity reduction. The high-speed 2.5 b MDAC front-end simplifies the complexity of time-interleaving (TI) and provides gain for attenuating the 8 b SAR non-idealities, when referred to the ADC input, relaxing its specifications and design. To further reduce power, the 2.5 b MDAC front-end is SHA-less, and an over-range calibration loop that allows operation at multi-GHz input is introduced. A calibration technique is also proposed to align the MDAC and SAR references, whose misalignment would otherwise produce integral non-linearity (INL) degradation. The ADC achieves -61.8 dB THD, 57.1 dB SNR for a 500 MHz input, while for a 2.35 GHz input it achieves -54.7 dB THD, 46.8 dB SNR (55.8 dB SNR excluding the integrated PLL contribution). The time-interleaving spur is 70 dBc.

This model of competitive distributed computation enables every user connected to the Internet to participate in a game in which he splits his computational power among a set of competing pools -- the game is called a computational power splitting game. We formally model this game and show its utility in analyzing the security of pool protocols that dictate how financial rewards are shared among the members of a pool. As a case study, we analyze the Bitcoin crypto currency which attracts computing power roughly equivalent to billions of desktop machines, over 70% of which is organized into public pools. We show that existing pool reward sharing protocols are insecure in our game-theoretic analysis under an attack strategy called the \"block withholding attack\". This attack is a topic of debate, initially thought to be ill-incentivized in today's pool protocols: i.e., causing a net loss to the attacker, and later argued to be always profitable. Our analysis shows that the attack is always well-incentivized in the long-run, but may not be so for a short duration. This implies that existing pool protocols are insecure, and if the attack is conducted systematically, Bitcoin pools could lose millions of dollars worth in months. The equilibrium state is a mixed strategy -- that is -- in equilibrium all clients are incentivized to probabilistically attack to maximize their payoffs rather than participate honestly. As a result, the Bitcoin network is incentivized to waste a part of its resources simply to compete.","doi":"10.1109/CSF.2015.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSF.2015.34","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 28th Computer Security Foundations Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 28th Computer Security Foundations Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/7243288/7243713/07243747.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Power Splitting Games in Distributed Computation: The Case of Bitcoin Pooled Mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Power Splitting Games in Distributed Computation: The Case of Bitcoin Pooled Mining","conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15435792","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243747/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Power Splitting Games in Distributed Computation: The Case of Bitcoin Pooled Mining","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"7538a397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16389S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7243288","isNumber":"7243713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7243288","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7243713","articleId":"7243747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7243750,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Xu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Xu","id":"38021322300"},{"name":"Danfeng Daphne Yao","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Danfeng Daphne","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085614989"},{"name":"Barbara G.

Code-reuse attacks such as return-oriented programming allow intruders to execute mal-intended instruction sequences on a victim machine without injecting external code. We introduce a new anomaly-based detection technique that probabilistically models and learns a program's control flows for high-precision behavioral reasoning and monitoring. Our prototype in Linux is named STILO, which stands for STatically InitiaLized markOv. Experimental evaluation involves real-world code-reuse exploits and over 4,000 testcases from server and utility programs. STILO achieves up to 28-fold of improvement in detection accuracy over the state-of-the-art HMM-based anomaly detection. Our findings suggest that the probabilistic modeling of program dependences provides a significant source of behavior information for building high-precision models for real-time system monitoring.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 28th Computer Security Foundations Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/7243288/7243713/07243750.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 28th Computer Security Foundations Symposium","doi":"10.1109/CSF.2015.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSF.2015.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Program Modeling for High-Precision Anomaly Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Computational modeling","Probabilistic logic","Analytical models","Training","Mathematical model","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","inference mechanisms","Linux","pattern classification","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic program modeling","high-precision anomaly classification","advanced modern exploits","stealthy attacks","code-reuse attacks","return-oriented programming","mal-intended instruction sequences","victim machine","anomaly-based detection technique","program control flows","high-precision behavioral reasoning","STILO","Linux","statically initialized Markov","real-world code-reuse exploits","state-of-the-art HMM-based anomaly detection","program dependences","high-precision models","real-time system monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","static program analysis","hidden Markov model","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Program Modeling for High-Precision Anomaly Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7243750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15435802","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Program Modeling for High-Precision Anomaly Classification","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"7538a497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.195659S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7243288","isNumber":"7243713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7243288","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7243713","articleId":"7243750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7243896,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The project results achieved in the design of the digital front-end stage of a receiver conforming to the new \u201cDVB-T\u201d European standard for over-the-air TV broadcasting are highlighted. This DVB-T standard is based on the COFDM (coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) technique and is the result of the technical efforts dedicated to the definition of a digital terrestrial television system in past years in Europe. An optimized channel decoder architecture, taking advantage of the most recent VLSI technologies in order to achieve a cost-effective solution for the receiver (or set-top box), is proposed. This work is carried out to encourage early introduction of a digital terrestrial television service in Europe, expected by the beginning of 1998, while the demonstrator is planned for extensive field trials in the second half of 1997. The four-chip prototype is based on state-of-the-art complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 0.5-\u00b5m, 3.3-V, 3-metal-layer very large scale integration (VLSI) technology. Moreover, a cooperative methodology has been implemented to validate the silicon and the demonstrator.","doi":"10.5594/J17642","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227860/7243889/07243896.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J17642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Prototype VLSI Solution for Digital Terrestrial TV Receivers Conforming to the DVB-T Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7243896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7243896/","displayDocTitle":"A Prototype VLSI Solution for Digital Terrestrial TV Receivers Conforming to the DVB-T Standard","volume":"106","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prototype VLSI Solution for Digital Terrestrial TV Receivers Conforming to the DVB-T Standard","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J17642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024333S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"7243889","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7243896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244167,"authors":[{"name":"Bertrand Le Gal","affiliation":["Bordeaux INP, IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Le Gal","id":"37271500000"},{"name":"Christophe Jego","affiliation":["Bordeaux INP, IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Jego","id":"37271502500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7244167","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":725},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244167","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Throughput","Graphics processing units","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","embedded systems","graphics processing units","low-power electronics","microcontrollers","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput LDPC decoder","low-power embedded processors","hardware architectures","CPU devices","GPU devices","latencies","ARM-based decoders","10-layered-decoding iterations","low-power programmable architecture","low-density parity check code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ARM processor","LDPC","SIMD","multi-core"]},{"kwd":["ARM processor","LDPC","SIMD","multi-core"]}],"abstract":"Real-time efficient implementations of LDPC decoders have long been considered exclusively reachable using dedicated hardware architectures.

Compared to multi-antenna aided systems being built at the time of this writing, such as the long-term evolution (LTE) based fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system which allows for up to eight antenna elements at the base station (BS), the LS-MIMO system entails an unprecedented number of antennas, say 100 or more, at the BS. The huge leap in the number of BS antennas opens the door to a new research field in communication theory, propagation and electronics, where random matrix theory begins to play a dominant role. Interestingly, LS-MIMOs also constitute a perfect example of one of the key philosophical principles of the Hegelian Dialectics, namely, that \u201cquantitative change leads to qualitative change.\u201d In this treatise, we provide a recital on the historic heritages and novel challenges facing LS-MIMOs from a detection perspective. First, we highlight the fundamentals of MIMO detection, including the nature of co-channel interference (CCI), the generality of the MIMO detection problem, the received signal models of both linear memoryless MIMO channels and dispersive MIMO channels exhibiting memory, as well as the complex-valued versus real-valued MIMO system models. Then, an extensive review of the representative MIMO detection methods conceived during the past 50 years (1965-2015) is presented, and relevant insights as well as lessons are inferred for the sake of designing complexity-scalable MIMO detection algorithms that are potentially applicable to LS-MIMO systems. Furthermore, we divide the LS-MIMO systems into two types, and elaborate on the distinct detection strategies suitable for each of them. The type-I LS-MIMO corresponds to the case where the number of active users is much smaller than the number of BS antennas, which is currently the mainstream definition of LS-MIMO. The type-II LS-MIMO corresponds to the case where the number of active users is comparable to the number of BS antennas. Finally, we discuss the applicability of existing MIMO detection algorithms in LS-MIMO systems, and review some of the recent advances in LS-MIMO detection.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2475242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2475242","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1988","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7331734/07244171.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fifty Years of MIMO Detection: The Road to Large-Scale MIMOs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fifty Years of MIMO Detection: The Road to Large-Scale MIMOs","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15602559","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244171/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Councils UK (RCUK)"},{"fundingName":"India-UK Advanced Technology Center (IU-ATC)"},{"fundingName":"EU"},{"fundingName":"Concerto project"},{"fundingName":"European Research Councils Advanced Fellow Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fifty Years of MIMO Detection: The Road to Large-Scale MIMOs","sourcePdf":"comst-hanzo-2475242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT1.080898S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7331734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"318","xplore-issue":"7331734","articleId":"7244171","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7244190,"authors":[{"name":"Araz Darba","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Energy, Systems and Automation, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7244190/darba-2477262-small.gif","p":["\n\nAraz Darba (S'06) was born in Ardabil, Iran, in 1983.

Conventional cascade proportional-integral (derivative) [PI(D)] controllers are often used to control speed, torque, and current. However, for low-inertia machines, achieving a high-performance and wide speed range is far beyond the application conditions for which these controllers are designed for. Using two cascaded PI(D) controllers for the speed/current control of a low-inertia machine, changes in the speed set point should be slowly applied in order to avoid stability problems. In this paper, a model predictive control algorithm that is able to control the speed of a low-inertia brushless direct-current machine with a high bandwidth and good disturbance rejection properties is proposed. The algorithm is implemented on a SPARTAN 3E 1600 field-programmable gate-array board, and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07244190.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Dynamic Behavior in BLDC Drives Using Model Predictive Speed and Current Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Predictive models","Cost function","Torque","Rotors","Inverters","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","electric current control","machine control","predictive control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field-programmable gate-array board","low-inertia brushless direct-current machine","model-based predictive control","current control","model predictive speed control","BLDC drives","improved dynamic behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model predictive control (MPC)","permanent magnet brushless DC machine (BLDC machine)","speed control","dynamic stiffness","field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)"]},{"kwd":["Dynamic stiffness","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","model predictive control (MPC)","permanent-magnet brushless dc (BLDC) machine","speed control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved Dynamic Behavior in BLDC Drives Using Model Predictive Speed and Current Control","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7244190/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697158","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Belgian Science Policy Office"},{"fundingName":"Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme (IAP)","grantNumber":"B/12874/01-IUP-VII-02"},{"fundingName":"Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)","grantNumber":"G.0083.13N"},{"fundingName":"FWO"},{"fundingName":"IAP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Dynamic Behavior in BLDC Drives Using Model Predictive Speed and Current Control","sourcePdf":"tie-darba-2477262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082503S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7244190","onlineDate":"08 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244191,"authors":[{"name":"Jongkyoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7244191/jkim-2477270-small.gif","p":["\n\nJongkyoo Kim (S'15) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering \nfrom Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2008, where he is currently working \ntoward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests include the control of nonlinear systems and fuzzy systems."]},"firstName":"Jongkyoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085664608"},{"name":"Hangil Joe","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7244191/joe-2477270-small.gif","p":["\n\nHangil Joe (S'13) was born in Haman, Korea, in 1986.

A conventional TDC performs well when the involved data acquisition rate is fast. However, in AUV control applications that use a Doppler velocity log (DVL) navigation system, we cannot keep the data acquisition rate sufficiently fast because a DVL sensor generally supplies data at a slow acquisition rate, which degrades the performance of the TDC. To overcome this problem, we propose an integral sliding-mode controller to be supplemented to the conventional TDC to improve the control precision even if the DVL navigation system is in operation. The proposed controller is computationally simple and robust to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances. We performed computer simulations and experiments with the Cyclops AUV to demonstrate the validity of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07244191.pdf","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Delay Controller Design for Position Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Under Disturbances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Time-Delay Controller Design for Position Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Under Disturbances","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244191/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697109","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244191/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the \u201cICT Consilience Creative Program\u201d","grantNumber":"IITP-2015-R0346-15-1007"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Delay Controller Design for Position Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Under Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2477270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086085S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7244191","onlineDate":"08 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7244195,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Canzar","affiliation":["Center for Computational Biology, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7857822/7244195/canza-2455551-small.gif","p":["\nStefan Canzar received that Diploma in computer science from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany, in 2004, and the bi-national doctoral degree in computer science from Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, and Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Nancy, France, in 2008.","From 2009 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2014, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the Johns Hopkins Institute of Genetic Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA, respectively.

Accompanied by a dramatic reduction in cost since its introduction in 2004, NGS technology has provided a new way of addressing a wide range of biological and biomedical questions, from the study of human genetic disease to the analysis of gene expression, protein-DNA interactions, and patterns of DNA methylation. The data generated by NGS instruments comprise huge numbers of very short DNA sequences, or \u201creads,\u201d that carry little information by themselves. These reads therefore have to be pieced together by well-engineered algorithms to reconstruct biologically meaningful measurements, such as the level of expression of a gene. To solve this complex, high-dimensional puzzle, reads must be mapped back to a reference genome to determine their origin. Due to sequencing errors and to genuine differences between the reference genome and the individual being sequenced, this mapping process must be tolerant of mismatches, insertions, and deletions. Although optimal alignment algorithms to solve this problem have long been available, the practical requirements of aligning hundreds of millions of short reads to the 3-billion-base-pair-long human genome have stimulated the development of new, more efficient methods, which today are used routinely throughout the world for the analysis of NGS data.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455551","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7857822/07244195.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short Read Mapping: An Algorithmic Tour","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Short Read Mapping: An Algorithmic Tour","volume":"105","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16690028","pubMedId":"28502990","htmlLink":"/document/7244195/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01 HG006102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short Read Mapping: An Algorithmic Tour","sourcePdf":"jproc-canzar-2455551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225026S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7857822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7857822","articleId":"7244195","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244196,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7959216/7244196/yoshi-2469783-small.gif","p":["\n\nRyota Yoshizawa (S'11) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

In many recent wireless standards that pursue higher spectral efficiency, signaling techniques with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have been adopted, but they typically end up with poor PA efficiency. A variety of PAPR reduction approaches have been thus proposed in literature to improve the power efficiency from the physical-layer perspective. In this paper, we investigate how much improvement in terms of the power efficiency can be achieved by such PAPR reduction techniques for OFDM signaling, and we evaluate the achievable coded frame error rate (FER) from a viewpoint of system-level design. It reveals that, in addition to the improvement of the PA efficiency, carefully designed PAPR reduction techniques in fact have a potential of reducing the required signal-to-noise power ratio at a receiver for achieving a given target FER and reducing the duty cycle of a transmitter circuit for a given target information rate. This in turn helps in reducing the total energy consumed at the transmitter of mobile terminals and thus leads to greener communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Coded OFDM Systems Based on PAPR Reduction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2469783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7959216/07244196.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2469783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Coded OFDM Systems Based on PAPR Reduction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7244196/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16992911","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) through the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)","grantNumber":"23686058"},{"fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science through KAKENHI","grantNumber":"25\u00b7195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Coded OFDM Systems Based on PAPR Reduction","sourcePdf":"jsyst-yoshizawa-2469783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09595S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"7244196","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244197,"authors":[{"name":"Giampiero Contestabile","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giampiero","lastName":"Contestabile","id":"37273631000"},{"name":"Philippe Velha","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Velha","id":"37546019800"},{"name":"Nicola Andriolli","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Andriolli","id":"37283356100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7244197","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244197","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Differential phase shift keying","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Demodulation","Optical attenuators","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrayed waveguide gratings","channel spacing","demodulators","differential phase shift keying","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","integrated optoelectronics","optical communication equipment","optical design techniques","optical waveguide filters","semiconductor optical amplifiers","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed InP-integrated preamplified demodulator","WDM-DPSK signals","compact demodulator","wavelength division multiplexed-differential phase shift keying signals","semiconductor optical preamplifier","photonic integrated circuit","ad hoc arrayed waveguide grating","WDM comb","narrow filtering","channel demodulation","AWG outputs","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["InP photonic integrated circuits","Differential phase shift keying (DPSK)","Semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]},{"kwd":["InP photonic integrated circuits","differential phase shift keying (DPSK)","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]}],"abstract":"A compact demodulator for wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)-differential phase shift keying signals monolithically integrated in an InP platform with a semiconductor optical pre-amplifier is reported.

Traffic light-based methods have been efficient but are not able to deal with the growing mobility and social challenges. On the other hand, the advancements of automation and communications have enabled cooperative intersection management, where road users, infrastructure, and traffic control centers are able to communicate and coordinate the traffic safely and efficiently. Major techniques and solutions for cooperative intersections are surveyed in this paper for both signalized and nonsignalized intersections, whereas focuses are put on the latter. Cooperative methods, including time slots and space reservation, trajectory planning, and virtual traffic lights, are discussed in detail. Vehicle collision warning and avoidance methods are discussed to deal with uncertainties. Concerning vulnerable road users, pedestrian collision avoidance methods are discussed. In addition, an introduction to major projects related to cooperative intersection management is presented. A further discussion of the presented works is given with highlights of future research topics. This paper serves as a comprehensive survey of the field, aiming at stimulating new methods and accelerating the advancement of automated and cooperative intersections.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7244203/","accessionNumber":"15754901","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Intersection Management: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Intersection Management: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tits-chen-2471812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158854S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7394960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"7394960","articleId":"7244203","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":7244209,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Harun Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7244209/yilma-2477088_print-small.gif","p":["\nMustafa Harun Y\u0131lmaz was born in Bursa, Turkey.

In this paper, we consider multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiple access cognitive heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and we study the potential benefits of employing RA in terms of improving the overall network capacity. In cognitive HetNets, a secondary network is allowed to share the spectrum with the primary network under the condition that the interference level experienced by the primary network is below a predetermined threshold. To satisfy this interference constraint, a secondary user (SU) employs a power control mechanism, which typically limits its transmission power and thus reduces substantially its performance. Moreover, the large number of users expected for next-generation networks brings dense interference to the secondary network and, as such, even efficient interference mitigation and resource allocation techniques can fail in maintaining an acceptable performance level for the network. In this work, we consider utilizing RA technology at SUs to act as an additional resource in terms of selecting antenna radiation patterns that improve received signal strength among SUs. This also limits the mutual interference between the secondary and primary networks. We propose a game theoretical framework for jointly selecting the subcarriers as well as the RA antenna state at each SU that maximizes the overall capacity of the network while meeting the interference target in the primary network. Using potential games that guarantee the existence of a Nash equilibrium, our results show that, by selecting the best RA state and subcarriers for each SU, the capacity of the secondary network increases substantially compared to a scenario with conventional omni-directional antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477088","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07244209.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"4015","endPage":"4025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Antenna State Selection for Cognitive Heterogeneous Networks With Reconfigurable Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Antenna State Selection for Cognitive Heterogeneous Networks With Reconfigurable Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244209/","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7244209/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676762","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"5-653-2-268"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Subcarrier and Antenna State Selection for Cognitive Heterogeneous Networks With Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yilmaz-2477088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098272S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7244209","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244213,"authors":[{"name":"J.

There are no direct transmission channels between any two users. Particularly, all users transmit their signals to all relays in the first time slot and M - 1 relays are selected later to broadcast their mixture signals during the following M - 1 time slots to all users. Compared to the transmission with the help of single relay, the multi-way relaying scenario reduces the transmit time significantly from 2M to M time slots. Random and semiorthogonal relays selections are applied. Rician fading channels are considered between the users and relays, and analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic sum rate for the proposed relaying protocol are developed by first characterizing the statistical property of the effective channel gain based on random relays selection. Also, the approximation of ergodic sum rate at high signal-to-noise ratio regime is derived. In addition, the diversity order of the system is investigated for both random and semiorthogonal relay selections. Meanwhile, it is shown that when the relays are randomly separated into L groups of M - 1 relays, the group with maximum average channel gain can achieve the diversity order L, which will increase when more relays considered in the scheme. Furthermore, when semiorthogonal selection (SS) algorithm is applied to select the relays with semiorthogonal channels, it is shown that the system will guarantee that all the users can decode the others information successfully. Moreover, the maximum of channel gain after semiorthogonal relays selection is investigated by using extreme value theory, and tight lower and upper bounds are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived expressions are accurate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Symmetric matrices","Rician channels","Simulation","Network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","multi-way relaying","Rician fading channels","direct transmission channels","relaying protocol","semiorthogonal selection algorithm","semiorthogonal channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication","extreme value theory","multi-way relaying","semiorthogonal relays selection"]},{"kwd":["Cooperative communication","extreme value theory","multi-way relaying","semiorthogonal relays selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07244213.pdf","startPage":"4050","endPage":"4062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis for Multi-Way Relaying in Rician Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for Multi-Way Relaying in Rician Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244213/","volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244213/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15676744","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/I037156/2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M014126/1"},{"fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis for Multi-Way Relaying in Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-xue-2477085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107925S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7244213","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7244216,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The proposed separation method is an online adaptive process and independent of parameters initialization. In this paper, a noisy pseudo-stereo mixing model is developed by formulating an artificial mixture from the observed mixture where the signals are modeled by the autoregressive process. The proposed demixing process composes of two steps: First, the noisy mixing model is enhanced by selecting the time-frequency (TF) units of signal presence and computing the mixture spectral amplitude, and second, an adaptive estimation of the parameters associated with each source is computed frame-by-frame, which is then used to construct a TF mask for the separation process. To assess the performance of the proposed method, noisy mixtures of real-audio sources with nonstationary noise have been conducted under various SNRs. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has yielded superior separation performance especially in low input SNR compared with existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244216/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15799033","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Online Noisy Single-Channel Source Separation Using Adaptive Spectrum Amplitude Estimator and Masking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Noisy Single-Channel Source Separation Using Adaptive Spectrum Amplitude Estimator and Masking","sourcePdf":"tsp-woo-2477059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092516S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7244216","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7244219,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Saber","affiliation":["Department of System and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7244219/saber-2477082-small.gif","p":["\nHamid Saber (S'12) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2010.

We show how the proposed extending algorithm, when properly operated with a good puncturing algorithm and a well-chosen puncturing rate, yields IR-HARQ coding schemes which can operate within 1 dB of Shannon capacity over a very wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07244219.pdf","startPage":"3964","endPage":"3973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ Scheme via Puncturing and Extending of Polar Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ Scheme via Puncturing and Extending of Polar Codes","volume":"63","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244219/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676719","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244219/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ Scheme via Puncturing and Extending of Polar Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-saber-2477082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082025S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7244219","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7244220,"authors":[{"name":"Sen Yan","affiliation":["ESAT-TELEMIC Research Division, Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7244220/seyan-2477094-small.gif","p":["Sen Yan was born in Xianyang, China.

The fundamental SIW cavity mode is designed to resonate at 2.4 GHz. Meanwhile, the second and third modes are modified and combined by careful placement of a via within the cavity to enable wideband coverage in the 5-GHz WLAN band. The simple antenna topology can be fabricated fully using textiles in a planar form, ensuring reliability and comfort. Numerical and experimental results indicate satisfactory antenna performance when worn on body in terms of impedance bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and specific absorption ratio (SAR). In order to validate its potential for MIMO applications, two elements of the proposed SIW antenna are arranged in six configurations to study the performance in terms of mutual coupling and envelope correlation. It is observed that the placement of the shorted edges of the two elements adjacent to each other produces the lowest mutual coupling and consequently the best envelope correlation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7312523/07244220.pdf","startPage":"4640","endPage":"4647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2477094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2477094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Band Textile MIMO Antenna Based on Substrate-Integrated Waveguide (SIW) Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Cavity resonators","Couplings","Textiles","MIMO","Substrates","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","multifrequency antennas","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-band textile MIMO antenna","substrate-integrated waveguide technology","multiple-input-multiple-output applications","5-GHz WLAN band","antenna topology","impedance bandwidth","radiation efficiency","specific absorption ratio","SAR","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wearable antenna","textile antenna","MIMO antenna","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna","dual-band antenna"]},{"kwd":["Dual-band antenna","MIMO antenna","substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna","textile antenna","wearable antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Band Textile MIMO Antenna Based on Substrate-Integrated Waveguide (SIW) Technology","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7244220/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568439","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Band Textile MIMO Antenna Based on Substrate-Integrated Waveguide (SIW) Technology","sourcePdf":"tap-yan-2477094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090998S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7312523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"7312523","articleId":"7244220","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7244223,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Rezaiesarlak","affiliation":["Motorola Mobility, Chicago, IL, USA","Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7244223/rezai-2477096-small.gif","p":["Reza Rezaiesarlak (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, the M.S. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in 2015, all in electrical engineering.","From 2008 to 2012, he was a Research Assistant with the Microwave Group, Shahid Beheshti University, where he worked on various active and passive microwave circuits and antennas.

In multiple resonant-based scatterers where the complex natural resonances (CNRs) are used as the ID of the target, the early-time response of the second scatterer might overlap with the late-time of the first, introducing some difficulties in the detection of the second scatterer and additionally, identification of the first one. In such circumstances, the separation of the late-time CNRs (ID of the scatterer) from the early-time poles (scattering centers) is challenging. The smaller the distance between two scatterers, the more difficult the detection process is. Here, by sliding a window along the time axis and applying short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM), the poles corresponding to the early-time and late-time responses are distinguished. It will be shown that when the early-time response is located at the center of the sliding window, its CNRs are located on the imaginary axis of the pole diagram. By monitoring the zero-crossing points in time damping-factor diagram, the locations of the early-time responses (or equivalently scattering centers) can be detected. Some scenarios are discussed, simulated, and confirmed by measurement results to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in practical applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244223/","accessionNumber":"15568476","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Extraction of Early-/Late-Time Responses Using Short-Time Matrix Pencil Method for Transient Analysis of Scatterers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Extraction of Early-/Late-Time Responses Using Short-Time Matrix Pencil Method for Transient Analysis of Scatterers","sourcePdf":"tap-manteghi-2477096-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062159S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7312523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7312523","articleId":"7244223","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7244226,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7313073/7244226/zhang-2477050-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the M.S. degree in statistics from the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in communications information system from the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, in 2013.

The messages intended to the ID user is required to be kept confidential to the EH user. Our objective is to design the optimal transmit covariance matrix at the BS for maximizing the ergodic secrecy rate subject to the harvested energy requirement for the EH user exploiting only statistical channel state information at the BS. To this end, we begin by deriving an approximation for the ergodic secrecy rate using large-dimensional random matrix theory and the method of Taylor series expansion. This approximation enables us to derive the asymptotic-optimal transmit covariance matrix that achieves the tradeoff for ergodic secrecy rate and harvested energy. The simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the approximation and show that a bigger rate-energy region can be achieved when the Rician factor increases or the path loss exponent decreases. We also show that when the transmit correlation increases or the distance between the eavesdropper and the BS decreases, the harvested energy will be increased, while the achieved ergodic secrecy rate decreases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large System Secrecy Rate Analysis for SWIPT MIMO Wiretap Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2477050","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7313073/07244226.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2477050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Large System Secrecy Rate Analysis for SWIPT MIMO Wiretap Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7244226/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568294","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271237 and 61427801"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Technology and Application of Internet of Things","grantNumber":"TJ213003"},{"fundingName":"Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Start-up Foundation (NUPTSF)","grantNumber":"NY215004"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation through the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"15KJB510025"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation Program through Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20150852"},{"fundingName":"iTrust"},{"fundingName":"Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan","grantNumber":"E352J33120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-110-029-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222102"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10300"},{"fundingName":"2015 ICC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large System Secrecy Rate Analysis for SWIPT MIMO Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhang-2477050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115566S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7313073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7313073","articleId":"7244226","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244232,"authors":[{"name":"Yuta Hori","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7244232/yhori-2477086-small.gif","p":["Yuta Hori (S\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication engineering from Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

BICM-OFDM systems are able to simplify the design of coding and modulation with various information rates for link adaptation. Furthermore, they provide robustness against frequency-selective fading channels. The combination of BICM-OFDM and convolutional code turns out to be attractive as it allows for low complexity and low latency decoding architecture at the receiver. It has been known that the performance of convolutionally coded BICM-OFDM systems depends on the bit interleaver structure, but little attention has been paid for its theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel theoretical expression for approximate BER of convolutionally coded BICM-OFDM that can be used for evaluating the performance of a given bit interleaver structure, and propose a design guideline for its optimization. Numerical comparisons between the optimized interleaver that satisfies our guideline and other random and structured interleavers demonstrate the validity of our design criterion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Interleaver Structure Optimization for Short-Frame BICM\u2013OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2477086","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07244232.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2477086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Interleaver Structure Optimization for Short-Frame BICM\u2013OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7244232/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697435","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme (SCOPE)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Interleaver Structure Optimization for Short-Frame BICM\u2013OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-hori-2477086-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07415S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7244232","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244234,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlei Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7605560/7244234/peng-2464681-small.gif","p":["Chunlei Peng received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and information engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in intelligent information processing with the VIPS Laboratory, School of Electronic Engineering.","His current research interests include computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Chunlei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085879272"},{"name":"Xinbo Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7605560/7244234/gao-2464681-small.gif","p":["Xinbo Gao (M\u201902\u2013SM\u201907) received the B.Eng., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1994, 1997, and 1999, respectively.","He was a Research Fellow with the Department of Computer Science, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan, from 1997 to 1998.

Most of the existing methods only use pixel intensities as the feature. Since face images can be described using features from multiple aspects, this paper presents a novel multiple representations-based face sketch-photo-synthesis method that adaptively combines multiple representations to represent an image patch. In particular, it combines multiple features from face images processed using multiple filters and deploys Markov networks to exploit the interacting relationships between the neighboring image patches. The proposed framework could be solved using an alternating optimization strategy and it normally converges in only five outer iterations in the experiments. Our experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) face sketch database, celebrity photos, CUHK Face Sketch FERET Database, IIIT-D Viewed Sketch Database, and forensic sketches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for face sketch-photo synthesis. In addition, cross-database and database-dependent style-synthesis evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of this novel method and suggest promising solutions for face identification in forensic science.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7605560/07244234.pdf","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2464681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2464681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605560","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Representations-Based Face Sketch\u2013Photo Synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Training","Markov random fields","Optimization","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital forensics","face recognition","image filtering","image representation","Markov processes","optimisation","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple representation-based face sketch-photo synthesis","law enforcement","digital entertainment","pixel intensities","face images","multiple filters","Markov networks","neighboring image patches","optimization","Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database","CUHK face sketch FERET database","celebrity photos","IIIT-D viewed sketch database","forensic sketches","cross-database","database-dependent style-synthesis","face identification","forensic science"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","face sketch\u2013photo synthesis","forensic sketch","multiple representations"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Representations-Based Face Sketch\u2013Photo Synthesis","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7244234/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397052","pubMedId":"26357409","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125204, 61172146, 61432014 and 61501339"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB149901 and XJS15049"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of China","grantNumber":"IRT13088"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Innovative Research Team for Key Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005151","fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZDEW-T03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Projects","grantNumber":"FT-130101457, DP-140102164 and LP-140100569"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Representations-Based Face Sketch\u2013Photo Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2464681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152336S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7605560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7605560","articleId":"7244234","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244236,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Jen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7244236/chen-2469132-small.gif","p":["Liang-Jen Chen was born in Taiwan in 1985.

In IO-CA, each MNO can transmit on its own licensed spectrum and aggregate the spectrum licensed to other MNOs. We focus on the case that MNOs are partitioned and distributed into small groups, called IO-CA pairs, each of which consists of two MNOs that mutually agree to share their spectrum with each other. We model the IO-CA pairing problem between MNOs as a stable roommate market and derive a condition for which a stable matching structure among all MNOs exist. We propose an algorithm that achieves a stable matching if it exists. Otherwise, the algorithm results in a stable partition. For each IO-CA pair, we derive the optimal transmit power for each spectrum aggregator and establish a Stackelberg game model to analyze the interaction between the licensed subscribers and aggregators in the spectrum of each MNO. We derive the Stackelberg equilibrium of our proposed game and then develop a joint optimization algorithm that achieves the stable matching structure among MNOs as well as the optimal transmit powers for the aggregators and prices for the subscribers of each MNO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697426","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7244237/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Carrier Aggregation Between Operators in Next Generation Cellular Networks: A Stable Roommate Market","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121, CNS-1265268 and CNS-0953377"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"10/IN.1/I3007"},{"fundingName":"A*Star SERC","grantNumber":"142 02 00043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Aggregation Between Operators in Next Generation Cellular Networks: A Stable Roommate Market","sourcePdf":"twc-xiao-2477077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117547S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7244237","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7244241,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7244241/7244241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhao received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2012, and is currently working toward the M.E. degree in computer technology engineering at Tianjin University.","His current research interests include pattern recognition, machine learning, neural networks, and computer vision."]},"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085647927"},{"name":"Qinghua Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7244241/7244241-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Qinghua Hu (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1999, 2002, and 2008, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, from 2009 to 2011.

The multi-modal, often also high- dimensional , features may contain redundant and irrelevant information that can deteriorate the performance of modeling in classification. It is a challenging problem to select the informative features for a given task from the redundant and heterogeneous feature groups. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address this problem. This framework is composed of two modules, namely, multi-modal deep neural networks and feature selection with sparse group LASSO. Given diverse groups of discriminative features, the proposed technique first converts the multi-modal data into a unified representation with different branches of the multi-modal deep neural networks. Then, through solving a sparse group LASSO problem, the feature selection component is used to derive a weight vector to indicate the importance of the feature groups. Finally, the feature groups with large weights are considered more relevant and hence are selected. We evaluate our framework on three image classification datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in selecting the relevant feature groups and achieves competitive classification performance as compared with several recent baseline methods.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7302100/07244241.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Feature Selection With Multi-Modal Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Group LASSO","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2477058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2477058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Feature Selection With Multi-Modal Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Group LASSO","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553470","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7244241/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB329304"},{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"61222210 and 61432011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Feature Selection With Multi-Modal Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Group LASSO","sourcePdf":"tmm-hu-2477058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109025S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7244241","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7244243,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290251100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7244243","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constellation diagram","Indexes","Resource management","Binary phase shift keying","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","antenna arrays","communication complexity","Gaussian channels","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer simulations","multiantenna transmission","multicarrier transmission","minimum squared Euclidean distance","signal constellations","index modulation pattern","transmitter","finite alphabet inputs","parallel Gaussian channels","adaptive index modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","finite alphabet input","index modulation (IM)","parallel channel","spatial modulation (SM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we extend the concept of adaptive spatial modulation to the parallel Gaussian channel with finite alphabet input and propose a transmit scheme called adaptive index modulation (AIM). In the proposed scheme, the transmitter adaptively selects the index modulation pattern, consisting of the active channel subset and the associated signal constellations, according to the criterion of maximizing the minimum squared Euclidean distance. To reduce the complexity, first, the number of candidate patterns in the selection procedure is reduced by employing the relation of the normalized signal constellations with different modulation orders. Second, a simple lookup table method is presented.

A novel hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper that determines Pareto frontiers, as the candidate solutions, for multiobjective distribution network reconfiguration problem. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm combines the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance with shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to recognize optimal nondominated solutions identified by SFLA. The local search step of SFLA is also customized for power systems application so that it automatically creates and analyzes only the feasible and radial configurations in its optimization procedure, which significantly increases the convergence speed of the algorithm. Moreover, an adaptive reliability-based frog encoding is introduced that supervises the algorithm to concentrate on more reliable network topologies. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a 136-bus electricity distribution network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto Dominance-Based Multiobjective Optimization Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2468683","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7456360/07244245.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2468683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Pareto Dominance-Based Multiobjective Optimization Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7244245/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15934857","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto Dominance-Based Multiobjective Optimization Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","sourcePdf":"tsg-lotfifard-2468683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09502S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7456360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7456360","articleId":"7244245","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244249,"authors":[{"name":"Branka Jokanovic","affiliation":["Villanova University, Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7244249/7244249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Branka Jokanovic (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

Then, the improved control method for bidirectional converters in hybrid microgrid operated in island mode is presented to reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation, which includes the droop controller used to achieve automatic power sharing and the improved virtual impedance controller used to further reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation. At last, simulation and experiment results verified that the proposed control method can simultaneously achieve circulating current reduction and automatic power sharing, and does not decrease the output power capability of converter.

The algorithm is based on the method of matrix exponential learning (MXL) and it has the same information and computation requirements as distributed water-filling. However, unlike water-filling, the proposed algorithm converges to the system's optimum signal covariance profile even under stochastic uncertainty and imperfect feedback. Moreover, the algorithm also retains its convergence properties in the presence of user update asynchronicities, random delays and/or ergodically changing channel conditions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive numerical simulations which illustrate the robustness and scalability of MXL in realistic network conditions. In particular, the algorithm retains its convergence speed even for large numbers of users and/or antennas per user.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2477053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07244254.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2477053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in an Uncertain World: MIMO Covariance Matrix Optimization With Imperfect Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244254/","displayDocTitle":"Learning in an Uncertain World: MIMO Covariance Matrix Optimization With Imperfect Feedback","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15647661","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244254/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in an Uncertain World: MIMO Covariance Matrix Optimization With Imperfect Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-mertikopoulos-2477053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132548S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7244254","onlineDate":"07 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244257,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Fan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7244257/7244257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meng-Fan Chang (M\u201905\u2013SM\u201914) received the M.S. degree from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, respectively.","From 1996 to 1997, he designed memory compilers in Mentor Graphics, New Jersey, USA.

The relationship of the carrier-to-sideband ratio (CSR) and guard band (GB) to the signal-to-signal beat interference (SSBI) is explored. According to our theoretical analysis, the degradation caused by SSBI on the SSB-OOFDM signal becomes worse as the GB reduces, whereas the increase in the CSR can loosen this degradation. Therefore, a tradeoff between the GB and CSR balances their joint influence on system performance. The simulation for the 20-km optical link with 40-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) noised SSB-OOFDM signal is conducted to confirm our theoretical results. It shows that, without any complex device or algorithm, the GB can be reduced to 40% only by increasing the CSR to ~8 dB, and thus, the spectral efficiency of the DDO-OFDM link is improved after optimizing the CSR and GB of the SSB-OOFDM signal. In addition, the influence of the optical signal-to-noise ratio and the electronic filter on the optimum CSR of the system is further analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2470130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7222813/07244281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2470130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222813","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Influence of the Optical Carrier-to-Sideband Ratio and Guard Band on Direct-Detection SSB-OOFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Influence of the Optical Carrier-to-Sideband Ratio and Guard Band on Direct-Detection SSB-OOFDM System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7801713","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15430962","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7244281/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Influence of the Optical Carrier-to-Sideband Ratio and Guard Band on Direct-Detection SSB-OOFDM System","sourcePdf":"jphot-ma-2470130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067851S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7244281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244334,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos V.

The proposed CT SMASH architecture has a much wider signal bandwidth which was limited in the discrete-time (DT) SMASH architecture due to the inherent sampling frequency limitation of DT implementation. Furthermore, the proposed CT SMASH architecture provides better quantization noise suppression by more completely canceling the quantization noise from the 1st-loop. The CT SMASH architecture is implemented with several efficient circuit techniques suitable for high operation speed.

We take a population game approach, which allows tractable analysis of many selfish mobiles without growing mathematical complexity. From our game-theoretical analysis, we prove that a simple power-dependent pricing by operators leads a Nash equilibrium to be equal to the optimal solution of a social optimization problem (i.e., no price-of-anarchy). We study three evolution dynamics of associating MSs, each expressed as a differential equation, all of which provably and/or numerically converge to the Nash equilibrium. Based on several considerations regarding implementation of association algorithms in practice, we found that asynchronicity and fast load tracking are the key components to practical algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose a practical energy-efficient user association mechanism, named BRUTE. To evaluate the performance of BRUTE, we implement a cellular network simulator using an event-driven simulator, SimPy, and perform extensive simulations under various scenarios including a real BS topology in U.K. Our simulation results show that BRUTE outperforms other conventional user association techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Sociology","Statistics","Heuristic algorithms","Wireless communication","Nash equilibrium","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","evolutionary computation","game theory","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile stations","base stations","population game approach","selfish mobiles","power-dependent pricing","Nash equilibrium","social optimization problem","evolution dynamics","asynchronicity","fast load tracking","energy-efficient user association mechanism","BRUTE","cellular network simulator","event-driven simulator","SimPy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User association","population game","evolutionary dynamics","load balancing","cellular networks"]},{"kwd":["User association","population game","evolutionary dynamics","load balancing","cellular networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2477297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07244342.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2477297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BRUTE: Energy-Efficient User Association in Cellular Networks From Population Game Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BRUTE: Energy-Efficient User Association in Cellular Networks From Population Game Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244342/","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244342/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697429","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A2A2A01067633"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP)","grantNumber":"B0126-15-1078"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004083","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A1006551"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BRUTE: Energy-Efficient User Association in Cellular Networks From Population Game Perspective","sourcePdf":"twc-yi-2477297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098307S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7244342","onlineDate":"08 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244345,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7244345/he-2477248-small.gif","p":["\n\nShiwen He (M'14) received the M.S. degree from Chengdu University of \nTechnology, Chengdu, China, in 2009 and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast \nUniversity, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio \nEngineering, Southeast University.

However, how to achieve balance between SE and EE for a multicell multiuser coordinated beamforming system remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for EE-SE balancing, namely, using a new metric called resource efficiency (RE) as the objective function to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between SE and EE. The considered optimization problem is more complex than traditional problems and, in general, is NP-hard for finding the globally optimal solution. To obtain insight into the problem, we first equivalently transform the original problem into a parameterized subtractive form optimization problem with some auxiliary variables by using the fraction programming theory. Then, a successive convex approximation method and the classical second-order cone programming method are jointly used to solve the equivalent problem. Finally, an effective algorithm with proven convergence is proposed to obtain the solution to the considered RE optimization. In addition, the algorithm is further extended to consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) using the worst-case design. Extensive numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16210053","htmlLink":"/document/7244345/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Efficiency: A New Beamforming Design for Multicell Multiuser Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A703"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471120, 61422105, 61302097 and 61372101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20130019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Efficiency: A New Beamforming Design for Multicell Multiuser Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2477248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116814S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7244345","onlineDate":"08 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7244347,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Schraml","affiliation":["Department of Digital Safety and Security, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7352402/7244347/schra-2477265-small.gif","p":["Stephan Schraml received the Master's degree in computer science from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 2005.

The main contribution is a novel event-driven stereo approach enabling 3-D 360\u00b0 high-dynamic-range panoramic vision for real-time application in a natural environment. This approach makes use of a sparse visual code generated by a rotating pair of dynamic vision line sensors. The use of this system allows panoramic images to be generated by the transformation of events, eliminating the need to capture a large set of images. It thereby increases the acquisition speed, which improves accuracy in dynamic scenes. This paper focuses on its 3-D reconstruction and performance analysis using such a rotating multiperspective vision system. First, a theoretical analysis of the stereo matching accuracy is performed. Second, a depth error formulation is developed, which takes motion into consideration and reveals the leverage of scene dynamics on depth estimation. In this paper, disparity is measured in time units, which allows accurate depth maps to be estimated from a moving sensor system. Third, a stereo matching workflow is presented using standard stereo image matching to assess the 3-D reconstruction accuracy. Finally, experimental results are reported on real-world sensor data, showing that the system allows for the 3-D reconstruction of high-resolution round views even under challenging illumination conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7352402/07244347.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244347/","displayDocTitle":"An Event-Driven Stereo System for Real-Time 3-D 360\u00b0 Panoramic Vision","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244347/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency","grantNumber":"835925"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Event-Driven Stereo System for Real-Time 3-D 360\u00b0 Panoramic Vision","sourcePdf":"tie-schraml-2477265-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071545S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7244347","onlineDate":"08 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7244348,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomeng Chai","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8323440/7244348/xiaom-2470556-small.gif","p":["Xiaomeng Chai (S'15) received the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Institute of Advanced Network Technologies and New Services.","His current research interests include heterogeneous networks, self-organization network, and resource allocation optimization."]},"firstName":"Xiaomeng","lastName":"Chai","id":"37085382287"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8323440/7244348/zhang-2470556-small.gif","p":["Zhongshan Zhang (M'04) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in computer science and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1998, 2001, and 2004, respectively.","In August 2004, he joined DoCoMo Beijing Laboratories as an Associate Researcher, where he was promoted as a Researcher in December 2005.

Precoding is paramount to achieve downlink MU-MIMO capacity. Tomlinson Harashima Precoding (THP) can eliminate inter user interference (IUI) and inter antenna interference (IAI) to achieve lower bit error rate (BER). THP first decompose MU-MIMO into single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) blocks then further decompose into independent single-input single-output (SISO) channels. THP limits the transmitter power to avoid high instantaneous peak transmit power and achieve performance close to Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) but with much lower complexity. User scheduling for transmission select favorable channels to maximize sum rate. Our proposed THP decomposition method with user scheduling outperforms the existing Block Diagonalization (BD) schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244433","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244433.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO precoding and user scheduling for mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO precoding and user scheduling for mobile communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244433/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436454","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244433/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO precoding and user scheduling for mobile communications","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570062601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100904S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244440,"authors":[{"name":"Mengxue Hou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mengxue","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085654138"},{"name":"Shangtai Jin","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Lab., Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangtai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402487100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active disturbance rejection control","adaptive control","discrete systems","manipulators","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven control methods","planar manipulator","online DDC methods","model free adaptive control","MFAC","mathematical model","controlled plant","active disturbance rejection control","ADRC","1 rotary joint","PM1R","MATLAB platform","nonlinear model","discrete control laws"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven control","Model free adaptive control","Model free control","Active rejection disturbance control","Nonlinear system","Dynamic linearization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244440","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation comparison among three data-driven control methods for the planar manipulator","abstract":"Data-driven control (DDC) is very suitable for practical industrial processes and has attracted much attention of researchers and engineers because it does not depend on an accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant.

Massive MIMO has been identified as a promising technology that offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in spectral-efficiency over 4G technologies. However, one of the major limiting factors is pilot contamination when TDD protocol is considered. Different methods have been proposed in literature to mitigate effect of pilot contamination in multi-cellular systems. This paper provides an overview of the proposed approaches in mitigating the effect of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems. First, we classify the methods proposed under two categories: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. We examine the problems of pilot contamination and open issues are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244441.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating pilot contamination in massive MIMO system \u2014 5G: An overview","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contamination","MIMO","Channel estimation","Interference","Uplink","Antennas","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","access protocols","Internet of Things","MIMO communication","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot contamination mitigation","massive MIMO system","5G future generation cellular networks","Internet of Things","machine-to-machine communication","TDD protocol","multicellular systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G network","channel state information (CSI)","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","pilot contamination","time-division duplex system (TDD)","pilot-based approach","subspace-based approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating pilot contamination in massive MIMO system \u2014 5G: An overview","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436653","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating pilot contamination in massive MIMO system \u2014 5G: An overview","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570063957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11481S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244469,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Bai","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, P.R.

Equity is one of its most important constraints with the aim to ensure the value of one or several interesting spatial attributes at a certain level and to provide solutions to specific requirements in applications. This paper tackles a new regionalization scenario in which the threshold used in equity constraint is a regional mean measurement and depends on an unknown amount of regions. A novel nonlinear mixed integer programming model is developed. For the solution of the model a parallel genetic algorithm capable of solving large-scale, real-world instances, is designed. Our efforts in designing a genetic algorithm that integrates an upper bound heuristic are reported. A group of 30 synthetic lattice data is generated according to the spatial auto regressive function to evaluate the proposed genetic algorithm. Equity attributes with both Uniform distribution and Poisson distribution are considered to make a comparison. This work makes an original contribution in the solution of the regionalization problem with adaptive equity constraint.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244475","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm for regionalization problem with adaptive equity constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for regionalization problem with adaptive equity constraint","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15436561","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244475/","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for regionalization problem with adaptive equity constraint","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570070941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083311S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244481,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A.

The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244503","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an optimal sliding surface for 2-DOF Twin Rotor MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244503/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an optimal sliding surface for 2-DOF Twin Rotor MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436429","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244503/","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an optimal sliding surface for 2-DOF Twin Rotor MIMO system","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570072981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074698S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244530,"authors":[{"name":"Haruhiro Inukai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Kita-ku, Okayama-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhiro","lastName":"Inukai","id":"37085633292"},{"name":"Mamoru Minami","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Kita-ku, Okayama-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Minami","id":"37280393200"},{"name":"Akira Yanou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Kita-ku, Okayama-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yanou","id":"37277313200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244530","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244530","abstract":"We have been investigating a method to compose some intelligent robot. Continuous catching and releasing experiment of several fishes induces the fishes to find some escaping strategies such as staying stationarily at corners of the pool. To make fish-catching robot intelligent more than fish's adapting and escaping abilities, we have proposed a chaos-generator comprising Neural-Network-Differential-Equation(NNDE) and an evolving mechanism to have the system generate chaotic trajectories as many as possible. We believe that the fish could not be adaptive enough to escape from chasing net with chaos motions since unpredictable chaotic motions of net may go beyond the fish's adapting abilities to the net motions. In this report we confirmed that the proposed system can generate plural chaos by examining chaotic characters of chaos trajectories generated by NNDE through Lyapunov number, Poincare return map, initial value sensitivity, fractal dimension and bifurcation map.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244530","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating chaos with neural-network-differential-equation for intelligent fish-catching robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Trajectory","Robots","Sensitivity","Fractals","Bifurcation","Marine animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent robots","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-differential-equation","intelligent fish-catching robot","NNDE","chaotic trajectories","Lyapunov number","Poincare return map","initial value sensitivity","fractal dimension","bifurcation map"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generating chaos with neural-network-differential-equation for intelligent fish-catching robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15436544","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating chaos with neural-network-differential-equation for intelligent fish-catching robot","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570073639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071417S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244536,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In this work, the problem with a primary instrument was analysed to diagnose the faulty condition of measurement in metering station. Accordingly, different ANN algorithms were investigated and compared to select a prediction model that provides the best performance. This suggested prediction technique can be considered as an additional verification system to be compared to the hard instrument that is installed on the pipeline. Hence, in order to determine accuracy in the rate of measurement from the proposed model, it is required that variation in measurement between hard and soft instrument should not exceed 1%.

An optimization algorithm is designed to minimize the time consuming to get the best parameter. To design an optimal method, Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is utilized to optimize the CNF controller performance. Those parameters will be optimized based on the time response specifications namely overshoot, settling time and steady state error in solving the minimization problem. By the implementation of multi-objective approach, all of these criteria can be computed together in one optimization algorithm by using linear weight summation. The application of this investigation is implemented on active front steering system (AFS) system. The important vehicle parameter that must be controlled in AFS is yaw rate response. However, the response of the yaw rate needs to follow the desired yaw rate reference to achieve a good handling performance. Thus, by the implementation of CNF with MOGA in AFS system, the yaw rate response is improved and able to track the desired reference response.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244544","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244544.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal composite nonlinear feedback with multi-objective genetic algorithm for active front steering system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Wheels","Mathematical model","Tires","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","feedback","genetic algorithms","linear systems","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","parameter estimation","road vehicles","steering systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal composite nonlinear feedback controller design","multiobjective genetic algorithm","active front steering system","CNF controller","parameter estimation","linear feedback gain","nonlinear gain parameters","optimization algorithm","MOGA","time response specifications","overshoot","settling time","steady state error","minimization problem","linear weight summation","AFS system","yaw rate response","yaw rate reference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["composite nonlinear feedback","controller","multi-objective approach","genetic algorithm","optimal control","linear feedback gain","nonlinear gain","active front steering vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal composite nonlinear feedback with multi-objective genetic algorithm for active front steering system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244544/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15436701","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal composite nonlinear feedback with multi-objective genetic algorithm for active front steering system","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570073821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071097S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244567,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of nonlinear optimization which has a good potential to be implemented in the NMPC. Even though PSO can determine global optimum value, it is less superior in determining a local minimum value. Meanwhile, another optimizer known as simulated annealing (SA), has an opposite capability of PSO in determining the local and global values. Consequently, in this work, the SA and PSO optimizers have been combined to form SA-PSO which expected to cater both local and optimum point searching. From the particle distribution study, the result shows that the SA-PSO has better particle distribution than the original PSO. The proposed SA-PSO optimizer has also successfully applied in NMPC to control temperatures in the MTBE reactive distillation. The set point tracking test show that the NMPC using SA-PSO have good performance with small amount of overshoot, low settling time and small amount of error.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244567","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244567.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated annealing-Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO): Particle distribution study and application in Neural Wiener-based NMPC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244567/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulated annealing-Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO): Particle distribution study and application in Neural Wiener-based NMPC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244567/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15436628","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated annealing-Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO): Particle distribution study and application in Neural Wiener-based NMPC","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570074439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06065S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7244580,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Karungaru","affiliation":["Dept.

The planar electromagnetic sensor array has been subjected to different water samples contaminated by nitrate and phosphate where output signals have been extracted.

The energy and mean features of decomposed signals were extracted and used as inputs for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks models. The analysis models were targeted to classify the amount of nitrate and phosphate contamination in water supply. The result shows that the planar electromagnetic sensor array with the assistance of the MLP neural network method is the best alternative as compared to RBF neural network method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244593/","accessionNumber":"15436650","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons between radial basis function and multilayer perceptron neural networks methods for nitrate and phosphate detections in water supply","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons between radial basis function and multilayer perceptron neural networks methods for nitrate and phosphate detections in water supply","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570074589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.185183S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244612,"authors":[{"name":"Shin Wakitani","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin","lastName":"Wakitani","id":"37085406125"},{"name":"Mingcong Deng","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mingcong","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271139500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244612","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Control systems","Databases","Joints","Instruments","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven expert controller design","expert adaptive controller design method","local proposal-integral-derivative controller","skill-based PID controller","evaluation scores","data vectors","neighbor data","social problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244612","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244612.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a data-driven expert controller","abstract":"This paper proposes a design method for an expert adaptive controller that stores operating data from experts in a database and designs a local proposal-integral-derivative (PID) controller at each step by referencing applicable data from this database. In recent years, the retirements of senior experts have created a serious social problem owing to the loss of their expertise. A skill-based PID controller has been proposed to solve this problem. However, the method uses only one expert's skills. According to the proposed method, data vectors that are composed of a number of experts' skills and evaluation scores are stored in a database. Data vectors that are close to a query are designated as neighbor data; a local PID controller is designed by using these neighbor data. Data vectors including low evaluation scores are excluded from the neighbor data by adding evaluation scores to their distances. Thus, the controller is designed by using neighbor data that include high evaluation scores, so that superior control can be obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by a simulated example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244612/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436839","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a data-driven expert controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a data-driven expert controller","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570074699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044164S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244686,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It minimizes the steady-state tracking error, increases the closed-loop bandwidth, and enables the controller to track a reference signal, the major requirements for nanopositioning applications. These capabilities of MPC controllers have motivated this research to improve the positioning performance of the piezoelectric tube scanner (PTS) for better imaging performance of an atomic force microscope (AFM). The multi-input multi-output (MIMO) form of the controller designed in this work compensates for the cross-coupling effect while the damping compensator augmented with the plant enhances its damping capability. To evaluate the performance improvement using the proposed control frame work, an experimental comparison with the existing AFM proportional-integral (PI) controller is conducted which demonstrates that it enhances image quality for scanning speeds up to 125 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244686","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244686.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanopositioning performance of MIMO MPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244686/","displayDocTitle":"Nanopositioning performance of MIMO MPC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436546","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244686/","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanopositioning performance of MIMO MPC","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570075169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055838S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244690,"authors":[{"name":"Zakariah Yusuf","affiliation":["Control & Mechatronics Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, johor"],"firstName":"Zakariah","lastName":"Yusuf","id":"37397848900"},{"name":"Norhaliza Abdul Wahab","affiliation":["Control & Mechatronics Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, johor"],"firstName":"Norhaliza Abdul","lastName":"Wahab","id":"37529767900"},{"name":"Mohd Hakim Abd Halim","affiliation":["Institute of Environment and Water Resources Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Hakim Abd","lastName":"Halim","id":"37085659334"},{"name":"Aznah Nor Anuar","affiliation":["Institute of Environment and Water Resources Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"],"firstName":"Aznah Nor","lastName":"Anuar","id":"38075015900"},{"name":"Zaini Ujang","affiliation":["Institute of Environment and Water Resources Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zaini","lastName":"Ujang","id":"37085662069"},{"name":"Mustafa Bob","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Taibah University, Madinah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Bob","id":"37085678129"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244690","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Testing","Mathematical model","Optimization","Neural networks","Effluents","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","mean square error methods","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","sludge treatment","wastewater treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SBR aerobic granular sludge modeling","IW-PSO","modeling technique","sequential batch reactor","AGS","artificial neural network","ANN","synthetic wastewater","organics removal","nutrients removal","feed forward neural network","FFNN","inertia weight particle swarm optimization","gravitational search algorithm","neural network weights","neural network biases","GSA-NN","inertia weight PSO","root mean square error","RMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SBR","Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS)","Neural Network","Gravitational search algorithm (GSA)","Inertia weight PSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244690","abstract":"This paper presents a modeling technique of sequential batch reactor (SBR) for aerobic granular sludge (AGS) using artificial neural network (ANN).

Undersome assumptions, the properties of a system can be simply and visually behaved by the construction of input-output Hankel matrix. The row size of the Hankel matrix depends on the request of system excitation, which also determines the prediction and control horizons. In order to show the required order and thus help to choose the number size of the manipulated parameters, the Hankel matrix is reduced based on orthogonal projection. Thus, the prediction is accomplished using the latent space projection of a vector of inputs onto the outputs plan, serving exactly the similar role as order reduction of state estimators. Based on the prediction, MPC formulations and optimization are presented. For the unconstrained case, the control law is analytically determined direct from the data Hankel matrices, avoiding model identification or any intermediate step to meet the given performance specifications. Additionally, integrator action is added to the controller to obtain offset-free tracking.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244723","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244723.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven predictive controller design based on reduced Hankel matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven predictive controller design based on reduced Hankel matrix","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436503","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244723/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven predictive controller design based on reduced Hankel matrix","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570075399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078592S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7244733,"authors":[{"name":"Jimoh O.

Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the validity of our proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244744/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436639","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The canonical controller approach to data-driven update of state feedback gain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The canonical controller approach to data-driven update of state feedback gain","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570075547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069281S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7244760,"authors":[{"name":"Amira Sarayati Ahmad Dahalan","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Amira Sarayati Ahmad","lastName":"Dahalan","id":"37087207726"},{"name":"Abdul Rashid Husaint","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Abdul Rashid","lastName":"Husaint","id":"37087209874"},{"name":"Mohd Badril NorShah","affiliation":["Department of Control and Mechatronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Badril","lastName":"NorShah","id":"37085723822"},{"name":"Muhammad Iqbal Zakaria","affiliation":["Department of Control and Mechatronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Iqbal","lastName":"Zakaria","id":"37085727604"},{"name":"Muhammad Nizam Kamarudin","affiliation":["Department of Control and Mechatronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Nizam","lastName":"Kamarudin","id":"37719009000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244760","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","controller area networks","delays","networked control systems","PD control","robots","scheduling","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAN based dynamical system","maximum allowable loop delay","MALD","data sampling time with offset scheduling","networked dynamic system","DSTOS algorithm calculation","controller area network","multiple control loops","Matlab/Simulink","MALD selection","networked control system","closed loop system","SCARA robot","data latency","sensor","actuator","integral square error","IAE","link angle","control loops","data traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked control system (NCS) Data sampling time with offset scheduling (DSTOS)","Maximum allowable loop delay (MALD)","Controller Area Network (CAN)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244760","abstract":"This paper addresses the method to obtain maximum allowable loop delay (MALD) for calculation of data sampling time with offset scheduling (DSTOS) for networked dynamic system with multiple control loops via controller area network (CAN). The DSTOS algorithm calculation is based on MALD that is obtained by simulation means in Matlab/SimuUnk. The step-by-step of MALD selection based simulation is presented. A networked control system of direct-drive 2-DOF SCARA Robot is developed based on CAN where PD controller is adapted to form the closed loop system. The simulation is performed by using Matiab/Simulink-based TrueTime Toolbox and the implementation of DSTOS for three SCARA robot via CAN is analysed in event of the data latency of control data from sensor to actuator and the performance index, integral square error (IAE) of the link angle. The results and analysis show that the proper selection of sampling time for each control loops can optimize the data traffic and achieve effective utilization of the network bandwidth. It can be deduced that the good control performance can be achieved under proper selecting of MALD and optimal sampling time to the dynamic of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244760","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244760.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling time scheduling for a CAN-based dynamical system: A simulation practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sampling time scheduling for a CAN-based dynamical system: A simulation practice","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244760/","accessionNumber":"15436904","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244760/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling time scheduling for a CAN-based dynamical system: A simulation practice","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570075827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062929S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7244805,"authors":[{"name":"Changhui Hu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Changhui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085484931"},{"name":"Xiaobo Lu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Lu","id":"37538346800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244805","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Face","Face recognition","Databases","Image reconstruction","Training","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image reconstruction","image sampling","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single sample face recognition","lower-upper decomposition","LU decomposition algorithm","approximation image reconstruction","basis image set","experimental estimation method","Fisher linear discriminant analysis","FLDA","optimal projection space","FERET face database","AR face database","single sample per person problem","matrix factorization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new single sample face recognition approach based on lower-upper (LU) decomposition is proposed. The single sample and its transpose are decomposed to two sets of basis images respectively by LU decomposition algorithm. Two approximation images are reconstructed from the two basis image sets respectively by the experimental estimation method. The fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) is used to evaluate the optimal projection space using the new training set consisting of the single sample and its two approximation images for each person. We make two main contributions: one is that we propose to decompose the single sample and its transpose using the efficient LU decomposition algorithm; the other is that we present an experimental estimation method using the fixed image size to evaluate the number of basis images, which are used to reconstruct the approximation image. The experimental results on the FERET and AR face databases indicate that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches which are proposed to address the single sample per person problem.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244805","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244805.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single sample face recognition via lower-upper decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244805/","displayDocTitle":"Single sample face recognition via lower-upper decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436686","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244805/","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single sample face recognition via lower-upper decomposition","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570081677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100789S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244837,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Bazli M.

In any scene captured by surveillance camera, there could be single or multiple persons (agents) and activities ongoing concurrently, with or without human-object and/or human-human interactions. These characteristics lead to a very interesting problem, which involves techniques and insights from a number of domains-anomaly detection, activity recognition, sequence modeling, and deep learning. First, we need to know how to represent video frames as a set of features, then model the temporal sequence and the spatio-temporal relations in the sequence, followed by training the system using some machine learning algorithm on the training set of sequences. The trained system would be able to tell when there is an anomaly in the input stream. However, this is very challenging due to large variations in environment and human movement, and also due to the vague definition of anomaly in the domain of video surveillance. In this paper, we would like to give informational insights on how techniques from the four domains above can be applied to perform video-based anomaly detection.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244871","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling video-based anomaly detection using deep architectures: Challenges and possibilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling video-based anomaly detection using deep architectures: Challenges and possibilities","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244871/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436539","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7244871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling video-based anomaly detection using deep architectures: Challenges and possibilities","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570082881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156855S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244891,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Zhu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38466553400"},{"name":"Feng Qian","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Qian","id":"37275364600"},{"name":"Zhongsheng Hou","affiliation":["Advanced Control System Laboratory, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongsheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945500"},{"name":"Shangtai Jin","affiliation":["Advanced Control System Laboratory, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangtai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402487100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244891","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interconnected systems","Stability analysis","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Decentralized control","Data models","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","decentralised control","discrete time systems","interconnected systems","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven model free adaptive control","MFAC method","interconnected discrete-time nonlinear system","closed-loop system stability","decentralized control method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven Control","Model Free Adaptive Control","Interconnected System"]}],"abstract":"This paper recalls a novel data-driven model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method for a class of interconnected discrete-time nonlinear systems, whose model is unavailable and interactions between each subsystem are measurable.

Along with the spectrum scarcity problem, radio spectrums are also under utilized. Cognitive radio practices an open spectrum allocation technique, which can make sure efficient handling of the frequency bands. Suitable network is a must for the implementation of cognitive radio networks. This paper presents a novel node-joining algorithm for spectrum aware cluster-based cognitive radio ad-hoc network architecture. The spectrum aware architecture splits the network into groups of clusters where the spatial variations of spectrum availability are considered for clustering. Set of free common channels resides every cluster for smooth shifting among control channels. To maintain the integrity of the clustering method, node-joining protocol is developed. Conclusively, simulation is conducted and the result is presented to evaluate the performance of the protocol.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244895","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209153/7244373/07244895.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244895","publicationTitle":"2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel node joining alogoritm for spectrum aware cluster-based cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel node joining alogoritm for spectrum aware cluster-based cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7244895/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7244895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15436833","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel node joining alogoritm for spectrum aware cluster-based cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570083973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080654S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209153","isNumber":"7244373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7244373","articleId":"7244895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7244959,"authors":[{"name":"Kadda Beghdad Bey","affiliation":["Laboratory of Informatics Systems, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Kadda","lastName":"Beghdad Bey","id":"37586736200"},{"name":"Farid Benhammadi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Informatics Systems, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Benhammadi","id":"37297697400"},{"name":"R\u00e9dha Benaissa","affiliation":["Laboratory of Informatics Systems, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"R\u00e9dha","lastName":"Benaissa","id":"37085624195"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7699-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7698-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7244959","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing heuristic for independent task scheduling in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7244959","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Processor scheduling","Scheduling","Servers","Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","distributed processing","minimisation","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task scheduling","cloud computing","distributed computing","resource allocation","NP-complete problem","min-min algorithm","independent job scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scheduling algorithms","distributed computing","cloud computing","job scheduling","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Distributed computing environment has become a new technology to execute large-scale applications and Cloud computing is one of these technologies.

It is a constructive model without prior conditions such as a suitable number of neurons. A new neuron is inserted when new data are not represented by existing neurons.

As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to predict the health condition of a gas turbine engine when it is affected by degradation damage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245020/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15436994","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7245020/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid prognosis and health monitoring strategy by integrating particle filters and neural networks for gas turbine engines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid prognosis and health monitoring strategy by integrating particle filters and neural networks for gas turbine engines","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"PHM201512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099455S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222493","isNumber":"7245009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222493","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7245009","articleId":"7245020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245040,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal Khan","affiliation":["Integrated Vehicle Health Management Centre, Cranfield University, UK"],"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Khan","id":"37085668098"},{"name":"Omer.

Structural health management is a vital part of IVHM as arguably structures are the biggest and most costly part of the system, thus the failure of the structure could lead to catastrophic results. The failure of a structure is usually caused by cracks or fractures, to identify the cracks and their growth would be desirable for the SHM. While detection of cracks and the prediction of crack growth is a daunting task, demarcation of the crack is essential to prevent failures. This article presents a technique for the prognostic of crack propagation through aluminium by utilising a time delay neural network algorithm.

As the primary and critical process of PHM, the anomaly detection can discover the abnormal condition and potential fault in time. Generally, monitoring data can reflect the operating condition of components, subsystems or systems. Thus, the monitoring data can be applied to detect the anomalies to improve the system readness and help the system health management. However, monitoring data arriving in the form of streaming gradually shows the growth in variability, velocity and volume. As a result, detecting the anomalies in data stream brings new challenges to traditional anomaly detection algorithm. In this case, this paper proposes a sampling Gaussian process regression (GPR) method for continual anomaly detection based on the specialty of streaming data, providing important information for estimating the system conditon. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated by the synthetic datasets and public data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222493/7245009/07245071.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)","doi":"10.1109/ICPHM.2015.7245071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPHM.2015.7245071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting continual anomalies in monitoring data stream based on sampling GPR algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Ground penetrating radar","Data models","Predictive models","Indexes","Monitoring","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","data mining","Gaussian processes","regression analysis","sampling methods","software reliability","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continual anomaly detection algorithm","monitoring data stream","sampling GPR algorithm","prognostics and health management","PHM","condition based maintenance","CBM","system health management","sampling Gaussian process regression method","synthetic datasets","public data sets","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prognostics and health management","anomoly deteciton","continual anomalies","data stream","Sampling GPR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detecting continual anomalies in monitoring data stream based on sampling GPR algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7245071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15436967","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting continual anomalies in monitoring data stream based on sampling GPR algorithm","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"PHM201598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065032S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222493","isNumber":"7245009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222493","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7245009","articleId":"7245071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245155,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A procedure for designing quantizers for composite signals was developed based on a three-parameter piecewise-linear approximation to the quantizer error threshold function. Observations of picture quality were made using real-time processing on a mixed hardware/software experimental facility, from which it was concluded that between 5 and 6 bits/pel were required for broadcast quality. Preliminary results were obtained on the effect of composite predictive coding on the vertical interval test signals (VITS). Our observations indicate that the waveform distortion criteria applied to VITS give some indication of granular noise visibility (in the SNR measurements); these criteria, however, are too severe in their requirements for slope overload distortion and do not consider edge busyness, an important temporal impairment in predictive coding.","doi":"10.5594/J01298","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227860/7245140/07245155.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J01298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Coding of Composite NTSC Color Television Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245155/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Coding of Composite NTSC Color Television Signals","volume":"91","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Coding of Composite NTSC Color Television Signals","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J01298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019652S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"7245140","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","citationCount":"12","articleId":"7245155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7245209,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Because of the time constraints, ENG increasingly relies on satellite and common carrier facilities to carry video and audio signals from remote locations to the main TV studio. Due to the ongoing digitization of the telecommunication links and eventually of the main station as well as of the ENG recorder itself, it is of prime interest to the broadcaster to study the mechanics of bit-rate reduction for the digital video signal at ENG quality levels. Our study presents a complete digital ENG concept, based on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) techniques permitting the use of links in the DS-3 hierarchy level (44.736 Mbits/sec). On-site recorded news could be transmitted to the main station not only with very short delays but also in a very flexible manner. Several DPCM encoding schemes are investigated to compress the 2:1:1 digital video signal to the desired link capacity. The following parameters are also taken into consideration: error characteristics of the various transmission links, error correction, and portability of the equipment.","doi":"10.5594/J02757","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227860/7245456/07245475.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J02757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DPCM Bit-Rate Reduction for Component TV Signals at ENG Levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","displayDocTitle":"DPCM Bit-Rate Reduction for Component TV Signals at ENG Levels","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"98","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPCM Bit-Rate Reduction for Component TV Signals at ENG Levels","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J02757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199313S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"7245456","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","articleId":"7245475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245676,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38479957600"},{"name":"Liang Pang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Pang","id":"37073118700"},{"name":"Yuhuan Tang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085645175"},{"name":"Hongpeng Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongpeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085655844"},{"name":"Zhi Xue","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37532403100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7977-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7976-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7245676","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Wireless communication","Security","Communication system security","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial noise","Gaussian MIMO wireless hybrid channel","hybrid blind space elimination scheme","HBSE scheme","security problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","wireless hybrid channel","secrecy capacity","artificial noise","MIMO-WHC","HBSE"]}],"abstract":"Security is an important issue in the field of wireless channel. In this paper, the security problem of Gaussian MIMO wireless hybrid channel is considered where a transmitter with multiple antennas sends information to an intended receiver with one antenna in the presence of an eavesdropper with multiple antennas. Through utilizing some of the power to produce `artificial noise', the transmitter can only degrade the eavesdropper's channel to ensure the security of the communication. But there is an inherent weakness in this scheme. Then a Hybrid Blind Space Elimination (HBSE) scheme is proposed and proved to fix the design flaw in order to strengthen the original scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245676","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber Security of Smart Cities, Industrial Control System and Communications (SSIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber Security of Smart Cities, Industrial Control System and Communications (SSIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227128/7245317/07245676.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in MIMO wireless hybrid channel with artificial noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245676/","displayDocTitle":"Security in MIMO wireless hybrid channel with artificial noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15438562","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7245676/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in MIMO wireless hybrid channel with artificial noise","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"SSIC15submission32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077616S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227128","isNumber":"7245317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227128","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7245317","articleId":"7245676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245683,"authors":[{"name":"Prateek Singh","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Prateek","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085680711"},{"name":"Saurabh Garg","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37085684539"},{"name":"Vinod Kumar","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085687444"},{"name":"Zia Saquib","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Zia","lastName":"Saquib","id":"37545919500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7977-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7976-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7245683","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Process control","Protocols","SCADA systems","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human computer interaction","power grids","SCADA systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCADA cyber security","intrusion detection","power grid","cyber physical systems","cyber-physical divide","supervisory control and data acquisition","SCADA","remote terminal units","RTU","master terminal unit","MTU","human machine interface","HMI","industrial control system","ICS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCADA","Industrial Control Systems","SCADA Security","Test-bed","Power System Simulation","Intrusion Detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A testbed for SCADA cyber security and intrusion detection","doi":"10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245317","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber Security of Smart Cities, Industrial Control System and Communications (SSIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber Security of Smart Cities, Industrial Control System and Communications (SSIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227128/7245317/07245683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245683","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245683","abstract":"Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems. Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks. A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI) etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3. The proposed testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438565","htmlLink":"/document/7245683/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A testbed for SCADA cyber security and intrusion detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A testbed for SCADA cyber security and intrusion detection","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"SSIC15submission8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043666S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227128","isNumber":"7245317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227128","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7245317","articleId":"7245683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":7245698,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiket Kapre","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nachiket","lastName":"Kapre","id":"37265546500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1925-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1924-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"7245698","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Random access memory","Sparse matrices","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Registers","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","graph theory","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based soft processor","sparse graph acceleration","address generator","zero-overhead loop iterator","packet-switched network-on-chip","RTL","Vivado high-level synthesis","processor instruction","data memory"]}],"abstract":"FPGA-based soft processors customized for operations on sparse graphs can deliver significant performance improvements over conventional organizations (ARMv7 CPUs) for bulk synchronous sparse graph algorithms.

Several computational PIR protocols provide cryptographic-strength guarantees for the privacy of users, building upon well-known hard mathematical problems, such as factorisation of large integers. Unfortunately, the computational-intensive nature of these solutions results in significant performance overhead, preventing their adoption in practice. In this paper, we employ graphical processing units (GPUs) to speed up the cryptographic operations required by PIR. We identify the challenges that arise when using GPUs for PIR and we propose solutions to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use GPUs for efficient private information retrieval, and an important first step towards GPU-based acceleration of a broader range of secure data operations. Our experimental evaluation shows that GPUs improve performance by more than an order of magnitude.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware acceleration of Private Information Retrieval protocols using GPUs","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245719","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227129/7245687/07245719.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware acceleration of Private Information Retrieval protocols using GPUs","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7245719/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438600","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware acceleration of Private Information Retrieval protocols using GPUs","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074664S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227129","isNumber":"7245687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227129","xplore-issue":"7245687","articleId":"7245719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245720,"authors":[{"name":"Moon Sung Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085614111"},{"name":"Yongje Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yongje","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085383995"},{"name":"Jung Hee Cheon","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Hee","lastName":"Cheon","id":"37408060500"},{"name":"Yunheung Paek","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yunheung","lastName":"Paek","id":"37354590900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1925-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1924-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"7245720","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Encryption","Acceleration","Libraries","Noise","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","graphics processing units","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapping algorithm","FHEW scheme","fully homomorphic encryption scheme","GPU","graphics processing unit","performance acceleration","fast bootstrapping method","CUDA programming model","Compute Unified Device Architecture","FHEW ciphertext bootstrapping"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the usage of GPU is not limited to the jobs associated with graphics and a wide variety of applications take advantage of the flexibility of GPUs to accelerate the computing performance. Among them, one of the most emerging applications is the fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme, which enables arbitrary computations on encrypted data. Despite much research effort, it cannot be considered as practical due to the enormous amount of computations, especially in the bootstrapping procedure. In this paper, we accelerate the performance of the recently suggested fast bootstrapping method in FHEW scheme using GPUs, as a case study of a FHE scheme. In order to optimize, we explored the reference code and carried out profiling to find out candidates for performance acceleration. Based on the profiling results, combined with more flexible tradeoff method, we optimized the bootstrapping algorithm in FHEW using GPU and CUDA's programming model. The empirical result shows that the bootstrapping of FHEW ciphertext can be done in less than 0.11 second after optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245720","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227129/7245687/07245720.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245687","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating bootstrapping in FHEW using GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating bootstrapping in FHEW using GPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245720/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438580","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7245720/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating bootstrapping in FHEW using GPUs","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095113S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227129","isNumber":"7245687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227129","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7245687","articleId":"7245720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245728,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Catania","affiliation":["University of Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Catania","id":"37085514108"},{"name":"Andrea Mineo","affiliation":["University of Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Mineo","id":"37075492600"},{"name":"Salvatore Monteleone","affiliation":["University of Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Monteleone","id":"38555489000"},{"name":"Maurizio Palesi","affiliation":["Kore University, Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Palesi","id":"37268537800"},{"name":"Davide Patti","affiliation":["University of Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Patti","id":"37282082800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1925-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1924-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"7245728","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Computer architecture","Routing","Computational modeling","Topology","Adaptation models","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic simulation","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emerging on-chip communication technologies","wireless networks-on-chip","SystemC","extendible cycle-accurate NoC simulator","open configurable NoC simulator","Noxim","long-range communication","wireless interface","network nodes","multi-hop NoC architectures","scalability limitations","WiNoC"]}],"abstract":"Emerging on-chip communication technologies like wireless Networks-on-Chip (WiNoCs) have been proposed as candidate solutions for addressing the scalability limitations of conventional multi-hop NoC architectures.

Many performance-prediction techniques exist, but those approaches are specific to particular resources or applications, and are often not capable of prediction for all combinations of inputs. In this paper, we introduce an approach to multi-parameter performance modeling based on sampling and interpolation. This approach can be used in conjunction with execution time data, simulated or observed, to quickly perform performance estimation for any function, on any resource, with any combination of inputs. By evaluating a Kriging-based interpolator on a variety of functions and computational resources, we determine bounds on the accuracy of this approach, and show that an interpolation-based approach utilizing Kriging can effectively model execution time for most applications. We also show that Kriging is a highly effective interpolation technique for execution time, and can be up to four orders of magnitude more accurate than nearest-neighbor interpolation or radial basis function interpolation.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245731","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227129/7245687/07245731.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interpolation-based approach to multi-parameter performance modeling for heterogeneous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An interpolation-based approach to multi-parameter performance modeling for heterogeneous systems","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438579","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7245731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interpolation-based approach to multi-parameter performance modeling for heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072545S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227129","isNumber":"7245687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227129","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7245687","articleId":"7245731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7245733,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Hill","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing ECE Dept, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Hill","id":"38490059300"},{"name":"Stefan Craciun","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing ECE Dept, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Craciun","id":"37545523200"},{"name":"Alan George","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing ECE Dept, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"George","id":"37279801000"},{"name":"Herman Lam","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing ECE Dept, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Lam","id":"37270809500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1925-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1924-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"7245733","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1297},"abstract":"Application development with hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL or Verilog involves numerous productivity challenges, limiting the potential impact of reconfigurable computing (RC) with FPGAs in high-performance computing. Major challenges with HDL design include steep learning curves, large and complex codes, long compilation times, and lack of development standards across platforms. A relative newcomer to RC, the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) reduces productivity hurdles by providing a platform-independent, C-based programming language. In this study, we conduct a performance and productivity comparison between three image-processing kernels (Canny edge detector, Sobel filter, and SURF feature-extractor) developed using Altera's SDK for OpenCL and traditional VHDL. Our results show that VHDL designs achieved a more efficient use of resources (59% to 70% less logic), however, both OpenCL and VHDL designs resulted in similar timing constraints (255MHz <; f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n <; 325MHz).

redundancy (TMR) to existing register-transfer-level (RTL) code. Although effective, this approach has a 3\u00d7 area overhead that can be prohibitive for many designs that often allocate resources before considering effects of redundancy. Although a designer could modify existing RTL code to reduce resource usage, such a process is time consuming and error prone. Integrating redundancy into high-level synthesis is a more attractive approach that enables synthesis to rapidly explore different tradeoffs at no cost to the designer. In this paper, we introduce a scheduling and binding heuristic for high-level synthesis that explores tradeoffs between resource usage, latency, and the amount of redundancy. In many cases, an application will not require 100% error correction, which enables significant flexibility for scheduling and binding to reduce resources. Even for applications that require 100% error correction, our heuristic is able to explore solutions that sacrifice latency for reduced resources, and typically save up to 47% when relaxing the latency up to 2\u00d7. When the error constraint is reduced to 70%, our heuristic achieves typical resource savings ranging from 18% to 49% when relaxing the latency up to 2\u00d7, with a maximum of 77%. Even when comparing with optimized RTL designs, our heuristic uses up to 61% fewer resources than TMR.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227129/7245687/07245735.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scheduling and binding heuristic for high-level synthesis of fault-tolerant FPGA applications","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7245735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A scheduling and binding heuristic for high-level synthesis of fault-tolerant FPGA applications","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438583","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7245735/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scheduling and binding heuristic for high-level synthesis of fault-tolerant FPGA applications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076106S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227129","isNumber":"7245687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227129","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7245687","articleId":"7245735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7245739,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

In this paper we implement a decoder for a (32643, 30592) LDPC code that has variable nodes of degree 7, check nodes degrees of 111 and 112, and 228501 edges, making fully-parallel hardware implementation unfeasible. We analyze the structure of this code and describe a method of replacing the complex interconnect with a local, area-efficient version. We develop an modular architecture resulting in a low-complexity partially-parallel decoder architecture based on the offset min-sum algorithm. The proposed decoder is shown to achieve a minimum gain of 92% in area utilization, compared to an extremely optimistic area estimation of the fully-parallel decoder that neglects the interconnection overhead. Synthesis in 65 nm CMOS is performed resulting in a clock frequency of 370 MHz and a throughput of 24 Gbps with an area of 7.99 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245739","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227129/7245687/07245739.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7245687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of structured long block-length LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245739/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation of structured long block-length LDPC codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438588","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7245739/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation of structured long block-length LDPC codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059585S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227129","isNumber":"7245687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227129","xplore-issue":"7245687","articleId":"7245739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7245966,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate a coding system for a transmission rate of 45 M/bits/sec with full broadcast quality. Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) with Variable Word-Length Coding is used to reduce the bit rate for the channel. But this requires a buffer to smooth the data output. Buffer overflow is prevented by quantizer selection and by subsampling. \u2014 We report on 4:3 and 2:1 subsampling ratios. We present a list of general considerations for the design of subsampling patterns and interpolation filters. Various subsampling patterns and corresponding interpolation algorithms and their effects on the quality of the coded picture are evaluated. Adaptive interpolation using samples from the present and the previous field is considered. Simple motion indication circuits for interpolation mode selection are described. A particular interpolation filter using chrominance information from the previous field is effective without resorting to adaptive interpolation. Picture quality judgements are based on observations of specially-selected worst-case conditions using real time processing on a mixed hardware/software experimental facility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7245966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","volume":"91","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Composite Television Coding: Subsampling and Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Television Coding: Subsampling and Interpolation","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J00273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035025S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"7245953","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7245966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7246149,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes an interesting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibres (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution that may combine both a high data rate and a relatively low cost is the free-space optics (FSO). FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions (e.g., rain, fog, line-ofsight, etc.). A more reliable alternative is, therefore, to combine RF and FSO solutions through a hybrid structure called hybrid RF/FSO. Consider a backhaul network, where the base-stations (BS) can be connected to each other either via OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links. The paper addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under connectivity and data rates constraints, so as to choose the appropriate costeffective backhaul type between BSs (i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO). The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by introducing the corresponding planning graph. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247067","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-effective backhaul design using hybrid radio/free-space optical technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective backhaul design using hybrid radio/free-space optical technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247067/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454406","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective backhaul design using hybrid radio/free-space optical technology","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072177S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247068,"authors":[{"name":"Russell Ford","affiliation":["Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Ford","id":"37085570444"},{"name":"Felipe G\u00f3mez-Cuba","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of RF Circuit & System"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"G\u00f3mez-Cuba","id":"37085650508"},{"name":"Marco Mezzavilla","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of RF Circuit & System"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Mezzavilla","id":"37547125900"},{"name":"Sundeep Rangan","affiliation":["New York University, New York, NY, US"],"firstName":"Sundeep","lastName":"Rangan","id":"38516986200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247068","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antennas","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms","millimetre wave antenna arrays","OFDM modulation","radiowave propagation","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic time-domain duplexing","self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks","millimeter wave bands","next-generation cellular networks","very high-dimensional antenna arrays","shadowing","poor high-frequency propagation","multihop relaying","cell range rate improvement","cell edge rate improvement","cellular relay system","wired base stations","user equipment","hierarchical tree structure","fixed relay nodes","access links","TDD duplexing selections","link-by-link basis","directional isolation","greedy algorithm","centralized scheduling","network utility maximization","resources allocation optimization","duplexing schedule optimization","relay-enhanced OFDMA millimeter wave networks","relay-enhanced TDD millimeter wave networks","channel conditions","traffic demands","throughput gains","resource utilization improvement","globally-synchronized TDD patterns","frequency 28 GHz","frequency 30 GHz","frequency 300 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter wave (mmW) bands between 30 and 300 GHz have attracted considerable attention for nextgeneration cellular networks due to vast quantities of availavery high-dimensional antenna arraysble spectrum and the possibility of very high-dimensional antenna arrays. However, a key issue in these systems is range: mmW signals are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation. Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static, globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based on empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247068","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247068.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic time-domain duplexing for self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247068/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic time-domain duplexing for self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454368","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247068/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic time-domain duplexing for self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129422S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247156,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Guidelines are suggested to design an optimized TDM-PON with minimal latency for transport of constant bit rate fronthaul traffic. The total latency is mathematically analyzed using queuing theory, and closed-form formulas are derived which allow study of the trade-offs enabled by the different parameters.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless backhaul networks provide a cost effective approach in urban areas where providing a wired- or fiber-based backhaul is difficult. An important problem in designing such networks is to optimize the position of backhaul hubs in a way that all SCs are properly serviced. However, this is a NP-complete problem requiring suboptimal, but effective, solutions. In this work, we will propose a novel suboptimal algorithm, based on dynamic programming, to solve the NP-hard problem of hub placement in backhaul networks. We will further consider an extended problem of optimizing both the placement of hubs and the orientation of the hub antennas. Our design methodology is backed up with numerical examples using deterministic channel prediction tools which leads to a robust and smart design of the backhaul network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247157","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing placements of backhaul hubs and orientations of antennas in small cell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing placements of backhaul hubs and orientations of antennas in small cell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454684","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing placements of backhaul hubs and orientations of antennas in small cell networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570091297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07925S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247161,"authors":[{"name":"Qianrui Li","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Department, Eurecom, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Qianrui","lastName":"Li","id":"37085764425"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Department, Eurecom, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37085701383"},{"name":"Nicolas Gresset","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric R&D Centre Europe (MERCE), Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Gresset","id":"37283162600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247161","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitters","Quantization (signal)","Optimization","Encoding","MIMO","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","cooperative communication","least mean squares methods","radio transmitters","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity cooperative channel estimation algorithm","coordinated multipoint transmission networks","transmitter devices","partial channel state information estimates","noisy acquisition","cooperative multiantenna transmission","global channel estimates","decentralized algorithm","MMSE-optimal channel estimates","local feedback","inter transmitter communications","CSI-related bits","arbitrary feedback noise statistics","future decentralized CoMP scenarios","channel state information exchange mechanisms"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of coordinated multi-point transmission from transmitter devices that acquire noisy and partial channel state information (CSI) estimates from local feedback links.

To this end, we assume the devices are equipped with rate-limited bi-directional communication links over which they exchange a finite number of CSI-related bits.

However, the randomness of wireless channel and cross-tier interference may cause frequent interruption or fluctuation of video playback, which is challenging for wireless video streaming. In this paper, we consider a femtocell scalable video streaming system in which the femto base station purchases interference quota and provides scalable video streaming service to mobile user under dynamic channel conditions and interference price. We propose a dynamic power and layer selection strategy for maximizing the long-term weighted sum of video quality and cost subject to a constraint on playback smoothness (i.e., interruption and fluctuation). In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require any priori knowledge of the channel dynamics, and is capable of operating online with the currently available information. We also conduct simulations to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247167","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"131","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic power and layer selection for scalable video streaming in femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic power and layer selection for scalable video streaming in femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247167/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454509","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247167/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic power and layer selection for scalable video streaming in femtocell networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570082125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049924S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247176,"authors":[{"name":"Praneeth Jayasinghe","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Praneeth","lastName":"Jayasinghe","id":"37085408095"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Jarkko Kaleva","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Kaleva","id":"38229960800"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247176","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bidirectional control","Receivers","Interference","Resource management","Bismuth","Computer architecture","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","iterative methods","MIMO communication","minimisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized beamforming","dynamic TDD","bidirectional signaling","weighted sum rate","multicell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output dynamic time division duplexing system","instantaneous traffic demand","mean-squared error minimization problem","iterative algorithm","detailed signaling architecture","channel estimation","user MSE weight matrices"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel bi-directional signaling scheme for decentralized beamformer design to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of multi-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) system. In particular, the base stations are assumed to be either in uplink or downlink state based on the instantaneous traffic demand. The WSR maximization problem is solved via the corresponding weighted sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem. An iterative algorithm is proposed with the bi-directional signaling embedded into the TDD frame structure. A detailed signaling architecture is proposed to facilitate channel estimation, exchanging the user beamformers and the user MSE weight matrices among the coordinating nodes. The proposed coordinated system is compared with the uncoordinated system while taking into account the overhead originated from bi-directional signaling. Finally, a periodic beamformer re-initialization strategy is introduced, which enhances the beamformer convergence rate and the system performance in a time-correlated fading environment. The proposed coordinated system provides significant performance gain in an interference limited environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-directional signaling for dynamic TDD with decentralized beamforming","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247176","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247176.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bi-directional signaling for dynamic TDD with decentralized beamforming","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247176/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-directional signaling for dynamic TDD with decentralized beamforming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570092155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046879S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247177,"authors":[{"name":"Ng\u1ecdc-D\u0169ng \u0110\u00e0o","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ng\u1ecdc-D\u0169ng","lastName":"\u0110\u00e0o","id":"37085542821"},{"name":"Hang Zhang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38542591800"},{"name":"Hamid Farmanbar","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Farmanbar","id":"37694513300"},{"name":"Xu Li","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085439957"},{"name":"Aaron Callard","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Callard","id":"37902570900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247177","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Real-time systems","Encoding","Bandwidth","Optimization","Resource management","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","quality of experience","radio access networks","resource allocation","software radio","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio access networks","real time video traffic","peak-to-mean rate ratio","traffic engineering","radio resource allocation","small cell radio networks","video flows","quality of experience","radio coordination","fountain coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","software-defined network (SDN)","radio access network (RAN)","ultra-dense network (UDN)","real-time video","fountain coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce new solutions to handle real-time video traffic, such as video conferencing, in the future software-defined radio access networks.

In this paper, we consider a D2D underlaid cellular network, in which D2D users reuse macrocell downlink spectrum, imposing guard zones around each active D2D transmitter to avoid nearby interference from both macro base stations (MBSs) and other D2D transmitters. Using spatial models and analytical results from stochastic geometry, we provide bounds and approximations for the D2D and cellular coverage probability, as a means to characterize the performance of D2D underlaid cellular networks with intra-tier and cross-tier dependence. The D2D area spectral efficiency (ASE) is also characterized and an approximate optimal guard zone radius that maximizes a lower bound of D2D network throughput is derived in closed-form.

Among those, Wireless Body Sensors (WBS) for cardiac monitoring are of prominent help to early detect CardioVascular Diseases (CVD) by analyzing 24/24 and 7/7 collected cardiac data. Today, most of these WBS systems for CVD detection, include only limited automatic anomalies detection, particularly regarding ECG anomalies. Severe CVD, such as Myocardial Infarction or Ischemia, needs to achieve an advanced analysis of ECG waves known as P, Q, R, S and T. In particular, the T-wave and its specific changes. In this paper, we focus on T-wave anomalies detection in a context of WBS. Our study suggests an accurate and lightweight T-wave changes detection model which suits well an ECG monitoring system based on WBS architecture.

The proposed bundle of full-standard OFDM wireless signals includes broadcast of ETSI EN 300 744 DVB-T signals and multi-format wireless signals 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE), IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and ECMA-368 ultra-wide band (UWB). This bundle of OFDM-based signals is transmitted using radio-over-fibre in overlay with: (i) legacy baseband data of a conventional passive optical network (PON) or (ii) a custom OFDM signal providing Gigabit Ethernet (OFDM-GbE) for next-generation access networks. The optimum RF input power level for the combined bundle of signals is evaluated for both downstream (using external transmission) and upstream (using direct modulation). The successful demodulation of all signals confirms the actual possibility of coexistence of multi-format OFDM wireless with legacy baseband data. Also, it is demonstrated that the system with OFDM-GbE can achieve longer optical reach using centralized OFDM compensation. In this case, the possibility of providing video overlay with more DVB-T channels is confirmed for the complete UHF band.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247198.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-standard broadcast DVB-T and wireless overlay on legacy and OFDM next-generation FTTH networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fibers","WiMAX","Radio frequency","Digital video broadcasting","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","signal processing","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full standard broadcast DVB-T","wireless overlay","OFDM next-generation FTTH networks","wireless signals","next-generation networks","OFDM wireless signals","multiformat wireless signals 3GPP long-term evolution","LTE","worldwide interoperability for microwave access","WiMAX","passive optical network","PON","Gigabit Ethernet","external transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio-over-fibre","fibre-to-the-home (FTTH)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","baseband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Full-standard broadcast DVB-T and wireless overlay on legacy and OFDM next-generation FTTH networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247198/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440596","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-standard broadcast DVB-T and wireless overlay on legacy and OFDM next-generation FTTH networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045111S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247200,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Macho","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Centre Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s","lastName":"Macho","id":"37085397010"},{"name":"Maria Morant","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Centre Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Morant","id":"37315536900"},{"name":"Roberto Llorente","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Centre Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Llorente","id":"37313992500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247200","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","MIMO","Optical fibers","Multicore processing","Optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","optical crosstalk","radio-over-fibre","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO LTE-A","multicore crosstalk impact","optical crosstalk","multicore fibres","MIMO radio-over-fibre optical transmission system","3GPP LTE-Advanced signals","high modulation formats","4-core multicore fibre","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicore fibre system","radio-over-fibre","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","crosstalk"]}],"abstract":"The impact of optical crosstalk in multicore fibres considering both internal and external optical interference on a MIMO radio-over-fibre optical transmission system is experimentally evaluated in this paper.

The experimental results indicate that LTE-A MIMO processing support high-levels of crosstalk induced by internal interference.

The RNN based cognitive engine (CE) learns how the electromagnetic environment is affecting the reliability of communication and can therefore dynamically selects the optimal transmit power for serving users and the users' served by neighbouring cells. The presented CE model has features such as better generalization, fast calculation in run-time, and easy hardware/software implementation. These three features are essential for the development of any real-time cognitive communication system and most of the existing artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based solutions lack them. To achieve the best learning capability, performance evaluation of four learning algorithms (gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIW-PSO), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA)) are applied to RNN and analysed. The analysis showed that AIW-PSO outperformed all other algorithms in terms of both learning and prediction accuracy but with slight compromise on computational complexity and training speed as compared to GD, whereas DE and GA had low performance. Therefore, AIW-PSO based RNN framework is the optimal choice for presented system model.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247202","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247202.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random neural network based power controller for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE-UL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Random neural network based power controller for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE-UL","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454498","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247202/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random neural network based power controller for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE-UL","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056735S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247210,"authors":[{"name":"Vaia Kalokidou","affiliation":["Communication Systems and Networks Research Group MVB, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Vaia","lastName":"Kalokidou","id":"37085369882"},{"name":"Oliver Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37266103500"},{"name":"Robert Piechocki","affiliation":["Communication Systems and Networks Research Group MVB, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Piechocki","id":"37284741400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247210","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247210","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Noise","Transmitters","Decoding","Time division multiple access","Silicon carbide","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","broadcast channels","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SISO broadcast channel","hybrid TIM-NOMA scheme","mobile communication networks","blind interference alignment","BIA","topological interference management","TIM","optimal degrees of freedom","DoF","channel state information","CSI","nonorthogonal multiple access scheme","4G networks","successful interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"Future mobile communication networks will require enhanced network efficiency and reduced system overhead due to their user density and high data rate demanding applications of the mobile devices. Research on Blind Interference Alignment (BIA) and Topological Interference Management (TIM) has shown that optimal Degrees of Freedom (DoF) can be achieved, in the absence of Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters, reducing the network's overhead. Moreover, the recently emerged Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme suggests a different multiple access approach, compared to the current orthogonal methods employed in 4G networks, resulting in high capacity gains. Our contribution is a hybrid TIM-NOMA scheme in Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) K- user cells, in which users are divided into T groups, and 1/T DoF is achieved for each user. By superimposing users in the power domain, we introduce a two-stage decoding process, managing \u201cinter-group\u201d interference based on the TIM principles, and \u201cintra-group\u201d interference based on Successful Interference Cancellation (SIC), as proposed by NOMA.

State-of-the-art research in CR-MAC propose sequential, cluster-CCC coverage for In-band and global CCC coverage for out-of-band spectrum to avoid primary (PU) and secondary (CR) hidden terminals. But, imperfect node synchronization due to per hop and group CCC coverage with In-band CR-MAC cannot resolve hidden terminal problem effectively. On the other hand, even though global CCC coverage with out-of-band CR-MAC provides tight node synchronization to avoid hidden terminals, it is susceptible to intruder attacks and channel saturation. To overcome this, we propose an Interference aware hybrid CCC based CR-MAC protocol with adaptive power control algorithm to avoid both PU and CR multi-channel hidden terminals through tight node synchronization and reduced cognitive control overhead. Experimental results reveal that proposed CR-MAC protocol has increased link throughput and reduced control overhead when compared with existing In-band and out-of-band CCC based CR-MAC protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"393","endPage":"398","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247211.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-aware hybrid CCC-based MAC protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247211/","displayDocTitle":"Interference-aware hybrid CCC-based MAC protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454530","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-aware hybrid CCC-based MAC protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570078421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073179S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247212,"authors":[{"name":"Raouia Masmoudi","affiliation":["ETIS/ ENSEA, University Cergy Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France","LETI, ENIS and University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Raouia","lastName":"Masmoudi","id":"38577359900"},{"name":"E.

The objective is to minimize the overall SU system power consumption (over several orthogonal frequency bands) under minimum Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, maximum peak and average interference to the PUs constraints. The main challenge lies in the non-convexity of the problem because of the discrete spectrum scheduling policies. We overcome this issue by considering a simpler and convex problem based on Lagrangian relaxation. It turns out that, this problem has discrete solutions which are the optimal solutions to our initial non-convex problem. We propose an iterative sub-gradient algorithm to compute the optimal solution, when it exists, assuming that the channels are drawn randomly. In the case of symmetric systems, this algorithm is not suitable. Therefore, we study such a case for which we give an analytical solution. Several numerical results that sustain and give insight into the resolution of this problem are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247212","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference

The messages intended to the ID user need to be kept confidential to the EH user. The channels between BS and users are modeled as fading channels with different spatial correlations and line-of-sight (LoS) components. We assume that only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the BS. Our objective is to design the optimal transmit covariance matrix at the BS for maximizing the ergodic secrecy rate subject to the BS power constraint and the harvested energy requirement for the EH user. To this end, we present an approximation for the ergodic secrecy rate by using large dimensional random matrix theory and the method of Taylor series expansion. Based on this, an iterative algorithm is proposed to find the transmit covariance matrix.

In this model, end users can prefetch a part of popular contents in their local cache. Users make arbitrary requests from the library of available files and interact with each other to deliver requested contents from the local cache to jointly satisfy their demands. The transmission between the users is wiretapped by an external eavesdropper from whom the communication needs to be kept secret. For this model, by exploiting the flexibility offered by the local cache storage, we establish a coding scheme that not only conforms to the demands of all users but also delivers the contents securely. In comparison to the insecure caching schemes, the coding scheme that we develop in this work illustrates that for large number of files and users, the loss incurred due to the imposed secrecy constraints is insignificant. We illustrate our result with the help of some examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247223","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247223.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental limits of caching in D2D networks with secure delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247223/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental limits of caching in D2D networks with secure delivery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454665","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247223/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental limits of caching in D2D networks with secure delivery","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05802S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247224,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhegiang Universitv, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280174900"},{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhegiang Universitv, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Cai","id":"37595612300"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"},{"name":"Minjian Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhegiang Universitv, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minjian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292300200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247224","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"This paper investigates the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) design for secure communications in broadcast multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. We focus on optimizing the nonlinear transceiver to guarantee a certain Quality-of-Service (QoS) level for the intended receiver in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE). The scheme allocates the transmit power in order to achieve the target MSE for the intended receiver, and then uses the remaining available power to transmit artificial noise (AN) to degrade the eavesdropper's channel. With the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) based THP, the lower MSE bound can be achieved. We convert the nonlinear transmit power minimization problem to a standard convex optimization problem. The solution for the problem is obtained by the waterfilling method via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear scheme outperforms existing linear transceiver designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247224.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomlinson-Harashima precoding design in MIMO wiretap channels based on the MMSE criterion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Security","Physical layer","Quality of service","Bit error rate","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","convex programming","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding","quality of service","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tomlinson-Harashima precoding design","THP design","broadcast multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO wiretap channel","MMSE criterion","secure communications","passive eavesdropper","nonlinear transceiver","Quality-of-Service","QoS","mean squared error","artificial noise","eavesdropper channel","geometric mean decomposition","GMD","transmit power minimization problem","convex optimization","waterfilling method","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker","KKT","nonlinear scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial noise","physical layer secure communications","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP)","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tomlinson-Harashima precoding design in MIMO wiretap channels based on the MMSE criterion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247224/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454600","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomlinson-Harashima precoding design in MIMO wiretap channels based on the MMSE criterion","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063568S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247226,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym A.

In this paper, we investigate secure communication over a multi-antenna wiretap channel in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. In the fast fading environment, the overall performance of this channel is traditionally characterized by the ergodic secrecy capacity, which, in general, cannot be derived explicitly. Nevertheless, based on the assumption that the numbers of antennas at legitimate terminals and the number of eavesdroppers grow large without bound, we derive a deterministic approximation of an achievable ergodic secrecy rate for arbitrary inputs. In addition, we characterize the secrecy rates for practically relevant separate-decoding scheme at the receiver. We validate the proposed large-system approximation through numerical simulations and observe a good match with the actual secrecy rates. Finally, we also analyze some interesting behavior of the secrecy rates in the given scenario depending on the geometry of the nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247226.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO wiretap channels with randomly located eavesdroppers: Large-system analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Security","Antennas","Receivers","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","fading channels","geometry","MIMO communication","radio networks","radio receivers","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wiretap channels","randomly located eavesdroppers","large-system analysis","security issues","wireless networks","wireless channels","secure communication","multiantenna wiretap channel","fast fading environment","ergodic secrecy capacity","legitimate terminals","deterministic approximation","ergodic secrecy rate","separate-decoding scheme","large-system approximation","numerical simulations","node geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"MIMO wiretap channels with randomly located eavesdroppers: Large-system analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247226/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454390","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO wiretap channels with randomly located eavesdroppers: Large-system analysis","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094012S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247230,"authors":[{"name":"Yanling Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communication Systems, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407095100"},{"name":"O.

Hence, in the near future, multiple heterogeneous and unlicensed ad hoc networks will coexist within the same geographical area over shared TV White Space. Although heterogeneity and coexistence are not unique to TV White Space scenarios, their distinctive characteristics pose new and challenging issues. In this paper, the problem of the coexistence interference among multiple heterogeneous and secondary ad hoc networks in absence of secondary cooperation is addressed. Specifically, the optimal coexistence strategy, i.e., the coexistence strategy maximizing the expected throughput in presence of coexistence interference, is designed. More in detail, at first, an analytical framework is developed to model the channel selection process for an arbitrary SN as a decision process, where the reward models the data rate achievable on a channel and the cost models the communication overhead for assessing the coexistence interference. Then, we derive the closed-form expression of the expected throughput, which allows us to determine the optimal coexistence strategy. The theoretical analysis is finally validated through a case study.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247231","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247231.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247231","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","startPage":"509","endPage":"513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the coexistence of cognitive radio ad hoc networks in TV White Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the coexistence of cognitive radio ad hoc networks in TV White Space","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247231/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454504","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the coexistence of cognitive radio ad hoc networks in TV White Space","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570080557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065177S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247232,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyu Ping","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Telecommunications Research, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shuyu","lastName":"Ping","id":"37085377273"},{"name":"Adnan Aijaz","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Telecommunications Research, London, UK"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Aijaz","id":"38234486100"},{"name":"Oliver Holland","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Telecommunications Research, London, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Holland","id":"37284761300"},{"name":"A.

The DSA aims at maximizing its total charge to the SUs based on their achieved throughput, while taking into account the additional power consumption of the primary user (PU) to overcome the SUs' interference such that quality of service (QoS) of the PU is guaranteed. The interference between the PU and the SUs as well as the interference within the SUs themselves make the spectrum leasing problem strictly nonconvex and thus difficult to solve in general. To tackle with this difficulty, we exploit the decomposition structure of the concerned spectrum leasing problem and propose a layered monotonic optimization approach to solve it efficiently. Numerical results are presented to validate our proposed approach and its computational efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454698","htmlLink":"/document/7247234/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware spectrum sharing for dynamic spectrum access via monotonic optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware spectrum sharing for dynamic spectrum access via monotonic optimization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570085823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066766S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247236,"authors":[{"name":"Luyao Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Luyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085739414"},{"name":"Kwan-Wu Chin","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Kwan-Wu","lastName":"Chin","id":"37408184200"},{"name":"Sieteng Soh","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sieteng","lastName":"Soh","id":"37385936200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247236","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Interference","Integrated circuit modeling","Time complexity","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","time division multiple access","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wireless mesh networks","link scheduler","time division multiple access","TDMA","Algo-MIMO","MIMO-based WMN","interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) can be improved significantly using multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology. The Degree of Freedoms (DoFs) or antenna elements available at each node enable concurrent transmission/reception of multiple independent data streams or can be used to suppress interference. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) superframe length, in terms of slots, of a multi transmit/receive MIMO-based WMN. We propose a novel heuristic algorithm named Algo-MIMO that uses a recently proposed node ordering DoF model for Interference Cancellation (IC). Numerical results show that Algo-MIMO is able to reduce the superframe length by up to 60% as compared to algorithms that use other IC models, and approximately 40% against algorithms that order nodes based on the number of neighbors, node weight or randomly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient link scheduler for MIMO wireless mesh networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247236","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247236.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"An efficient link scheduler for MIMO wireless mesh networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247236/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454517","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient link scheduler for MIMO wireless mesh networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570086021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059318S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247237,"authors":[{"name":"Yinjie Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, P.

However, multipath propagations in radio channels usually result in the angular spread of signal power, which causes interference among the sectors. Moreover, the random movement of the nodes leads to the variation of the interference. An accurate and mathematically tractable packet-level channel model is a key issue to evaluate the capacity and performance of the spatial multiplexing networks. In this paper, we have considered an indoor mobile ad hoc network where the sink node is equipped with an antenna array for beamforming. First, based on the angular power spectral density (APSD) of the indoor channels obtained by our field measurements, the interference among two nodes is evaluated. Second, by assuming two-dimensional random walk of the network nodes, a finite state Markov chain (FSMC) model is proposed to present the random variation of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the directional links from the nodes to the sink. The closed-form expressions of the state transition probabilities and steady state distributions are derived. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the channel evolution process. The proposed packet-level channel model can be conveniently incorporated into analytical frameworks and fast simulations of upper-layer network protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247238.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A packet-level model for MIMO spatial multiplexing channels in indoor environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiplexing","Interference","Channel models","Azimuth","Analytical models","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","indoor radio","Markov processes","mobile ad hoc networks","protocols","radiofrequency interference","radiowave propagation","space division multiple access","statistical distributions","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-level channel model","MIMO spatial multiplexing channels","indoor environments","directional transmission","directional reception","multiple-input multiple-output technologies","wireless network","multipath propagations","radio channels","signal power angular spread","interference variation","indoor mobile ad hoc network","sink node","antenna array","beamforming","angular power spectral density","indoor channels","APSD","2D random walk","network nodes","finite state Markov chain model","FSMC","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR","directional links","closed-form expressions","state transition probabilities","steady state distributions","channel evolution process","upper-layer network protocols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A packet-level model for MIMO spatial multiplexing channels in indoor environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247238/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454432","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A packet-level model for MIMO spatial multiplexing channels in indoor environments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570094885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042731S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247239,"authors":[{"name":"Miltiades C.

However, so far, there are no regulatory requirements for the coexistence among heterogenous secondary networks over TVWS. Hence, their mutual interference can be very severe. This issue is even more crucial in urban Smart Grid scenarios, where the latency and energy requirements are very tight and multiple Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs) are likely to be located within the same geographical area. Hence, in this paper, the problem of the interference among multiple NANs is addressed with the objective to maximize the achievable data rate. To this aim, the Gateway senses the TVWS channel declared available from incumbents by the WSDB to discover the presence of an interfering NAN. If the sensing declares the TVWS channel as idle, the Gateway can transmit over such a channel. Otherwise, the Gateway uses the ISM channel. Within the paper, the choice of the sensing duration maximizing the achievable data rate at the Gateway, by explicitly accounting for the accuracy/overhead trade-off and the co-located NANs traffic patterns, is addressed. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247241/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454308","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247241/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Smart Grid via TV White Space Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Smart Grid via TV White Space Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056919S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247248,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Ni","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yiyang","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085376235"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536681300"},{"name":"Michail Matthaiou","affiliation":["Queen's University, Chalmers University of Technology, Belfast, Sweden"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Matthaiou","id":"37396192400"},{"name":"Shixiang Shao","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shixiang","lastName":"Shao","id":"37409877100"},{"name":"Hongbo Zhu","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085357990"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247248","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Antennas","Integrated circuits","Approximation methods","Upper bound","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","approximation theory","array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","quantisation (signal)","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming scheme","interference cancellation scheme","D2D communications","device-to-device communications","cellular networks","M-antenna base stations","quantized channel state information","perfect CSI","tight closed-form approximations","ergodic achievable rate","arbitrary transmit power","user location","high signal-to-noise","SNR regime","ceiling effect","5G networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247248","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247248","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","abstract":"We investigate device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks with M-antenna base stations. We consider both beamforming (BF) and interference cancellation (IC) strategies under quantized channel state information (CSI), as well as, perfect CSI. We derive tight closed-form approximations of the ergodic achievable rate which hold for arbitrary transmit power, location of users and number of antennas. Based on these approximations, we derive insightful asymptotic expressions for three special cases namely high signal-to-noise (SNR), weak interference, and large M. In particular, we show that in the high SNR regime a ceiling effect exists which depends on the received signal-to-interference ratio and the number of antennas. Moreover, the achievable rate scales logarithmically with M. The ergodic achievable rate is shown to scale logarithmically with SNR and the antenna number in the weak interference case. When the BS is equipped with large number of antennas, we find that the ergodic achievable rate under quantized CSI reaches a saturated value, whilst it scales as log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nM under perfect CSI.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"608","endPage":"613","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247248.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and interference cancellation schemes for D2D communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247248/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and interference cancellation schemes for D2D communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454357","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and interference cancellation schemes for D2D communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065878S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247251,"authors":[{"name":"Serveh Shalmashi","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Serveh","lastName":"Shalmashi","id":"38521149700"},{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

The channel state information of the device-to-eavesdropper and relay-to-eavesdropper channels is imperfect at the devices and relay.

However, it is challenging to balance the probing time for selecting the optimal relay node and the effective transmission time, both of which will affect the overall throughput of D2D transmissions. In this work, we first build a tractable model for a multi-cell heterogeneous D2D network based on stochastic geometry to evaluate the coverage probability of three location-aware relay selection schemes, namely, All Relays Selection, Sectorized Relays Selection and Distance Based Selection. Based on this model, we develop a practical channel probing process to implement these relay selection schemes and investigate the corresponding transmission capacity under the probing-transmission tradeoff. Numerical results reveals that Distance Based Selection offers the best performance in terms of both coverage probability and transmission capacity when considering the channel-probing cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the tradeoff between optimal relay selection and protocol design in hybrid D2D networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247264","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247264.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the tradeoff between optimal relay selection and protocol design in hybrid D2D networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247264/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454354","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the tradeoff between optimal relay selection and protocol design in hybrid D2D networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077737S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247265,"authors":[{"name":"Meifang Zhu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Meifang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37404531200"},{"name":"Joao Vieira","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Vieira","id":"37085360978"},{"name":"Yubin Kuang","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematics, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Yubin","lastName":"Kuang","id":"38242575100"},{"name":"Kalle \u00c5str\u00f6m","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematics, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kalle","lastName":"\u00c5str\u00f6m","id":"37269881800"},{"name":"Andreas F.

We formulate and solve a robust power allocation optimization problem with a constraint on the localization accuracy for multicast and unicast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals. The localization accuracy is expressed in terms of the expected squared position error bound, accounting for uncertainties in the wireless channel as well as in the agents' positions.

Multipath-assisted indoor navigation and tracking (MINT) is a possible concept to enable robust and accurate localization of an agent in indoor environments. Using a-priori knowledge of a floor plan of the environment and the position of the physical anchors, specular multipath components can be exploited, based on a geometric-stochastic channel model. So-called virtual anchors (VAs), which are mirror images of the physical anchors, are used as additional anchors for positioning. The quality of this additional information depends on the accuracy of the corresponding floor plan. In this paper, we propose a new simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach that allows to learn the floor plan representation and to deal with inaccurate information. A key feature is an online estimated channel characterization that enables an efficient combination of the measurements. Starting with just the known anchor positions, the proposed method includes the VA positions also in the state space and is thus able to adapt the VA positions during tracking of the agent. Furthermore, the method is able to discover new potential VAs in a feature-based manner. This paper presents a proof of concept using measurement data. The excellent agent tracking performance-90%of the error lower than 5 cm-achieved with a known floor plan can be reproduced with SLAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454559","htmlLink":"/document/7247272/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous localization and mapping using multipath channel information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous localization and mapping using multipath channel information","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059186S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247282,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Guerra","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Guerra","id":"38489615300"},{"name":"Francesco Guidi","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Guidi","id":"38499703100"},{"name":"Davide Dardari","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Dardari","id":"37271336300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247282","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":780},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","broadband antennas","femtocellular radio","indoor navigation","millimetre wave antenna arrays","mobile computing","next generation networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position error bound","orientation error bound","wideband massive antenna arrays","next generation cellular networks","femtocells","millimeter-wave communications","communication capacity","high-accuracy indoor positioning","high beamforming capability","mobile terminal localization","single access point","receiving devices","transmitting devices","synchronization error","bandwidth","phased arrays","timed arrays","random arrays","frequency 10 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive array","Position Error Bound","Orientation Error Bound","3D localization"]}],"abstract":"Next generation cellular networks will experience the combination of femtocells, millimeter-wave (mmW) communications and massive antenna arrays. In addition to benefits in terms of an increased communication capacity, this mix of technologies can be fruitfully exploited to enable high-accuracy indoor positioning. In fact, thanks to the high beamforming capability of massive arrays, mobile terminal localization can be performed in principle by using only one single access point (AP), thus avoiding costly infrastructures with additional APs dedicated to positioning. In this context, our paper aims at investigating the localization and orientation performance limits of networks employing wideband massive arrays both at receiving and transmitting devices. In particular, the effects of the array structure, bandwidth and synchronization error are studied both at mmW and at 10GHz, when phased, timed and random arrays are employed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247282","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"853","endPage":"858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position and orientation error bound for wideband massive antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Position and orientation error bound for wideband massive antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247282/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454488","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position and orientation error bound for wideband massive antenna arrays","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570085371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041595S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247285,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Schloemann","affiliation":["Mobile and Portable Radio Research Group (MPRG), Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Schloemann","id":"38131096200"},{"name":"Harpreet S.

However, no tractable approach exists for gaining general insights into localization performance in such networks. Instead, analysis is often done using deterministic network models or with complex system-level simulations, resulting in highly context-specific insights, which do not translate well to random network topologies. In this paper, we motivate and introduce a new approach for analyzing localization performance in cellular networks using tools from point process theory and stochastic geometry. After presenting the model, easy-to-use expressions are derived for the distributions of base station hearability, a metric which is closely-related to localization performance, with and without base station coordination.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"871","endPage":"876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization performance in cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization performance in cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247285/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454429","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247285/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization performance in cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570092231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063668S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247287,"authors":[{"name":"Thi My Chinh Chu","affiliation":["Blekinge Tekniska Hogskola, Karlskrona, SE"],"firstName":"Thi My","lastName":"Chinh Chu","id":"37085338472"},{"name":"Hans-J\u00fcrgen Zepernick","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans-J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Zepernick","id":"37269932400"},{"name":"Hoc Phan","affiliation":["University of Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Hoc","lastName":"Phan","id":"37987468100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247287","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Steady-state","Conferences","Flyback transformers","Markov processes","Dynamic spectrum access","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","Markov processes","probability","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio network","prioritized traffic","channel reservation","DSA control","spectrum band assignment","licensed spectrum","primary traffic network","state transition","multidimensional Markov chain","blocking probability","Class 2 secondary traffic","Class 1 secondary traffic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247287","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247287","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a strategy to coordinate the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) of different types of traffic. It is assumed that the DSA assigns spectrum bands to three kinds of prioritized traffic, the traffic of the primary network, the Class 1 traffic and Class 2 traffic of the secondary network. Possessing the licensed spectrum, the primary traffic has the highest access priority and can access the spectrum bands at anytime. The secondary Class 1 traffic has higher priority compared to secondary Class 2 traffic. In this system, a channel reservation scheme is deployed to control spectrum access of the traffic. Specifically, the optimal number of reservation channels is applied to minimize the forced termination probability of the secondary traffic while satisfying a predefined blocking probability of the primary network. To investigate the system performance, we model state transitions of the DSA as a multi-dimensional Markov chain with three-state variables representing the number of primary, Class 1, and Class 2 packets in the system. Based on this chain, important performance measures, i.e., blocking probability and forced termination probability are derived for the Class 1 and Class 2 secondary traffic.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"883","endPage":"888","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247287.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel reservation for dynamic spectrum access of cognitive radio networks with prioritized traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247287/","displayDocTitle":"Channel reservation for dynamic spectrum access of cognitive radio networks with prioritized traffic","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440593","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel reservation for dynamic spectrum access of cognitive radio networks with prioritized traffic","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570085603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059035S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247288,"authors":[{"name":"Jafar Mohammadi","affiliation":["Communications and Information Theory Chair, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"38010799000"},{"name":"Slawomir Sta\u0144czak","affiliation":["Communications and Information Theory Chair, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Sta\u0144czak","id":"37300829200"},{"name":"Meng Zheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37402108500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247288","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Noise","Detectors","Maximum likelihood estimation","Covariance matrices","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","jamming","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection","statistical testing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint spectrum sensing problem","jamming detection problem","correlated channels","cognitive radio networks","multiple hypothesis testing problem","Neyman-Pearson theorem","asymptotic detection probability","spatially correlated observation data","generalized likelihood ratio test","asymptotic performance derivations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlated signal detection","Jamming detection","Spectrum sensing","Likelihood ratio test"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247288","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247288","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","abstract":"In a cognitive radio (CR) scenario, we study the joint problem of spectrum sensing and jamming detection.

To deal with this problem, the closed-form cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the combine SNRs through maximal ratio combining (MRC) is first derived as a generalized Fox's H\u0305 function. By using this result, outage probability and delay-limited throughput (DLT) are derived in closed forms, which then enables the rate selection for maximum DLT. These analytical results are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. The impacts of time correlation and channel fading-order parameter m upon outage probability, DLT and the optimal rate are investigated thoroughly. It is found that the system can achieve more diversity gain from less correlated channels, and the outage probability of cooperative HARQ-CC system decreases with the increase of m, and etc. Furthermore, the optimal rate increases with the number of retransmissions, while it decreases with the increase of the channel time correlation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247293","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247293.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate selection for cooperative HARQ-CC systems over time-correlated Nakagami-m fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247293/","displayDocTitle":"Rate selection for cooperative HARQ-CC systems over time-correlated Nakagami-m fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454348","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247293/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate selection for cooperative HARQ-CC systems over time-correlated Nakagami-m fading channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065625S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247295,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Amin","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Amin","id":"38185372300"},{"name":"Ebrahim Bedeer","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Bedeer","id":"37713883200"},{"name":"Mohamed H.

In this paper, we formulate an accurate EE metric for cooperative two-hop systems that use the amplify-and-forward relaying scheme. Different from the existing research that assumes the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the communication cooperative nodes, we assume a practical scenario, where training pilots are used to estimate the channels. The estimated CSI can be used to adapt the available resources of the proposed system in order to maximize the EE. Two estimation strategies are assumed namely disintegrated channel estimation, which assumes the availability of channel estimator at the relay, and cascaded channel estimation, where the relay is not equipped with channel estimator and only forwards the received pilot(s) in order to let the destination estimate the cooperative link. The channel estimation cost is reflected on the EE metric by including the estimation error in the signal-to-noise term and considering the energy consumption during the estimation phase. Based on the formulated EE metric, we propose an energy-aware power allocation algorithm to maximize the EE of the cooperative system with channel estimation. Furthermore, we study the impact of the estimation parameters on the optimized EE performance via simulation examples.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247295.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"936","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient power allocation of two-hop cooperative systems with imperfect channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient power allocation of two-hop cooperative systems with imperfect channel estimation","htmlLink":"/document/7247295/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454647","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient power allocation of two-hop cooperative systems with imperfect channel estimation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070926S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247297,"authors":[{"name":"Shashindra Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Shashindra","lastName":"Silva","id":"37085754748"},{"name":"Gayan Amarasuriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gayan","lastName":"Amarasuriya","id":"37394070900"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37085488004"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"38247185800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247297","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Approximation methods","Antennas","Multiplexing","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","approximation theory","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection strategies","MIMO two-way relay networks","spatial multiplexing","multiple-input multiple-output amplify-and-forward two-way relay networks","Wishart matrices","average sum rate approximations"]}],"abstract":"Relay selection strategies help to improve spectral and energy efficiencies, to enhance transmission robustness, or to reduce latency in cooperative networks.

Interestingly, this strategy amounts to maximizing the minimum of the determinant of the Wishart matrices from the relays to the two user nodes.

However, these receivers are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance, low-noise amplifier nonlinearities and phase noise, which limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. In this paper, we study the joint effects of RF impairments on energy detection based spectrum sensing in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide an analytical framework for the evaluation of the probabilities of detection and false alarm, assuming Rayleigh fading and approximating the joint effects of RF impairments by a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results illustrate the detrimental effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247299.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"960","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy detection under RF impairments for cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Gaussian distribution","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF impairments","direct-conversion radio receivers","cognitive radio systems","radio frequency impairments","energy detection based spectrum sensing","probabilities of detection","Rayleigh fading","Gaussian distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy detection under RF impairments for cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247299/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454502","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy detection under RF impairments for cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570084289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100708S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247301,"authors":[{"name":"Petri Luoto","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Luoto","id":"37085487132"},{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bennis","id":"37299803500"},{"name":"Pekka Pirinen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Pirinen","id":"37269607400"},{"name":"Sumudu Samarakoon","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Sumudu","lastName":"Samarakoon","id":"38467989600"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247301","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Layout","Resource management","Base stations","Buildings","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gibbs sampling based spectrum sharing","multioperator small cell networks","small cell base stations","spectral allocations","decentralized control mechanism","Gibbs sampling based learning techniques","heterogeneous traffic","fifth generation mobile communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["co-primary spectrum sharing","heterogeneous traffic","multi-operator","small cell","fairness","system level simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247301","abstract":"To tackle the challenge of providing higher data rates within limited spectral resources we consider the case of multiple operators sharing a common pool of radio resources in the downlink. The goal is to maintain a long term fairness of spectrum sharing with a no coordination among small cell base stations. It is assumed that the spectral allocations of the small cells are orthogonal to the macro network layer and thus, only the small cell traffic is modeled. We develop a decentralized control mechanism for base stations using Gibbs sampling based learning techniques. Four algorithms are compared addressing the co-primary multi-operator radio resource sharing under heterogeneous traffic in both centralized and distributed scenarios. The performance of these algorithms is assessed through extensive system-level simulations for two indoor small cell layouts. The main performance metrics are user throughput and fairness between operators. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Gibbs sampling based learning algorithm provides considerably high throughput while ensuring fairness between OPs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247301","startPage":"967","endPage":"972","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247301.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gibbs Sampling based Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Operator Small Cell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Gibbs Sampling based Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Operator Small Cell Networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247301/","accessionNumber":"15454503","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247301/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gibbs Sampling based Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Operator Small Cell Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053032S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7247303,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afana","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afana","id":"38469714700"},{"name":"Telex M.

Intra-session network coding is used at the source nodes and inter-session network coding is employed at the relay node to combine the recovered source packets of both source nodes. In this work, we investigate the performance of the network-coded system in terms of the probability that the destination node will successfully recover the source packets of the two source nodes. We build our analysis on fundamental probability expressions for random matrices over finite fields and we derive upper bounds on the system performance for the case of systematic and non-systematic network coding. Simulation results show that the upper bounds are very tight and accurately predict the decoding probability at the destination node. Our analysis also exposes the clear benefits of systematic network coding at the source nodes compared to non-systematic transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of random linear network coding in two-source single-relay networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247305","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247305.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of random linear network coding in two-source single-relay networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247305/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454312","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of random linear network coding in two-source single-relay networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106062S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247306,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal A.

The fusion center then makes the final decision on the presence of primary users by recovering the overall test statistic of energy detection from the energy of the received signal. Performance metrics of the CoMAC-based CSS scheme, i.e., detection probability and false alarm probability, are further derived based on the central limit theorem. Finally, based on the derived detection and false alarm probabilities, both energy detection threshold and spectrum sensing time are optimized to improve the average throughput of the CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247308/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454508","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247308/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel CoMAC-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel CoMAC-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570085729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052211S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247312,"authors":[{"name":"Italo Atzeni","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

In this paper we revisit the use of high-dimensional arrays in line-of-sight single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We develop a channel model that reveals coupling between the spatial and temporal dimensions that is not captured by conventional separable models.

By exploiting the sparsity of significant propagation paths in massive MIMO channels, we develop a compressed sensing (CS) based channel estimator that can reduce the pilot overhead as compared with the conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators. The proposed scheme is based on the oblique matching pursuit (ObMP), an extension of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), that can exploit prior information about the sparse signal vector. Given the channel covariance matrix, we obtain the incidence probability that each quantized angle coincides with the angle-of-departure (AoD) and use the incidence probability for deriving the oblique operator of the proposed scheme. The pilot sequence is designed to minimize the MSE of the oracle estimator. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme over various existing methods including the LS, MMSE and OMP estimators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation via oblique matching pursuit for FDD massive MIMO downlink","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247317","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247317.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation via oblique matching pursuit for FDD massive MIMO downlink","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247317/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation via oblique matching pursuit for FDD massive MIMO downlink","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069989S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247318,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 B.J.

Key is the use of coarse quantisation of the individual antenna signals next to the analog beamforming. The extreme case of single bit quantization is analyzed. Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, being the crucial element in beamsteering, is only slightly deteriorated compared to DoA estimation based on full precision (analog) signals. For Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) below 0 dB, single bit quantization introduces ~2 dB noise level increase. For SNRs beyond 0 dB, the standard deviation of the DoA estimate, levels out to below 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n radian in our specific case study. An additional correction called the Van Vleck correction, mitigates the effects of single bit quantization. This effect can clearly be seen in case multiple signals impinge on the array. When using this correction, the probability of correct detection of multiple sources (in this paper we use 2 sources) is comparable to the performance of an analog system. We therefore conclude that digital beamsteering can effectively and efficiently be combined with analog beamforming.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digitally assisted analog beamforming for millimeter-wave communication","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247318","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247318.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Digitally assisted analog beamforming for millimeter-wave communication","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247318/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454453","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitally assisted analog beamforming for millimeter-wave communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091846S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247320,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lin","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405075900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247320","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":862},"abstract":"Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OQAM) has been actively investigated for decades. Now it is also a candidate for 5G air interface waveform. Nevertheless, when it goes to standardization consideration, people still prefer Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM), in spite of its identified drawbacks for 5G. Such conservative attitude comes from the fact that people are not sure about how costly it would be to adapt all the existing OFDM-based solutions to FBMC systems, in particular for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques. For FBMC, these can be interpreted as compatibility and complexity issues. In this paper, we intend to solve these two issues by introducing a new way of looking at FBMC, where we challenge the traditional transmission fashion. Eventually, our study brings us to a more concise and compatible format which we call it Filter-Bank OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247320.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter bank OFDM: A new way of looking at FBMC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Complexity theory","MIMO","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel bank filters","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter bank OFDM","FBMC systems","filter bank multicarrier","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","OQAM","5G air interface waveform","multiple-input-multiple-output techniques","MIMO techniques","compatibility issues","complexity issues"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Filter bank OFDM: A new way of looking at FBMC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247320/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454379","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter bank OFDM: A new way of looking at FBMC","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04784S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247321,"authors":[{"name":"Tachporn Sanguanpuak","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Communication Engineering, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand","Department of Communication Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tachporn","lastName":"Sanguanpuak","id":"37680349500"},{"name":"Sudarshan Guruacharya","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sudarshan","lastName":"Guruacharya","id":"37680115600"},{"name":"Nandana Rajatheva","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Nandana","lastName":"Rajatheva","id":"37332381600"},{"name":"Matti Latva-Aho","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-Aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247321","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","MIMO","Decoding","Joints","Resource management","Antennas","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser channels","optimisation","Rayleigh channels","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","co-primary spectrum sharing","MIMO networks","multiuser network","downlink transmission","Rayleigh fading","interfering broadcast channel","multiple antennas","weighted sum rate maximization problem","subcarrier allocation","Gale-Shapley algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"We study co-primary spectrum sharing concept in two small cell multiuser network.

In addition, the truncated conjugate gradient trust region (TCGTR) algorithm is proposed to estimate the channel vectors. The TCGTR algorithm, as an iterative regularization method, is widely used for large scale optimization because of its remarkable performance and fast convergence. The novelty of the TCGTR algorithm lies in the fact that it has never been used for channel estimation before. The complexity of the TCGTR algorithm is analyzed in this work.

However, due to different radio frequency branches for transmitting and receiving, calibrating the antenna array at the base station (BS) is necessary to effect this reciprocity between the end-to-end downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) channels. As the array size gets large in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems, this procedure becomes extremely challenging if we simply rely on the existing antenna calibration approaches including \u201cSelf-Calibration\u201d and \u201cOver-the-Air Calibration (OTA)\u201d. To release all the potentials of massive MIMO, this paper relies on compressive sensing theory and develops an efficient and robust way to calibrate the massive antenna array while only requiring a limited amount of channel state information (CSI) feedback. This work is the prerequisite for actual deployment of massive MIMO technique and allows us to take full advantage of the channel reciprocity in massive MIMO under TDD operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247327.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1124","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to calibrate massive MIMO?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","calibration","compressed sensing","MIMO communication","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO","time-division duplexing system","TDD system","channel reciprocity","antenna array","base station","end-to-end downlink channels","uplink channels","massive multi-input multi-output antenna system","compressive sensing theory","channel state information feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Compressive Sensing","Antenna Calibration","Time-Division Duplexing","Sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"How to calibrate massive MIMO?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247327/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454612","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to calibrate massive MIMO?","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570079929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059642S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247329,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085591730"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293664100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247329","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"abstract":"The uplink of full-duplex multi-cell massive MEMO systems is analyzed in this paper. Besides the interference due to multi-user transmissions as in half duplex massive MIMO system-s, interference from other base stations (BSs) and self-interference coming from the base station's downlink transmission would occur, which complicates the analysis on the uplink achievable rate. To be practical, both antenna correlation and line-of-sight (LoS) path are considered in the BS-to-BS channel model. A deterministic approximation of the uplink achievable rate is derived based on random matrix theory. It is then proved that the BS-to-BS interference and self interference would asymptotically vanish. It means the asymptotic achievable rate is exactly the double of that of half-duplex transmission. With finite number of antennas per-BS, however, the BS-to-BS interference and self interference would limit the performance of full duplex. To ensure full duplex to outperform half duplex in the uplink, the number of antennas per-BS should be larger than a threshold which is also derived explicitly. Finally the accuracy of the analytical results is validated by computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247329.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1136","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink achievable rate of full-duplex multi-cell massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex multicell massive MIMO systems","uplink achievable rate","multiuser transmissions","base station","self interference","downlink transmission","antenna correlation","line-of-sight path","BS-to-BS channel","deterministic approximation","random matrix theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex MIMO radio","massive MIMO","multi-cell wireless system","large system analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Uplink achievable rate of full-duplex multi-cell massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247329/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454699","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink achievable rate of full-duplex multi-cell massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570082495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137385S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247330,"authors":[{"name":"Yeqing Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"firstName":"Yeqing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085703687"},{"name":"Yi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276995200"},{"name":"Jamie Evans","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Evans","id":"37269068700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247330","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Approximation methods","MIMO","Uplink","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","directive antennas","diversity reception","linear antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mixture models","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single cell multiuser massive multiple-input-multiple-output system","single cell multiuser massive MIMO system","multi-antenna base station","single-antenna users","directional linear antenna arrays","uplink power control","line-of-sight channels","LoS channels","receiver maximum-ratio-combining","receiver MRC","intra-sector interference","single-user interference","multi-user interference","Beta-mixture distributions","coverage probability","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the uplink in a single cell multi-user massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, where the multi-antenna base station (BS) serves single-antenna users.

Beamforming (BF) is tremendously used with mm-w transmissions to enhance the link quality and overcome the channel impairments. The current mm-w BF mechanism, proposed by the IEEE 802.11ad standard, is mainly based on exhaustive searching the best transmit (TX) and receive (RX) antenna beams. This BF mechanism requires a very high setup time, which makes it difficult to coordinate a multiple number of mm-w Access Points (APs) in mobile channel conditions as a 5G requirement. In this paper, we propose a mm-w BF mechanism, which enables a mm-w AP to estimate the best beam to communicate with a User Equipment (UE) using statistical learning. In this scheme, the fingerprints of the UE WiFi signal and mm-w best beam identification (ID) are collected in an offline phase on a grid of arbitrary learning points (LPs) in target environments. Therefore, by just comparing the current UE WiFi signal with the pre-stored UE WiFi fingerprints, the mm-w AP can immediately estimate the best beam to communicate with the UE at its current position. The proposed mm-w BF can estimate the best beam, using a very small setup time, with a comparable performance to the exhaustive search BF.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247333","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247333.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247333","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter wave beamforming based on WiFi fingerprinting in indoor environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave beamforming based on WiFi fingerprinting in indoor environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247333/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454650","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave beamforming based on WiFi fingerprinting in indoor environment","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064332S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247334,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Saito","affiliation":["5G Laboratory, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Saito","id":"38264109600"},{"name":"Anass Benjebbour","affiliation":["5G Laboratory, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Anass","lastName":"Benjebbour","id":"37294604500"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["5G Laboratory, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37085578262"},{"name":"Yukihiko Okumura","affiliation":["5G Laboratory, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiko","lastName":"Okumura","id":"37085336357"},{"name":"Takehiro Nakamura","affiliation":["5G Laboratory, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37085367282"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247334","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1781},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247334","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Downlink","Long Term Evolution","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio equipment","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIC receiver","downlink NOMA","open-loop SU-MIMO","interference cancellation","SIC","downlink nonorthogonal multiple access","NOMA","single input multiple output","SIMO","interstream interference","transmission rank combination","user equipment","interuser interference","codeword level SIC","CWIC","symbol level SIC","SLIC","long term evolution","LTE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","NOMA","Successive interference cancellation","SIC","SU-MIMO"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the performance and design of successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) combined with 2-by-2 open-loop single-user (SU)-MIMO.

D2D communication enables the users located in close proximity to each other to communicate directly without going through the macro-cell, and hence, can be utilised to offload the traffic from the cellular infrastructure. This paper investigates the trade-off between Area Energy Efficiency (AEE) and Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE) in D2D-enabled uplink heterogeneous networks. The tradeoff is modelled as an optimization problem, in which each user wants to maximize its own ASE subject to its required AEE levels. Taking into consideration of the AEE requirement and maximum transmission power constraint, a distributed resource allocation approach is proposed to jointly optimize the mode selection, subcarrier and optimal power allocation by exploiting the properties of fractional programming. The relationship between the achievable AEE and ASE trade-off is investigated with different network parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247337/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454594","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Area energy and area spectrum efficiency trade-off in 5G heterogeneous networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area energy and area spectrum efficiency trade-off in 5G heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079092S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247338,"authors":[{"name":"Niklas A.

However, wireless channels at mmWave frequencies experience higher isotropic path loss. Therefore, employing a suitable beamforming algorithm is an indispensable element of any mmWave system. Traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employ digital beamforming where each antenna element is equipped with one RF chain. In case of mmWave systems, however, the power consumption, signalling and hardware cost impose the designers to deploy analog or hybrid beamforming strategies. This paper addresses two key problems in beamforming for millimeter wave communication systems. First, an effective codebook is designed, using a genetic algorithm that achieves a near-optimal array gain in all directions. This RF codebook is shown to perform better compared to the state-of-the-art RF codebooks with fewer RF chains and lower resolution phase shifters. Secondly, a low complexity channel estimation scheme is proposed that requires less signalling overhead and is effective with low-resolution phase shifters. Finally, the performance of the proposed RF codebook and channel estimation scheme is thoroughly investigated in terms of spectral efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247345.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1231","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective RF codebook design and channel estimation for millimeter wave communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Channel estimation","Phase shifters","Array signal processing","Arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","genetic algorithms","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave phase shifters","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave technologies","mmWave technologies","mobile communication systems","wireless channels","isotropic path loss","multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO systems","digital beamforming","antenna element","millimeter wave communication systems","genetic algorithm","RF codebooks","low complexity channel estimation scheme","low-resolution phase shifters","spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter wave","beamforming","RF codebook design","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Effective RF codebook design and channel estimation for millimeter wave communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440576","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective RF codebook design and channel estimation for millimeter wave communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053641S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247346,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alkhateeb","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group The University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Alkhateeb","id":"37085375383"},{"name":"Robert W.

A natural application of antenna arrays is simultaneous transmission to multiple users, which requires multi-user precoding at the transmitter. Hardware constraints, however, make it difficult to apply conventional lower frequency MIMO precoding techniques at mmWave. This paper proposes and analyzes a low complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding algorithm for downlink multi-user mmWave systems. Hybrid precoding involves a combination of analog and digital processing that is motivated by the requirement to reduce the power consumption of the complete radio frequency and mixed signal hardware. The proposed algorithm configures hybrid precoders at the transmitter and analog combiners at multiple receivers with a small training and feedback overhead. For this algorithm, we derive a lower bound on the achievable rate for the case of single-path channels, show its asymptotic optimality at large numbers of antennas, and make useful insights for more general cases. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers higher sum rates compared with analog-only beamforming, and approaches the performance of the unconstrained digital precoding solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247346.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1237","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable rates of multi-user millimeter wave systems with hybrid precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Array signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Antenna arrays","NIST","MIMO","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser millimeter wave system","hybrid precoding","antenna arrays","lower frequency MIMO precoding techniques","hybrid analog-digital precoding algorithm","asymptotic optimality","analog-only beamforming","unconstrained digital precoding solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rates of multi-user millimeter wave systems with hybrid precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247346/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454376","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rates of multi-user millimeter wave systems with hybrid precoding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052052S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247347,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore S.

Antennas are organized in uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed solution is based on estimation of a channel sub-matrix and exploits properties of the UPA model. In particular, we first organize UPA indices in a way that simplifies further processing, then we propose a training sequence that minimizes the number of RF chains.

This paper considers scenarios where the ratio of the channel coherence time to the number of users in a cell may be sufficiently large.

Another important scenario is when the service provider is interested in maximizing the sum rate over a fixed, selected number of users rather than the sum rate over all users in the cell. A sum-rate comparison analysis shows that in such scenarios less aggressive reuse of pilots involving allocation of additional pilots for interfering users yields significant performance advantage relative to the case where all cells reuse the same pilot set.

By utilizing the property of the steering vector, a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based post-processing is introduced after the conventional pilot-aided channel estimation. Under the condition that different users with the same pilot sequence have non-overlapping angle-of-arrivals (AOAs), the proposed channel estimation algorithm is capable of distinguishing these users effectively. To cooperate with the location-based channel estimation, a pilot assignment algorithm is also proposed to ensure that the users in different cells using the same pilot sequence have different AOAs at base station. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the inter-cell interference caused by the reuse of the pilot sequence and thus improves the overall system performance significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247351.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1268","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location-based channel estimation and pilot assignment for massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Interference","Antennas","Signal processing algorithms","Partial transmit sequences","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","direction-of-arrival estimation","fast Fourier transforms","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiinput multioutput systems","massive MIMO systems","location-based channel estimation","pilot assignment","steering vector","fast Fourier transform","FFT","pilot-aided channel estimation","pilot sequence","nonoverlapping angle-of-arrivals","intercell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","pilot contamination","inter-cell interference","location-based channel estimation","pilot assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Location-based channel estimation and pilot assignment for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247351/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454685","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-based channel estimation and pilot assignment for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061727S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247353,"authors":[{"name":"Sarabjot Singh","affiliation":["Nokia Inc., Berkeley, CA"],"firstName":"Sarabjot","lastName":"Singh","id":"38241108400"},{"name":"Xinchen Zhang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Xinchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085442286"},{"name":"Jeffrey G.

However, the impact of such offloading on the uplink performance is not well understood, primarily due to the lack of tractable models. Uplink power control and spatial interference correlation further complicate the mathematical analysis as compared to the downlink. In this paper, we propose a tractable and general model to characterize the uplink SIR and rate distribution in a K-tier HCN as a function of the association and power control parameters. Using the developed analysis, it is shown that the optimal degree of channel inversion (for uplink power control) increases with load imbalance in the network. Minimum path loss association is shown to maximize uplink rate coverage. Moreover, with minimum path loss association and full channel inversion, uplink coverage is shown to be invariant of infrastructure density.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247353.pdf","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1280","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink rate distribution in heterogeneous cellular networks with power control and load balancing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Uplink rate distribution in heterogeneous cellular networks with power control and load balancing","htmlLink":"/document/7247353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454558","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink rate distribution in heterogeneous cellular networks with power control and load balancing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074705S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247354,"authors":[{"name":"Reham Almesaeed","affiliation":["Communication Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Reham","lastName":"Almesaeed","id":"37085352028"},{"name":"Araz S.

Therefore a 3D channel model is required for an accurate evaluation of MIMO performance. The MIMO system can also be deployed at the user terminal according to the LTE-Advanced system specifications. Therefore, this study exploits the elevation dimension at the user equipment (UE) MIMO receiver and proposes an antenna switching strategy to achieve the highest performance among the MIMO spatial streams. This study is considered as one of the solutions toward boosting MIMO capacity and enhancing end user experience for 5G systems. The study considers different types of user handsets such as smartphone and tablet where different scenarios of antennas placements are implemented and different number of antennas elements are deployed. The consideration of the 3D component in the modelling of the MIMO channels results in performance differences in the MIMO system in terms of ergodic capacity and spatial correlation as the handset rotates. The paper suggests the best arrangement of antenna elements for the UE handset manufacturers to achieve the highest channel capacity when exploiting the elevation plane.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247354","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the elevation dimension of MIMO system for boosting handset capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the elevation dimension of MIMO system for boosting handset capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247354/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454337","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the elevation dimension of MIMO system for boosting handset capacity","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047416S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247355,"authors":[{"name":"Umut Ugurlu","affiliation":["Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Umut","lastName":"Ugurlu","id":"37085481793"},{"name":"Risto Wichman","affiliation":["Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Wichman","id":"37269114900"},{"name":"Cassio Barboza Ribeiro","affiliation":["NOKIA GROUP, Nokia, Finland"],"firstName":"Cassio Barboza","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37268401300"},{"name":"Carl Wijting","affiliation":["NOKIA GROUP, Nokia, Finland"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Wijting","id":"37326949000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247355","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Optimization","MIMO","Uplink","Least squares approximations","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","iterative methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","singular value decomposition","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalue decomposition","EVD-based uplink channel estimator","multicell massive MIMO network","multiple input multiple output","finite transmit sample","iterative optimization procedure","signaling scheme","multicell coordination","coordinated optimization scheme","symbol error rate"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) based uplink channel estimation in multi-cell massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) networks.

This paper further expands the application of FBMC to massive MIMO by applying frequency spreading equalization (FSE) to these channels. FSE allows us to achieve a more accurate equalization. Hence, higher number of bits per symbol can be transmitted and the bandwidth of each subcarrier can be widened. Widening the bandwidth of each subcarrier leads to (i) higher bandwidth efficiency; (ii) lower complexity; (iii) lower sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO); (iv) reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); and (iv) reduced latency. All these appealing advantages have a direct impact on the digital as well as analog circuitry that is needed for the system implementation. In this paper, we develop the mathematical formulation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) FSE for massive MIMO systems.

The analysis is conducted for the setting where neither the transmitter nor the receiver have a priori information on the realization of the fading channels. This means that channel-state information needs to be acquired at the receiver on the basis of the one-bit quantized channel outputs. We show that least-squares (LS) channel estimation combined with joint pilot and data processing is capacity achieving in the single-user, single-receive-antenna case. We also investigate the achievable uplink throughput in a massive multiple-input multiple-output system where each element of the antenna array at the receiver base-station feeds a one-bit ADC. We show that LS channel estimation and maximum-ratio combining are sufficient to support both multiuser operation and the use of high-order constellations. This holds in spite of the severe non-linearity introduced by the one-bit ADCs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247358","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247358.pdf","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-bit massive MIMO: Channel estimation and high-order modulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"One-bit massive MIMO: Channel estimation and high-order modulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247358/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454523","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247358/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-bit massive MIMO: Channel estimation and high-order modulations","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076399S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7247359,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Puglielli","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Puglielli","id":"37085629376"},{"name":"Nathan Narevsky","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Narevsky","id":"38466855800"},{"name":"Pengpeng Lu","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pengpeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085621597"},{"name":"Thomas Courtade","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Courtade","id":"37399350300"},{"name":"Gregory Wright","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Wright","id":"37366431000"},{"name":"Borivoje Nikolic","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Borivoje","lastName":"Nikolic","id":"37268296200"},{"name":"Elad Alon","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Alon","id":"37270360800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":832},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Power demand","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","MIMO","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","interference suppression","MIMO communication","modules","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO array scalability","common module","5G wireless","interference reduction","RF transceiver","data converter","digital nearest-neighbor mesh network","analog signal distribution","distributed beamforming algorithm","backhaul datarate","power consumption","multiple input multiple output array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247359","abstract":"Massive MIMO is envisioned as one of the key enabling technologies for 5G wireless and beyond. While utilizing the spatial dimension to reduce interference and increase capacity in multi-user scenarios, massive MIMO base stations present several unique implementation challenges due to their large physical size and the high datarate generated by all the elements. To be cost-effective and energy efficient, practical designs must leverage the particular characteristics of massive MIMO to ensure scalability. Here, we propose an array architecture based on a common module which serves a small number of antennas with RF transceivers, data converters, and several support functions. Multiple chips are tiled into a grid and interconnected through a digital nearest-neighbor mesh network, avoiding the severe problems associated with analog signal distribution. Scalability across a wide range of array sizes is achieved by using distributed beamforming algorithms. It is demonstrated that by using this approach, the maximum backhaul datarate scales as the number of users rather than the number of antennas. Finally, we present a detailed accounting of the power consumption of the array and use the resulting optimization problem to show that per-element overhead limits the minimum achievable power consumption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247359.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247359","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable massive MIMO array architecture based on common modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247359/","displayDocTitle":"A scalable massive MIMO array architecture based on common modules","htmlLink":"/document/7247359/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454552","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable massive MIMO array architecture based on common modules","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071184S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247360,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Li","id":"37085446702"},{"name":"Sujeet Patole","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sujeet","lastName":"Patole","id":"37076175600"},{"name":"Murat Torlak","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Torlak","id":"37281051200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247360","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"For massive MIMO system, few research has been done for multipath frequency selective fading model among all literatures.

To avoid collecting large number of samples (which requires additional storage resources and may cause significant system delay), we are focusing on detection methods which use less samples.

This paper considers high-speed visible light communication (VLC) as a candidate serving technology to fulfill this set of requirements. Synchronization as the first step towards reliable data detection is studied here thoroughly aiming at high robustness and low complexity. Three schemes are reviewed, namely Schmidl-Cox and Park autocorrelation as well as a cross-correlation based approach, all using a predefined preamble. All schemes are examined concerning their robustness against multipath propagation and their precision in time estimation versus the preamble length. It is found that the simple Schmidl-Cox scheme, originally designed for complex-valued radio waveforms, can be applied also for real-valued optical wireless waveforms. Based on these investigations, an optimized preamble structure is finally proposed. Preamble boosting and fine synchronization can also be applied to reach a similar performance like optimal cross-correlation at reduced complexity. We study the fundamental trade-off between the preamble duration and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for reliable synchronization and observe that ultra-low latency needs sufficient SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247362.pdf","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1332","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-latency synchronization for OFDM-based visible light communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Accuracy","Robustness","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","correlation theory","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optimisation","synchronisation","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G wireless system","OFDM-based visible light communication","low latency synchronization","reliable data detection","robustness","Park autocorrelation scheme","cross-correlation based approach","multipath propagation","time estimation","preamble length","Schmidl-Cox scheme","complex valued radio waveform","real valued optical wireless waveform","preamble structure optimisation","preamble boosting","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-latency synchronization for OFDM-based visible light communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247362/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454659","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-latency synchronization for OFDM-based visible light communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069802S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247363,"authors":[{"name":"V.

with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) based visible light communication (VLC) system. Gallium nitride based micro light emitting diodes (\u03bcLEDs) are considered as a transmitter unit. A two transmitter and two optical receiver based MIMO setup is used. The performance of OSM-OFDM system is experimentally analysed by varying the semi-angle at half power, \u03b8\u00bd of the \u03bcLEDs. The optical cross-talk in the MIMO channel is quantified and its effect on the achievable data rate and bit error rate (BER) performance is analysed. The experimental results show that OSM-OFDM achieves higher data rates than single-input and single-output (SISO)-OFDM for all the ranges of \u03b8\u00bd of the \u03bcLEDs under study. However, the BER performance of OSM-OFDM is worse than in the case of SISO-OFDM. The maximum achievable data rate in OSM-OFDM is 1.34 Gb/s and 1.17 Gb/s in SISO-OFDM for \u03b8\u00bd of 2.27\u00b0 at a link distance of 1 m using adaptive data loading. The experimental results also show that due to the strongly correlated channels, the system performance is highly dependent on the \u03b8\u00bd of the \u03bcLEDs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247364","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247364.pdf","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental proof-of-concept of optical spatial modulation OFDM using micro LEDs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247364/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental proof-of-concept of optical spatial modulation OFDM using micro LEDs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454585","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247364/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental proof-of-concept of optical spatial modulation OFDM using micro LEDs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095548S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247365,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh V.

Transmitters, configured as multiple LED arrays, and multiple users equipped with multiple photodetectors (PD) are considered. The main challenge in such broadcast systems is the multi-user interference (MUI). In order to completely suppress the MUI, the block diagonalization (BD) precoding technique, originally utilized for radio frequency (RF) communications, will be adopted. Unlike RF counterpart the VLC signal is positive only leading to the modification of the precoding matrix, thus affecting the overall performance. The paper will investigate the lower bound for the sum-rate maximization of all users in the room scale scenario. Furthermore, the findings show that user's positions and PD's rotations considerably impact on the VLC system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247365.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1349","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-rate maximization of multi-user MIMO visible light communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Optical receivers","MIMO","Optical transmitters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO communication","photodetectors","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-rate maximization","multiuser MIMO visible light communications","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output visible light communications","indoor broadcast systems","VLC","multiple LED arrays","multiple photodetectors","multiuser interference","block diagonalization precoding technique","radio frequency communications","precoding matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLC","multi-user MIMO","precoding","sum-rate maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sum-rate maximization of multi-user MIMO visible light communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247365/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454511","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-rate maximization of multi-user MIMO visible light communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07556S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247367,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Stavridis","affiliation":["Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, School of Engineering The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Stavridis","id":"38260343100"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, School of Engineering The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247367","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":943},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Integrated optics","Optical modulation","MIMO","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","optical communication","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLC system","space modulation techniques","bit error rate","BER","multiple-input multiple-output visible light communication system","optical spatial modulation","OSM","optical generalized spatial modulation","OGeSM","optical multistream spatial modulation","OMS-SM","optical spatial multiplexing","OSMX","optical repetition coding","ORC","space modulation scheme","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of three major space modulation techniques in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Visible Light Communication (VLC) system is studied.

In this paper we introduce a novel approach for a self-correcting MIMO system's CSI that enables robustness against channel blocking and overcomes the reduced rank of the CSI matrix thanks to the self-estimation of the MIMO receiver position. This approach is designed to provide seamless MIMO VLC operation. The paper presents the theoretical modelling and numerical evaluation.

The effect of interference is important when analyzing aggregate performance of these systems. Just as signal to noise ratio (SNR) is used to evaluate link performance when disturbances are primarily related to noise, signal to interference ratio (SIR) and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) are metrics of interest for evaluation of systems in the presence of interference. For these metrics to be used interchangeably with SNR, interference should be Normally distributed. This assumption is valid in the presence of many interferers when the central limit theorem applies; however, directionality in VLC systems often leads to scenarios with dominant interferers. In this paper, we analyze the validity of the Gaussian assumption in VLC systems and show that the theoretical error rate can be distorted by 100\u00d7 or more when the assumption is erroneously observed. In addition, we define the distribution of commonly used VLC modulation schemes in relation to average optical power in order to provide fair comparison under constraints of the optical channel.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247376.pdf","endPage":"1415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical interference analysis in Visible Light Communication networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247376","startPage":"1410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optical interference analysis in Visible Light Communication networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247376/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454385","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247376/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical interference analysis in Visible Light Communication networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570092041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087104S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247377,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Bazzi","affiliation":["CNR-IEIIT, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Bazzi","id":"37552991200"},{"name":"Barbara M.

Short range vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside wireless communication technologies, such as IEEE 802.11p, are being foreseen for the offloading of cellular networks. A nearer breakthrough in this direction is represented by visible light communication (VLC), which can exploit light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the rear and head lights of vehicles to communicate with neighbors in visibility. In this paper, we investigate the impact of VLC between vehicles for data exchanging and cellular network offloading. Specifically, vehicles communicate through VLC and exploit traffic lights as road side units to collect information toward a remote control center. Results are given in terms of connectivity and percentage of packets transmitted through VLC and are obtained by means of a realistic simulation tool which takes into account real roads topology, realistic traffic traces, and the characteristics of the VLC protocol stack.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1421","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247377.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible light communications in vehicular networks for cellular offloading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247377/","displayDocTitle":"Visible light communications in vehicular networks for cellular offloading","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454527","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible light communications in vehicular networks for cellular offloading","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075786S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247378,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlu Wang","affiliation":["Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Yunlu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085462089"},{"name":"Dushyantha A.

Even though Li-Fi networks can provide extremely high data throughputs, the spatial distribution of such high data rates may not be uniform. It has been shown that this spatial data rate fluctuations can be successfully reduced by a RF network augmented to the Li-Fi network. In this study, a dynamic load balancing algorithm is proposed to find the optimum access point (AP) assignment in order to satisfy certain average per user data rate constraints while achieving minimum outage performance. Furthermore, a data rate threshold is defined to identify whether users should be served by a Li-Fi AP or a RF AP. The simulation results show that this threshold has a significant effect on the outage performance of the hybrid network. The results further show that the optimum threshold which achieves the minimal outage probability is much lower than the per user data rate requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247378","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247378.pdf","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic load balancing for hybrid Li-Fi and RF indoor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247378/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic load balancing for hybrid Li-Fi and RF indoor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247378/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic load balancing for hybrid Li-Fi and RF indoor networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087082S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247379,"authors":[{"name":"John Fakidis","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Fakidis","id":"37085450271"},{"name":"Stepan Kucera","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Stepan","lastName":"Kucera"},{"name":"Holger Claussen","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Blanchardstown Business & Technology Park Dublin 15, Ireland"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Claussen","id":"37270627500"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37085360462"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247379","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247379","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Optical transmitters","Laser beams","Integrated optics","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","optical links","radiofrequency power transmission","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser diodes","aspheric lenses","energy harvesting","wireless power transmission","wireless power supply","wireless backhaul communication","heterogeneous cellular networks","free space optical link","small cell backhaul communication"]}],"abstract":"The concept of small cells (SCs) is widely acknowledged for its significant benefits in energy efficiency and capacity of heterogeneous cellular networks. However, a large scale outdoor installation of SCs is limited by cost factors. Therefore, wireless backhaul communication and wireless power supply to SCs could significantly reduce deployment costs. The focus of this paper is on the investigation of the use of free space optical (FSO) links for power transfer to SCs in an indoor environment. In particular, an experimental design of a red light link for wireless power transmission (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH) is presented in the absence of ambient light. The transmitter includes up to five laser diodes (LDs) with a typical output optical power of 50mW per LD. Light collimation is achieved by the use of aspheric lenses. The receiver comprises a crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar panel placed at 5.2m from the optical transmitter. The use of five pairs of LDs and lenses results in a maximum harvested power of 10.4mW. This study shows that the number of optical transmitters required for the generation of an electrical power of 1W (demanded for the operation of a SC) from the solar panel is estimated to be 110.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247379","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247379.pdf","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of a free space optical link for small cell backhaul communication and power supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the design of a free space optical link for small cell backhaul communication and power supply","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454464","htmlLink":"/document/7247379/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of a free space optical link for small cell backhaul communication and power supply","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089048S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247387,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Morozs","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, Heslington, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Morozs","id":"37085472553"},{"name":"Tim Clarke","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, Heslington, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37290389500"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, Heslington, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247387","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Convergence","Joints","Interference","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","belief networks","cellular radio","convergence","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","radio spectrum management","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent dynamic spectrum access algorithm convergence analysis","reinforcement learning convergence properties analysis","RL convergence properties analysis","distributed Q-learning DSA algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation","probabilistic analysis","joint policy transitions","Markov chain","Bayesian network model","cellular system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Reinforcement Learning","Bayesian Networks","Dynamic Spectrum Access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian network based model for analysing convergence properties of reinforcement learning (RL) based dynamic spectrum access (DSA) algorithms.

Spectrum regulators and technical specification bodies are contemplating over the idea of allowing commercial wireless systems to be deployed in satellite bands on a sharing basis. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed to deploy small cells in the 3.5 GHz satellite band. In this paper, we consider deployment of small cells in satellite bands and address opportunities and challenges that are associated with such a deployment. We focus on the conventional and extended C-band fixed satellite service (FSS) receiving earth stations. We show that small cell operation can result in out-of-band emission and low noise amplifier (LNA) saturation issues for FSS systems. Exclusion zones are required to protect FSS systems. We show that exclusion zones are quite larger when small cells are deployed outdoors as compared to the case when small cells are deployed indoors. Therefore, we propose that small cells should be deployed indoors for the scenarios where FSS systems are geographically colocated. This results in maximum utilization of small cell technology and minimum exclusion zones required to protect FSS receiving earth stations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247408","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247408.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing between small cells and satellites: Opportunities and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247408/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing between small cells and satellites: Opportunities and challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454392","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247408/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing between small cells and satellites: Opportunities and challenges","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057826S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247410,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Zhu","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication research Center, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085634864"},{"name":"Takeo Fujii","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication research Center, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247410","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Feature extraction","Cognitive radio","Time-frequency analysis","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","phase shift keying","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terrestrial system","satellite system","modulation classification","cognitive radios","signal detection probability","interference canceler","multi-system detection technique","satcomm downlink","PSK modulation","QAM modulation","Pseudo Wigner-Ville time-frequency distribution"]}],"abstract":"In order to realize improving signal detection probability using interference canceler and multi-system detection techniques in spectrum sharing environment in cognitive radio of satellite and terrestrial system, it is required to classify the digital modulation type in an environment without handshaking between the transmitter and receiver. The previous methods can hardly classify modulation type precisely unless high SNR (signal power to noise power ratio) is provided, which is barely possible to meet in satcomm downlink. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel method to achieve the classification of QAM and PSK modulation, which are popular modulation types being used for satellite communications. The features of phase and amplitude are extracted by Pseudo Wigner-Ville time-frequency distribution. With the feature obtained above, simulation results indicated that this method offers an accurate classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247410","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247410.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247410","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation classification in cognitive radios for satellite and terrestrial systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modulation classification in cognitive radios for satellite and terrestrial systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247410/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454579","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation classification in cognitive radios for satellite and terrestrial systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570083353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1629S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247411,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Pierucci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Pierucci","id":"37284659400"},{"name":"Romano Fantacci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Romano","lastName":"Fantacci","id":"37085497073"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247411","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Cognitive radio","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","MIMO communication","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO cooperative spectrum sensing","hybrid satellite scenario","hybrid terrestrial scenario","multiple-input multiple-output technology","cooperative cognitive radio scheme","spectrum sharing","multiple antenna","energy detector","coordination center","CR node","signal to noise ratio","SNR","primary user","secondary user"]}],"abstract":"In a hybrid satellite/terrestrial scenario, the paper analyzes the advantages of using a cooperative scheme combined with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technologies at each cognitive radio (CR) node for spectrum sensing. In the proposed scenario, the satellite and the terrestrial components use the same band (primary users) and a group of secondary users (sensors or mobile users) want to dynamically share the spectrum without harmful interference on primary user (PU). The satellite can also report measures provided by the group of secondary users to a remote center in an area where the mobile coverage it is difficult to extend or for emergency situations. The joint use of multiple antennas at each CR node and cooperative cognitive radio scheme is analyzed to improve the performance of the conventional energy detector (ED) and to increase the reliability in PU detection. A coordination center (CC) takes the final decision based on the detections carried out by all the CRS. Moreover, the CC can manage a strategy to allow equal and fare share of the radio resources to the group of CR nodes. The use of improved energy detector based on the average power of received samples is also analyzed. Simulation results show that the use of cooperation and MIMO technologies improves the detection even at low value of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and a trade off-it is necessary among the number of multiple antennas, the number of samples and the spectrum usage efficiency and the level of interference on the PU.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247411","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO cooperative spectrum sensing in hybrid satellite/terrestrial scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO cooperative spectrum sensing in hybrid satellite/terrestrial scenario","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247411/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454557","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247411/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO cooperative spectrum sensing in hybrid satellite/terrestrial scenario","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060129S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247413,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Fayazur Rahaman","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Mohammad Fayazur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37085701204"},{"name":"Mohammed Zafar Ali Khan","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, IN"],"firstName":"Mohammed Zafar Ali","lastName":"Khan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247413","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Probability density function","Cognitive radio","Conferences","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","truncated SED","truncated sequential energy detector","cognitive radio","average number-of-sample reduction","detection process","tolerable error limits","sequential thresholds","probability distribution functions","PDF","test statistic values","fixed sample size","FSS","spectrum sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Truncated","Sequential","Energy Detection","Cognitive Radio","False Alarm","Miss Detection","Thresholds","Spectrum Sensing","Wide Coverage Area"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the average number of samples (ASN) required by the Truncated Sequential Energy Detector (TSED) for Cognitive Radio.

In order to acquire more spectrum resources, malicious secondary users (SUs) always launch various attacks. Among these attacks, spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack is a typical one. To cope with SSDF attacks, this paper proposes a three-layer Bayesian model. History data is processed through three layers, namely processing layer, integrating layer and inferring layer. Processing layer is modeled by hidden Markov model (HMM), which uses original data to train parameters and then provide trained emission distributions to the second layer. Within integrating layer, on the basis of different algorithms, emission distributions are processed to obtain the reputation values, balance values and specificity values of different SUs. By using different thresholds, these continuous values can be made discrete and then transferred to inferring layer. In the third layer, a Bayesian network (BN) is built to calculate the safety probabilities of SUs via using the discrete values as evidence. From simulation results, the proposed system is useful to defend against different types of malicious users, especially in low-SNR situations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1645","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247415.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-layer Bayesian model based spectrum sensing to detect malicious attacks in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247415/","displayDocTitle":"Three-layer Bayesian model based spectrum sensing to detect malicious attacks in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454609","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-layer Bayesian model based spectrum sensing to detect malicious attacks in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077339S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247416,"authors":[{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Shree Krishna","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38489086200"},{"name":"Eva Lagunas","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Lagunas","id":"37972945800"},{"name":"Sina Maleki","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Maleki","id":"38556743500"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Joel Grotz","affiliation":["Technical Labs, Newtec, Belgium"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Grotz","id":"37547196200"},{"name":"Jens Krause","affiliation":["SES, Betzdorf, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Krause","id":"37544733300"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247416","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Interference","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microwave links","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","cognitive satellite communications","Ka-band","SatCom","cognitive downlink access","geostationary fixed satellite service terminals","GEO FSS terminals","fixed-service microwave links","FS microwave links","efficient receive beamforming technique","carrier allocation","cognitive exploitation framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive SatCom","Carrier Allocation","Beamforming","Resource Allocation","Ka-band"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of resource allocation in the context of cognitive Satellite Communications (SatCom). In particular, we focus on the cognitive downlink access by Geostationary (GEO) Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) terminals in the band 17.7-19.7 GHz, where the incumbent users are Fixed-Service (FS) microwave links. Assuming a multiple Low Noise Block Converter (LNB) satellite receiver at the cognitive FSS terminal-side, an efficient receive beamforming technique combined with carrier allocation is proposed in order to maximize the overall downlink throughput as well as to improve the beam availability. The proposed cognitive exploitation framework allows the flexibility of using non-exclusive spectrum for the FSS downlink system, thus improving the overall system throughput. More importantly, the proposed approach is validated with the help of numerical results considering realistic system parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for cognitive Satellite Communications in Ka-band (17.7\u201319.7 GHz)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247416","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247416.pdf","startPage":"1646","endPage":"1651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for cognitive Satellite Communications in Ka-band (17.7\u201319.7 GHz)","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247416/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454424","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for cognitive Satellite Communications in Ka-band (17.7\u201319.7 GHz)","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570081963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071231S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247417,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Icolari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Icolari","id":"37085390099"},{"name":"Daniele Tarchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Tarchi","id":"37275997700"},{"name":"Alessandro Guidotti","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Guidotti"},{"name":"Alessandro Vanelli Coralli","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Alessandro Vanelli","lastName":"Coralli"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247417","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Color","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam pattern allocation strategies","satellite cognitive radio systems","future wireless communication technologies","spectrum sharing","wireless terrestrial communications","multibeam satellite systems","optimization strategy","quality index"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam pattern allocation strategies for satellite cognitive radio systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","endPage":"1657","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247417","startPage":"1652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247417","abstract":"One of the major enabler for future wireless communication technologies is spectrum sharing, allowing to effectively share spectrum portions among different services.

Signals are received by masked destination earth station (ES) with the help of a relaying ES, situated at the ground with good line-of-sight. No direct transmission is possible from the satellite to the destination ES. The satellite-relay ES link is assumed to be Shadowed-Rician fading, and relay ES-destination ES (terrestrial link) is assumed to follow Nakagami-m fading. We propose a scheme for channel estimation and detection of channel gains and transmitted signal from the satellite. The estimation of terrestrial-link is performed separately, whereas, the channel estimation of cooperative hybrid link (satellite-relay ES-destination ES) and symbol detection is performed jointly. The average symbol error rate of the considered system for M-ary phase shift keying constellation is derived by using moment generating function (M.G.F.) approach. Moreover, the analytical diversity order of the considered system with estimated channel gains is also derived. It is shown by simulation and analysis that the diversity order of the system is not affected by the estimation errors. By using the expression of M.G.F., the average capacity of the system is also derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440583","htmlLink":"/document/7247422/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Imperfect CSI based AF relaying in hybrid satellite-terrestrial cooperative communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imperfect CSI based AF relaying in hybrid satellite-terrestrial cooperative communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570084157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073823S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247433,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Floris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Floris","id":"38518098900"},{"name":"Luigi Atzori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Atzori","id":"37268190400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247433","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":984},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia communication","Vehicles","Quality of service","Quality assessment","Synchronization","Sensors","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","multimedia communication","protocols","quality of experience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of experience","multimedia Internet of Things","QoE","Internet of Things","IoT architecture","MIoT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quality of Experience","Internet of Things"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a first approach for evaluating the Quality of Experience (QoE) for IoT (Internet of Things) applications is presented.

DASH streaming provides seamless playback by adapting the video quality to the network conditions during the video playback. A DASH server supports adaptive streaming by hosting multiple representations of the video and each representation is divided into small segments of equal playback duration. At the client end, the video player uses an adaptive bitrate selection (ABR) algorithm to decide the bitrate to be selected for each segment depending on the current network conditions. Currently, proposed ABR algorithms ignore the fact that the segment sizes significantly vary for a given video bitrate. Due to this, even though an ABR algorithm is able to measure the network bandwidth, it may fail to predict the time to download the next segment In this paper, we propose a segment-aware rate adaptation (SARA) algorithm that considers the segment size variation in addition to the estimated path bandwidth and the current buffer occupancy to accurately predict the time required to download the next segment We also developed an open source Python based emulated DASH video player, that was used to compare the performance of SARA and a basic ABR. Our results show that SARA provides a significant gain over the basic algorithm in the video quality delivered, without noticeably impacting the video switching rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SARA: Segment aware rate adaptation algorithm for dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247436","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247436.pdf","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"SARA: Segment aware rate adaptation algorithm for dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247436/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454401","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SARA: Segment aware rate adaptation algorithm for dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102588S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247453,"authors":[{"name":"Ala' Darabseh","affiliation":["Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Ala'","lastName":"Darabseh","id":"37085568364"},{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub","affiliation":["Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Ayyoub","id":"38271803700"},{"name":"Yaser Jararweh","affiliation":["Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Yaser","lastName":"Jararweh","id":"37322599600"},{"name":"Elhadj Benkhelifa","affiliation":["Mobile Fusion Applied Research Centre, Staffordshire University, Stafford, UK"],"firstName":"Elhadj","lastName":"Benkhelifa","id":"37706082100"},{"name":"Mladen Vouk","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Vouk","id":"37063796800"},{"name":"Andy Rindos","affiliation":["IBM Corporation, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Rindos","id":"37353082200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247453","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"abstract":"The emerging Software Defined Systems (SDSys) is a recent paradigm, which has been introduced to reduce the overhead in the control and management operations of complex computing systems. The main concept behind this technology is around isolating the data plane from the control plane. Traditional security mechanisms are facing more challenges in providing sufficient levels of protection and efficiency. SDSys for security has been proposed to address these challenges. Software Defined Security (SDSec) provides a flexible and centralized security solution by abstracting the security mechanisms from the hardware layer to a software layer. In this paper we present a novel experimental framework to provide a novel virtualized testbed environment for SDSec systems. This work builds on the Mininet simulator, where its core components, the host, switch and the controller, are customized to build the proposed experimental simulation framework for SDSec. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first experimental framework and simulator for SDSec solutions. The developed simulator, will not only support the development and testing of SDSecurity solutions, it will also serve as an experimentation tool for researchers and for benchmarking purposes. The developed simulator could also be used as an educational tool to train students and novice researchers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247453.pdf","startPage":"1871","endPage":"1876","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDSecurity: A Software Defined Security experimental framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Switches","Computer crime","Hardware","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network security","software defined networking","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDSecurity","software defined security experimental framework","software defined systems","SDSys","complex computing system management operations","complex computing system control","centralized security solution","security mechanisms","virtualized testbed environment","SDSec systems","Mininet simulator","experimental simulation framework","SDSecurity solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"SDSecurity: A Software Defined Security experimental framework","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247453/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454440","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SDSecurity: A Software Defined Security experimental framework","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570092185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088645S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247469,"authors":[{"name":"Dang Khoa Nguyen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Dang Khoa","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085444465"},{"name":"Michail Matthaiou","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, U.K.","Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Matthaiou","id":"37396192400"},{"name":"Trung Q.

Closed-form expressions for OP and throughput of the network are derived in the context of delay-limited transmission. Numerical results corroborate our analysis, thereby we can quantify the degradation of OP and throughput of TWCR networks due to transceiver hardware impairments. Under the specific parameters, our results indicate that the MABC protocol achieves asymptotically a higher throughput by 0.65 [bits/s/Hz] than the TDBC protocol, while the DS energy transfer scheme offers better performance than the SFS policy for both relaying protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247469","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247469.pdf","startPage":"1970","endPage":"1975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF energy harvesting two-way cognitive DF relaying with transceiver impairments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"RF energy harvesting two-way cognitive DF relaying with transceiver impairments","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247469/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454423","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF energy harvesting two-way cognitive DF relaying with transceiver impairments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570091935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055279S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247479,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Zhang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085638713"},{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Han","id":"37537329600"},{"name":"Di Li","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Li","id":"37085548830"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37077763100"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085520847"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247479","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hidden Markov models","Markov processes","Energy harvesting","Energy states","Yttrium","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","hidden Markov models","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional sensing","energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","spectrum access","power consumption patterns","spectrum sensing accuracy","Markovian behavior","hidden input Markov model","cognitive primary user detection problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Energy Harvesting","Spectrum Sensing","Hidden Markov Model","Power Sensing","2-D Sensing"]}],"abstract":"Energy harvester based cognitive radio is a promising solution to address the shortage of both spectrum and energy. Since the spectrum access and power consumption patterns are interdependent, and the power value harvested from certain environmental sources are spatially correlated, the new power dimension could provide additional information to enhance the spectrum sensing accuracy. In this paper, the Markovian behavior of the primary users is considered, based on which we adopt a hidden input Markov model to specify the primary vs. secondary dynamics in the system. Accordingly, we propose a 2-D spectrum and power (harvested) sensing scheme to improve the primary user detection performance, which is also capable of estimating the primary transmit power level. Theoretical and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, in term of the performance gain achieved by considering the new power dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly consider the spectrum and power dimensions for the cognitive primary user detection problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247479","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247479.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247479","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","startPage":"2029","endPage":"2034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional sensing in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional sensing in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247479/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454496","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional sensing in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570081793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083751S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247482,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Ivanov","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"38666263400"},{"name":"Fredrik Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","id":"37283169100"},{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Alexandre Graell i","lastName":"Amat"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, DK"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247482","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247482","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Media Access Protocol","Receivers","Approximation methods","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","carrier sense multiple access","probability","telecommunication congestion control","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-to-all broadcast protocol","vehicular network","coded slotted ALOHA","periodic message","CSA","half-duplex mode","probability","packet decoding","carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance","multiple access protocol"]}],"abstract":"We propose an uncoordinated all-to-all broadcast protocol for periodic messages in vehicular networks based on coded slotted ALOHA (CSA). Unlike classical CSA, each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. As in CSA, each user transmits its packet several times. The half-duplex mode gives rise to an interesting design trade-off: the more the user repeats its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other users, but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from others. We compare the proposed protocol with carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance, currently adopted as a multiple access protocol for vehicular networks. The results show that the proposed protocol greatly increases the number of users in the network that reliably communicate with each other. We also provide analytical tools to predict the performance of the proposed protocol.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247482","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247482.pdf","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-to-all broadcast for vehicular networks based on coded slotted ALOHA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"All-to-all broadcast for vehicular networks based on coded slotted ALOHA","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247482/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454601","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247482/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-to-all broadcast for vehicular networks based on coded slotted ALOHA","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570082217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060796S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7247484,"authors":[{"name":"Sriharsha Madala","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Sriharsha","lastName":"Madala","id":"37085661136"},{"name":"Krishna Narayanan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37265356000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247484","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"abstract":"The achievable rate region of a K-user Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) is well known.

Some candidate solutions are based on Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DS-SS) combined with a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) demodulator, but the performance of these techniques is highly related to the distribution of the users received power. In that context, this paper presents a theoretical analysis to calculate the optimum user SINR profile at the decoder maximizing the spectral efficiency in bps/Hz for a specific modulation and practical Forward Error Correction (FEC) code. This solution is achieved by means of Variational Calculus operating in the asymptotic large-user case. Although a constant SINR function has been typically assumed in the literature (the one maximizing capacity), the theoretical results evidence that the optimum SINR profile must be an increasing function of the users received power. Its performance is compared with that of the uniform profile for two representative scenarios with different channel codes in a slightly overloaded system. The numerical results show that the optimum solution regulates the network load preventing the aggregate throughput from collapsing when the system is overloaded. In scenarios with a large number of transmitters, this optimum solution can be implemented in an uncoordinated manner with the knowledge of a few public system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247485","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2068","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247485.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR profile for spectral efficiency optimization of SIC receivers in the many-user regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"SINR profile for spectral efficiency optimization of SIC receivers in the many-user regime","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247485/","accessionNumber":"15440625","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247485/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR profile for spectral efficiency optimization of SIC receivers in the many-user regime","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05999S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247489,"authors":[{"name":"Gabor Hannak","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Hannak","id":"37085494331"},{"name":"Martin Mayer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37085591489"},{"name":"Alexander Jung","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Jung","id":"37642424900"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"},{"name":"Norbert Goertz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Goertz","id":"37295153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247489","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":729},"abstract":"We consider overloaded (non-orthogonal) code division multiple access multiuser wireless communication systems with many transmitting users and one central aggregation node, a typical scenario in e.g. machine-to-machine communications. The task of the central node is to detect the set of active devices and separate their data streams, whose number at any time instance is relatively small compared to the total number of devices in the system. We introduce a novel two-step detection procedure: the first step involves the simultaneous transmission of a pilot sequence used for identification of the active devices and the estimation of their respective channel coefficients. In the second step the payload is transmitted by all active devices and received synchronously at the central node. The first step reduces to a compressed sensing (CS) problem due to the relatively small number of simultaneously active devices. Using an efficient CS recovery scheme (approximate message passing), joint activity detection and channel estimation with high reliability is possible, even for extremely large-scale systems. This, in turn, reduces the data detection task to a simple overdetermined system of linear equations that is then solved by classical methods in the second step.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247489.pdf","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2091","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and activity detection for multiuser communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Multiaccess communication","Receivers","Compressed sensing","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","compressed sensing","message passing","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","joint activity detection","overloaded code division multiple access communication systems","multiuser wireless communication systems","machine-to-machine communications","central node","data streams","simultaneous pilot sequence transmission","active device identification","channel coefficient estimation","payload transmission","compressed sensing problem","CS recovery scheme","approximate message passing","data detection task reduction","linear equations system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and activity detection for multiuser communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247489/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454469","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and activity detection for multiuser communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099679S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247492,"authors":[{"name":"Han Seung Jang","affiliation":["KAIST, School of Electrical Engineering, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Han Seung","lastName":"Jang","id":"37085727080"},{"name":"Su Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea Polytechnic University, Siheung, Korea"],"firstName":"Su Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085352963"},{"name":"Hong-Shik Park","affiliation":["KAIST, School of Electrical Engineering, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Shik","lastName":"Park","id":"37085411164"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["KAIST, School of Electrical Engineering, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247492","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation error","Delays","Indexes","Conferences","Access protocols","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","delay estimation","error statistics","probability","radionavigation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial group based random access","SGRA scheme","future cellular M2M communication","machine node","distance estimation method","eNodeB","distance estimation error","distance moment","group-mismatch problem","RA collision probability","delay","group reselection solution","shared distance solution"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed a spatial group based random access (SGRA) scheme which is a novel RA scheme to effectively increase the number of available preambles for future cellular M2M communications. In the SGRA scheme, a machine node in the cell should determine its own spatial group (SG) by estimating the distance between the eNodeB and itself through any distance estimation methods. At the moment, the distance estimation error may inevitably occur in the distance estimation and may cause a group-mismatch problem, which affects the performance of the SGRA scheme in terms of RA collision probability and delay. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a group-reselection solution and a shared distance solution in order to resolve the group-mismatch problem in the SGRA scheme. Through numerical results, it is shown that the combination of the proposed solutions provides a significant robustness against the distance estimation errors, which leads to accommodating a significantly larger number of machine nodes with very lower collision probabilities and shorter average RA delay in more practical M2M deployment environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced spatial group based random access for cellular M2M communications","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247492","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247492.pdf","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced spatial group based random access for cellular M2M communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247492/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454660","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced spatial group based random access for cellular M2M communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07685S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247494,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Paolini","affiliation":["CNIT, University of Bologna, Cesena, FC, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Paolini","id":"37392092900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247494","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Bipartite graph","Decoding","Access protocols","Error analysis","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","error statistics","interference suppression","Monte Carlo methods","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite length analysis","irregular repetition slotted ALOHA access protocol","successive interference cancellation decoding","channel model","collision channel","error probability","upper bound","check node","IRSA scheme","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247494","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247494.pdf","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247494","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite length analysis of irregular repetition slotted Aloha (IRSA) access protocols","abstract":"In this paper the error rate of irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) access protocols, under successive interference cancellation decoding, is analyzed for a finite number of active users and in a finite frame length setting.

Monte Carlo simulations exhibit a very good match with the proposed analytical tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247494/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454656","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Finite length analysis of irregular repetition slotted Aloha (IRSA) access protocols","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite length analysis of irregular repetition slotted Aloha (IRSA) access protocols","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110093S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7247496,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Hynek","affiliation":["Czech Technical University in Prague"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Hynek","id":"38017422600"},{"name":"David Halls","affiliation":["Toshiba - Telecommunications Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Halls","id":"37320830200"},{"name":"Jan Sykora","affiliation":["Czech Technical University in Prague"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Sykora","id":"37284752600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247496","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Synchronization","Wireless communication","Phase shift keying","Transmitters","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed learning algorithm","mapping selection","wireless physical layer network coding","wireless relay node","network relays","source data","mapping assignment","non-cooperative game-based process","WPLNC mapping","software defined radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding","distributed decision making","software defined radio"]}],"abstract":"A wireless relay node employing Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding (WPLNC) must use a specific mapping in order to combine incoming signals. This mapping, however, cannot be selected arbitrarily. Together with the signals from the other network relays, it has to allow the destinations to be able to recover the source data from the available observations. Moreover the mapping should optimize a local relay utility function. This task can be easily solved in centralized networks. In decentralized ones, such as sensor or smart metering networks, a mapping assignment should be derived from mutual node communication, cooperation and/or signaling. In this paper we focus on the practical hardware implementation of such a distributed algorithm called a Distributed Learning Algorithm (DLA). In a two source, two relay and two destination network scenario we have implemented a non-cooperative game-based process that selects the WPLNC mapping of each individual relay node guaranteeing invertibility of WPLNC at the destinations as well as optimizing the relay's utility function, namely the output modulation cardinality. The implementation testbed is based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) modules and it is used to verify the algorithm properties in real-world conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247496","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of Distributed Learning Algorithm for mapping selection for Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of Distributed Learning Algorithm for mapping selection for Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247496/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440594","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247496/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of Distributed Learning Algorithm for mapping selection for Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055213S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247497,"authors":[{"name":"Changming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

However, phase noise is significant due to the high oscillation frequency, which affects channel estimation and deteriorates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. This paper emphasizes that phase noise may be estimated in the frequency domain, and a scheme with iterative channel estimation and phase noise compensation is proposed for single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) based mmWave systems. We achieve channel estimation by calculating small perturbations iteratively with the first-order approximation. For signal demodulation, we adopt an iterative receiver to compensate phase noise with the decision feedback result. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves competitive performance and outperforms the traditional methods, in terms of both mean square error (MSE) in channel estimation and BER in signal demodulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2138","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247497.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative channel estimation and phase noise compensation for SC-FDE based mmWave systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Channel estimation","Frequency-domain analysis","Receivers","Demodulation","Time-domain analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","error statistics","iterative methods","mean square error methods","phase noise","radio networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative channel estimation","phase noise compensation","mmWave systems","SC-FDE","wireless networks","directional transmissions","oscillation frequency","channel estimation","bit-error-rate","BER","phase noise","single carrier frequency domain equalization","signal demodulation","first-order approximation","iterative receiver","compensate phase noise","mean square error","MSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter-wave systems","SC-FDE","phase noise","channel estimation","iterative receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Iterative channel estimation and phase noise compensation for SC-FDE based mmWave systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247497/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247497/","accessionNumber":"15454462","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative channel estimation and phase noise compensation for SC-FDE based mmWave systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077462S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247499,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoke Qi","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation"],"firstName":"Xiaoke","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085415850"},{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["Department of College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, ShenZhen Univeristy"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085643383"},{"name":"Kaishun Wu","affiliation":["Department of College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, ShenZhen Univeristy"],"firstName":"Kaishun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404409500"},{"name":"Jianhua Tao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Tao","id":"37085634328"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247499","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Reliability","Bit error rate","Error probability","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Receivers","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super dense wireless networks","smart pilot","wireless communication","dense-deployed wireless networks","interference signal","partial packet recovery protocols","adaptive hard pilot","reliable soft pilot","wireless local area networks","WLAN"]}],"abstract":"Wireless communication is prone to partial packet due to the complex behavior of wireless signal propagation, especially in the dense-deployed wireless networks, where the interference signal is unavoidable. Such packet often contains a few errors, yet has to be retransmitted due to decoding failure. To avoid redundant transmission, partial packet recovery protocols are leveraged to identify and retransmit the corrupted portion instead of the entire packet. However, the information they obtained is limited. In this paper, we investigate two kinds of pilots termed smart pilots to achieve more efficient partial packet recovery. Smart pilot incorporates two novel ideas: (1) Adaptive Hard Pilot that inserts known bits to help recovery the corrupted packet according to the retransmission scheme, and (2) Reliable Soft Pilot that utilizes the confidence information to accurately identify the corrupted portion for retransmission. With these two smart pilots, the receiver is able to recovery more partial packet, and thus the required retransmission portion is greatly reduced.

We show the bound of the proposed system and confirm an achievable point using practical coding. We also evaluate the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed technique via computer simulations. The results indicate that even though with the offered traffic of 1.11 packets/slot, reliable communications is achievable.

In this paper, we extend this strategy to the case in which a set of user pairs communicate via a cluster of intermediary amplify-and-forward relaying nodes. We obtain an upper bound on the outage probability of the network, and a closed-form expression for the multiuser contention probability (the probability that distinct user pairs select the same relay). Consequently, we are able to construct an upper bound on the failure probability of the network, i.e., the probability that either an outage or contention occurs. We show that there exists a critical average end-to-end SNR, above which the outage probability decays exponentially with the number of available relays. In this case, the network failure probability is dominated by the contention probability. Many of our results are of a fundamental (asymptotic) nature, but key results are verified with simulations and illustrated numerically for finite system sizes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined bulk and per-tone relay selection in super dense wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247508","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247508.pdf","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combined bulk and per-tone relay selection in super dense wireless networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247508/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440595","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined bulk and per-tone relay selection in super dense wireless networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154874S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247509,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Vasudeva","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Vasudeva","id":"37085487052"},{"name":"Meryem \u015eimsek","affiliation":["Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"],"firstName":"Meryem","lastName":"\u015eimsek"},{"name":"David L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Ireland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"\u0130smail G\u00fcven\u00e7","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL"],"firstName":"\u0130smail","lastName":"G\u00fcven\u00e7","id":"37085348460"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247509","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Hafnium","Fading","Analytical models","Mobile radio mobility management","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","radiowave propagation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel fading","heterogeneous networks","handover decisions","signal measurements","user equipment","radio propagation channel","handover failure","key mobility management parameters","3GPP-compliant heterogeneous network simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3GPP","Bertrand's paradox","handover","heterogeneous network (HetNet)","mobility management","LTE","radio link failure (RLF)","time to trigger (TTT)"]}],"abstract":"Handover decisions and mobility management in modern communication networks are carried out using signal measurements taken at user equipment (UE), obtained from neighboring base stations.

We introduce a simple geometric model to analyze handover failure as a function of key mobility management parameters. Relevant fading statistics are extracted from a 3GPP-compliant heterogeneous network simulator, and a semi-analytic approach is followed to obtain the handover failure performance of a mobile UE.

Short block length LDPC codes avoid the large processing latency incurred by the large block lengths classically considered for this class of codes, making them a potential candidate for next generation wireless communications systems. In this paper, a novel informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) approach for decoding LDPC codes is developed based on the use of the current message reliabilities and the residuals of the potential updates to select the messages passed in the graph during iterative Sum Product decoding. An alternative measure of the iteration of the IDS schemes is also proposed which highlights the high cost of those algorithms in terms of processing complexity and motivates the development of the proposed approach.

Both approaches rely on increasing the number of access elements per user, either through deploying more access nodes over an area or increasing the number of antenna elements per access node. At the network-level, optimal user-association for a densely and randomly deployed network of Massive MIMO empowered access nodes must account for both channel and load conditions. In this paper we formulate this complex problem, report its computationally intractability and reformulate it to a plausible form, amenable to acquire a global optimal solution with reasonable complexity.

Unfortunately, Network MIMO requires global channel state information (CSI) at all transmitters, hence places stringent requirements on backhaul rate and even more on latency. As a solution, this paper investigates an emerging design philosophy for CSI that exploits the broadcast nature of wireless which is well suited to dense networks. In our design, feedback is broadcast from each terminal and decoded opportunistically by any overhearing base station which in turn must design opportunistic interference-cancelling precoders. The corresponding precoder design is shown to be equivalent to a decentralized decision problem whose general solution is challenging, yet for which heuristic schemes can be derived. The obtained algorithms are able to capitalize on the opportunistic feedback without the need for global CSI sharing.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247517","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247517.pdf","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic feedback mechanisms for decentralized Network MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247517/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic feedback mechanisms for decentralized Network MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247517/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic feedback mechanisms for decentralized Network MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128502S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247519,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Matth\u00e9","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Matth\u00e9","id":"37085424897"},{"name":"Luciano Leonel Mendes","affiliation":["Inatel"],"firstName":"Luciano Leonel","lastName":"Mendes","id":"37299801900"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247519","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247519","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Time-frequency analysis","Receivers","Interference","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","radiofrequency interference","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous multiuser uplink transmission","generalized frequency division multiplexing","GFDM","wireless sensor networks","WSN","interuser interference","IUI","OFDM","data aided phase error estimation","compensation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","GFDM","Channel Estimation","Interference"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous multi-user uplink transmission with generalized frequency division multiplexing","startPage":"2269","endPage":"2275","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247519.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247519","abstract":"This paper investigates the applicability of generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) for an uplink scenario where several users are not perfectly synchronized, as it appears in wireless sensor networks (WSN).

Since LTE uses a TDMA/OFDMA scheduled approach, coexisting WiFi networks may face starvation if the channel is fully occupied by LTE-U transmissions. In this paper we derive a novel proportional fair allocation scheme that ensures fair coexistence between LTE-U and WiFi. Importantly, we find that the proportional fair allocation is qualitatively different from previously considered WiFi-only settings and that since the resulting allocation requires only quite limited knowledge of network parameters it is potentially easy to implement in practice, without the need for message-passing between heterogeneous networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Resource management","Throughput","Base stations","Optimization","Artificial neural networks","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","message passing","OFDM modulation","time division multiple access","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportional fair allocation scheme","unlicensed bands","LTE networks","TDMA-OFDMA scheduled approach","WiFi networks","message-passing","heterogeneous networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE Unlicensed","LTE-U","LAA-LTE","WiFi","coexistence","proportional fairness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247522","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247522","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247522","startPage":"2288","endPage":"2293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence of WiFi and LTE in unlicensed bands: A proportional fair allocation scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence of WiFi and LTE in unlicensed bands: A proportional fair allocation scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247522/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247522/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454472","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence of WiFi and LTE in unlicensed bands: A proportional fair allocation scheme","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570076375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078152S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247523,"authors":[{"name":"Andra M.

However, LTE-U would interfere with other legacy technologies operating in the unlicensed band, the most important being contention-based Wi-Fi, which would be blocked by conventional LTE, which is designed for dedicated licensed spectrum. Consequently, some coexistence-enabling mechanisms have been proposed for LTE-U, but their evaluation is still at an early stage. In this paper we present a detailed system-level study on the downlink throughput performance of legacy indoor IEEE 802.11n and LTE-U deployments coexisting in the 5 GHz band. We consider several LTE-U coexistence mechanisms (i.e. listen-before-talk and interference-aware channel selection) in indoor LTE-U femtocell and outdoor LTE-U picocell scenarios with a realistic range of network densities and real outdoor picocell locations. We also study coexistence of LTE-U networks deployed by multiple operators, and evaluate the impact of different LTE-U transmit power levels. Our results show that in general both Wi-Fi and LTE-U benefit from the large number of available channels and isolation provided by building shielding at 5 GHz. Additionally, in typical indoor coexistence scenarios, interference-aware channel selection is more efficient for both Wi-Fi and LTE-U than listen-before-talk mechanisms. For outdoor LTE-U picocells and indoor Wi-Fi deployments, the two networks are isolated from each other, but listen-before-talk can increase LTE-U user throughput when multiple outdoor LTE-U networks deployed by different cellular operators coexist.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence of pico- and femto-cellular LTE-unlicensed with legacy indoor Wi-Fi deployments","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247523","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247523.pdf","startPage":"2294","endPage":"2300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence of pico- and femto-cellular LTE-unlicensed with legacy indoor Wi-Fi deployments","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247523/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15440584","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence of pico- and femto-cellular LTE-unlicensed with legacy indoor Wi-Fi deployments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570081727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076175S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247524,"authors":[{"name":"Shweta Sagari","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shweta","lastName":"Sagari","id":"38233005800"},{"name":"Ivan Seskar","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Seskar","id":"37274258300"},{"name":"Dipankar Raychaudhuri","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dipankar","lastName":"Raychaudhuri","id":"37274242800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247524","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":947},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247524","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Throughput","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Channel allocation","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","radio spectrum management","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi heterogeneous networks","LTE","mobile data demand","RF spectrum","dynamic spectrum sharing","radio technologies","analytical framework","interference characterization","single WiFi access points","carrier sense range"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiFi","LTE","HetNet","dynamic spectrum access","inter-network coordination","distributed CSMA"]}],"abstract":"Rapid increases in mobile data demand and inherently limited RF spectrum motivate the use of dynamic spectrum sharing between different radio technologies such as WiFi and LTE, most notably in small cell (HetNet) scenarios.

The first model developed is for single LTE and single WiFi access points separated by a specified distance. Results obtained for that model demonstrate the fact that WiFi is significantly degraded by a nearby LTE system, while LTE degradation is minimal as long as the WiFi system is within carrier sense range. A second model for multiple WiFi and multiple LTE systems further demonstrates the fact that LTE causes significant degradation to WiFi and that overall system throughput first increases and then decreases with growing density.

Nevertheless, coexistence among several LTE-U and/or Wi-Fi systems in the same band is a key technical challenge to be resolved. In this context, this paper focuses on the channel selection functionality for LTE-U enabled cells to decide the most appropriate channel to use for downlink traffic offloading in the unlicensed band. A distributed Q-learning mechanism that exploits prior experience is proposed to support this functionality, thus enabling coexistence with other systems in a smart and efficient way. The behavior of the proposed approach is illustrated in an indoor scenario with small cells from two different operators. A fully decentralized approach, where the channel selection decision-making is performed independently by each small cell in the scenario, is considered to initially assess the potentials of the Q-learning solution. Promising results are obtained revealing that the throughput achieved by the proposed approach can be between 96% and 99% of the optimum ideal achievable throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247525.pdf","startPage":"2307","endPage":"2313","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-based coexistence for LTE operation in unlicensed bands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Long Term Evolution","Throughput","Downlink","Time-domain analysis","Interference","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning-based coexistence","LTE-U","unlicensed band","Long Term Evolution","Wi-Fi system","downlink traffic offloading","distributed Q-learning mechanism","channel selection decision-making","frequency 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-U","Unlicensed bands","Channel Selection","Q-learning","Coexistence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning-based coexistence for LTE operation in unlicensed bands","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454679","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-based coexistence for LTE operation in unlicensed bands","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073062S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247527,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongho Jeon","affiliation":["Communication and Devices Group Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeongho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37712140700"},{"name":"Huaning Niu","affiliation":["Communication and Devices Group Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaning","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085380559"},{"name":"Qian Li","affiliation":["Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Apostolos Papathanassiou","affiliation":["Communication and Devices Group Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Papathanassiou","id":"37359752500"},{"name":"Geng Wu","affiliation":["Communication and Devices Group Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37855671600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247527","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Long Term Evolution","Load modeling","Loading","Detectors","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","spread spectrum communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE","listen-before-talk","unlicensed spectrum","Long Term Evolution","3rd Generation Partnership Project","3GPP","wireless local area network","WLAN","IEEE 802.11ax"]}],"abstract":"We consider the adoption of listen-before-talk (LBT) for Long Term Evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum, which is currently under discussion in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

In our study, we observe that a proper coexistence mechanism is imperative especially when both LTE Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) and WLANs are located outdoor. The outdoor deployment scenario is considered by the next generation WLAN, the IEEE 802.11ax, with high importance. The implementation of LBT in LTE plays an effective role in this scenario in balancing the performance between LTE and WLAN. In the conventional scenario where WLANs are located indoor and LTE eNBs are located outdoor, a plain coexistence without additional mechanism could be acceptable due to high penetration loss of outdoor walls.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE with listen-before-talk in unlicensed spectrum","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247527","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247527.pdf","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"LTE with listen-before-talk in unlicensed spectrum","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247527/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454592","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE with listen-before-talk in unlicensed spectrum","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049293S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247528,"authors":[{"name":"Yubing Jian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Yubing","lastName":"Jian","id":"37085660873"},{"name":"Chao-Fang Shih","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Chao-Fang","lastName":"Shih","id":"37085675424"},{"name":"Bhuvana Krishnaswamy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Bhuvana","lastName":"Krishnaswamy","id":"37085666943"},{"name":"Raghupathy Sivakumar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Raghupathy","lastName":"Sivakumar","id":"37272145500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247528","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1357},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Throughput","Interference","MIMO","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LAA-LTE","Wi-Fi","cellular technology","data access","mobile devices","mobile systems","license assisted access","channel sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LAA-LTE","LTE-A","Wi-Fi","coexistence","experimental performance evaluation"]}],"abstract":"LTE-A as a cellular technology has gained tremendous importance in recent years due to its high data-rates and improved data access for mobile devices. Recently, utilizing the unlicensed band as a supplementary band for LTE-A is being considered to expand the capacity of mobile systems. License-assisted access using LTE (LAA-LTE) will thus operate in the unlicensed band, and will operate in a spectrum that overlaps with Wi-Fi, another popular unlicensed-band technology. The concern is that LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi are unlikely to have mechanisms to directly coordinate with each other to address channel-sharing issues. In this paper, we study the interference impact of LAA-LTE on Wi-Fi under various network conditions using purely experimental analysis in indoor environments. The following three questions are specifically considered in this paper: (1) What are the implications of LAA-LTE usage on Wi-Fi? (2) How should LAA-LTE or Wi-Fi be configured for Wi-Fi to be less impacted? (3) How should the LAA-LTE MAC protocol be designed to be gracefully co-exist with Wi-Fi? To answer the above questions, we present comprehensive experimental results and give insights based on the results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247528","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247528.pdf","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LAA-LTE: Experimental evaluation, analysis and insights","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LAA-LTE: Experimental evaluation, analysis and insights","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454452","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LAA-LTE: Experimental evaluation, analysis and insights","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09092S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247531,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed K.

However, in order to achieve the benefits of aerodynamic efficiency, the inter-vehicle distances must be kept short. This implies that the intra-platoon communication must not only be reliable but also able to meet strict timing deadlines. In this paper, we propose a framework that reliably handles the co-existence of both time-triggered and event-driven control messages in platooning applications and we derive an efficient message dissemination technique. We propose a semi-centralized time division multiple access (TDMA) approach, which e.g., can be placed on top of the current standard IEEE 802.11p and we evaluate the resulting error probability and delay, when using it to broadcast periodic beacons and disseminating event-driven messages within a platoon. Simulation results indicate that the proposed dissemination policy significantly enhances the reliability for a given number of available time-slots, or alternatively, reduces the delay, in terms of time-slots, required to achieve a certain target error probability, without degrading the performance of co-existing time-triggered messages.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247547","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247547","startPage":"2471","endPage":"2476","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247547.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247547/","displayDocTitle":"A framework for reliable exchange of periodic and event-driven messages in platoons","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15440580","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247547/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for reliable exchange of periodic and event-driven messages in platoons","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050467S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247550,"authors":[{"name":"Romeu Monteiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal","\u2021Veniam Works, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Romeu","lastName":"Monteiro","id":"37085747424"},{"name":"Luis Guedes","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Guedes","id":"37085741133"},{"name":"Tiago Condeixa","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Condeixa","id":"37546215200"},{"name":"Filipe Neves","affiliation":["\u2021Veniam Works, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Filipe","lastName":"Neves","id":"37085630549"},{"name":"Susana Sargento","affiliation":["Camegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA","Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Susana","lastName":"Sargento","id":"37282378300"},{"name":"Lucas Guardalben","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Guardalben","id":"37869435900"},{"name":"Peter Steenkiste","affiliation":["Camegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Steenkiste","id":"37271596300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247550","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"Vehicular networks are inherently unstable networks with high mobility and intermittent connectivity.

During the operation a fleet of AUVs communicate among themselves and exchange two type of information. The first includes control signal which has a low-data rate but has a very stringent bit error rate (BER) requirement and the second being the data collected by the AUVs in the form of high resolution video, pictures and important sensor observations, which has a high-data rate but a little relaxed BER constraint. This paper proposes an efficient two-rate data transmission scheme for AUV communication using carrier interferometry (CI) coded direct sequence code-division multiple access (CI/DS-CDMA). The BER performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the conventional Walsh Hadamard (WH) coded DS-CDMA in underwater channel and is shown to ensure improved BER performance. For two-rate communication we assume a basic low-data rate (LDR) \u201cR\u201d and a high-data rate (HDR) as \u201c2R\u201d and we further presume that the acceptable BER of LDR is atleast an order of magnitude less than that of the HDR. Simulation results show that with CI/DS-CDMA scheme, the high-data rate communication achieves a BER of 3\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n at 20 dB whereas the low data rate communication reach a BER of 1.76\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n at 16 dB for a typical underwater channel. The results justify CI/DS-CDMA scheme as a deserving candidate for single rate as well as two-rate underwater acoustic communication.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247552.pdf","startPage":"2501","endPage":"2506","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CI/DS-CDMA scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Vehicles","Underwater acoustics","Conferences","OFDM","Interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","code division multiple access","error statistics","radiowave interferometers","spread spectrum communication","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-rate underwater acoustic communication","high-data rate communication","underwater channel","carrier interferometry coded direct sequence code-division multiple access","two-rate data transmission scheme","sensor observations","pictures","high resolution video","relaxed BER constraint","bit error rate requirement","low-data rate communication","control signal","information exchange","AUV communication","autonomous underwater vehicle communication","CI-DS-CDMA scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AUV communication","DS-CDMA","WH","CI","BER","two-rate communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"CI/DS-CDMA scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247552/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15472596","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CI/DS-CDMA scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570092053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069661S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247559,"authors":[{"name":"Chengchen Mao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Chengchen","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085707417"},{"name":"Miao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085453973"},{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406928600"},{"name":"Guodong Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37594998700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247559","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Resource management","Object detection","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","fading channels","MIMO communication","MIMO radar","power control","probability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-RSN","multiinput multioutput radar sensor networks","power allocation methods","MIMO system","channel gain","system throughput performance improvement","water-filling method","equal power method","channel inversion method","target detection probability","false alarm rate","flat fading channels","baker code","transmitting signal","power control schemes"]}],"abstract":"Investigation in MIMO-RSN (Multi-input Multi-output radar sensor networks) is becoming more attractive in current literature.

Furthermore, the users expect the utmost in quality with seamless connectivity to the broadband access. On this basis, moving networks emerge as a promising enhancement for fifth generation (5G) systems to enable flexible network deployment that goes beyond the scope of conventional fixed access nodes. Within the framework of moving networks, nomadic nodes (NNs) can enable demand-driven service provisioning to increase the network capacity or to extend the cell coverage area, and to reduce network energy consumption. NNs can be mounted on vehicles within a car-sharing fleet. In this paper, we look at the envisioned dynamic and flexible network deployment through NNs, and demonstrate analyses on the operation of nomadic networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards flexible network deployment in 5G: Nomadic node enhancement to heterogeneous networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247565","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247565.pdf","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards flexible network deployment in 5G: Nomadic node enhancement to heterogeneous networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247565/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454497","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards flexible network deployment in 5G: Nomadic node enhancement to heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570089447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058418S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247569,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Naghshin","affiliation":["School of Eng. and Information Tech., The University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Naghshin","id":"38469635100"},{"name":"Mark C.

Unlike traditional cellular networks where the associated base stations (BSs) in downlink and uplink are the same, in decoupled association the associated BSs in uplink and downlink can be different. The probability of user associations in co-channel BSs in finite multi-tier networks (with finite number of BSs) are derived for both uplink and downlink cases. In this paper, the wireless channel is modeled as large-scale fading and small-scale fading, and the transmit power, path loss exponent and bias factor for each BS are different. Based on probability of user associations derived for uplink and downlink, an efficient decoupled association scheme is proposed where the BS with highest probability of user association is selected as the serving BS.

Data collected from IoT is usually offloaded to the Cloud which may further leave data prone to a variety of attacks if security and privacy issues are not handled properly. Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations. This paper, for the first time, presents the challenges and opportunities in anomaly detection for IoT and cloud.

To achieve high secrecy sum rate, a secrecy sum rate maximization problem via cooperative beamforming with or without artificial noise is formulated under individual relay power constraint. The problem is shown to be non-convex. We then reformulate it into a difference of convex programming problem, relax it by a tight semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and approximate it into sequential convex problems by first-order Taylor expansion, which eventually leads to a high-rate beamforming solution. The simulations show that our developed beamforming scheme can achieve high secrecy sum rate and fast convergence.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247574","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247574.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247574","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-rate cooperative beamforming for physical-layer security in wireless cyber-physical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"High-rate cooperative beamforming for physical-layer security in wireless cyber-physical systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247574/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454466","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-rate cooperative beamforming for physical-layer security in wireless cyber-physical systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570088333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076804S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247582,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Qiu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085612924"},{"name":"Maode Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Maode","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280212000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247582","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Cryptography","Protocols","Servers","Internet of things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","Internet","Internet of Things","personal area networks","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authentication scheme","key establishment scheme","security enhancement","M2M communication","6LoWPAN","wireless communication technology","machine-to-machine communication","Internet of Things","IoT","Internet protocol version 6","IPv6","low power wireless personal area network","Internet engineering task force","IETF","protocol layer","protocol composition logic","PCL","simple Promela interpreter","SPIN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["6LoWPAN","Authentication","M2M","PCL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247582","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247582.pdf","startPage":"2671","endPage":"2676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An authentication and key establishment scheme to enhance security for M2M in 6LoWPANs","abstract":"With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies, machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, which is an essential part of the Internet of Things (IoT), allows wireless and wired systems to monitor environments without human intervention. To extend the use of M2M applications, the standard of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), developed by The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), would be applied into M2M communication to enable IP-based M2M sensing devices to connect to the open Internet. Although the 6LoWPAN standard has specified important issues in the communication, security functionalities at different protocol layers have not been detailed. In this paper, we propose an enhanced authentication and key establishment scheme for 6LoWPAN networks in M2M communications. The security proof by the Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) and the formal verification by the Simple Promela Interpreter (SPIN) show that the proposed scheme in 6LoWPAN could enhance the security functionality with the ability to prevent malicious attacks such as replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation attacks, Sybil attacks, and etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247582/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454630","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An authentication and key establishment scheme to enhance security for M2M in 6LoWPANs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An authentication and key establishment scheme to enhance security for M2M in 6LoWPANs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046516S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7247584,"authors":[{"name":"Jinkyu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinkyu","lastName":"Kang","id":"38194399500"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, NJIT, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Joonhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joonhyuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37288717500"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247584","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coherence","Optimization","Stochastic processes","Noise","Quantization (signal)","Baseband","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data compression","fading channels","minimisation","precoding","stochastic programming","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint precoding","fronthaul optimization","C-RAN","cloud radio access networks","ergodic fading channels","fronthaul compression","optimal functional split","radio units","central unit","RU","CU","stochastic successive upper-bound minimization approach","system parameters","fronthaul capacity","channel coherence time","instantaneous CSI","stochastic CSI","unprecedented wireless traffic growth","cellular systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247584","abstract":"This work investigates the joint design of fronthaul compression and precoding for the downlink of Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RANs).

Optimization algorithms over fronthaul compression and precoding are proposed that are based on a stochastic successive upper-bound minimization approach.

Under this model, we investigate the message-sharing transmission strategy where the CP shares each user's message with a fixed subset of BSs, which then serve the user through joint beamforming. In this setting, although the overall long-term average backhaul consumption is limited by the fixed cluster size, the instantaneous backhaul consumption at each BS may vary significantly depending on the data rates of the scheduled users at each time slot. To avoid such large fluctuations in backhaul consumption, this paper proposes a backhaul-aware multicell scheduling and beamforming strategy that explicitly accounts for backhaul consumption. Specifically, a beamforming design algorithm is proposed to maximize the network utility for a downlink C-RAN under both per-BS power constraints and per- BS backhaul constraints in each time slot. Although this problem has already been considered in our previous work, this present paper proposes a new beamforming design algorithm that not only has guaranteed convergence but also achieves better system performance. This paper also shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm can be further improved by iterating with an additional power minimization step.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backhaul-aware multicell beamforming for downlink cloud radio access network","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247585","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247585.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Backhaul-aware multicell beamforming for downlink cloud radio access network","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247585/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backhaul-aware multicell beamforming for downlink cloud radio access network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570090407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053118S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247586,"authors":[{"name":"Yanting Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yanting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085699745"},{"name":"Min Sheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37410574200"},{"name":"Xijun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38667163200"},{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487467"},{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Han","id":"37537329600"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"},{"name":"Yan Shi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37420083900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247586","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Uplink","Downlink","Mobile communication","Voltage control","Batteries","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","decision theory","energy consumption","smart phones","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-optimal partial computation offloading","dynamic voltage scaling","DVS technology","energy consumption","smart mobile device","SMD","nonconvex problem","offloading decision"]}],"abstract":"The incorporation of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technology into computation offloading could further reduce energy consumption of smart mobile device (SMD), which has not been fully studied.

These techniques hold equally for wireless and wireline communication channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247594","startPage":"2744","endPage":"2749","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247594.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foundations of Green communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Foundations of Green communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247594/","accessionNumber":"15454662","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247594/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foundations of Green communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570084941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053609S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7247599,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Mehbodniya","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Mehbodniya","id":"37419363800"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Temma","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Temma","id":"38000576200"},{"name":"Ren Sugai","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Sugai","id":"37085607645"},{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"Ismail Guvenc","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Guvenc","id":"37085348460"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247599","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247599","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Conferences","Resource management","Switches","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cochannel interference","game theory","resource allocation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access","wireless heterogeneous networks","small cell base stations","overlaid macro cell BS","radio resource allocation","hybrid interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment","BS sleep mode algorithm","co-channel interference","user equipments","game-theory based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel segregation","dynamic channel assignment","energy-efficiency","game theory","heterogeneous network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247599","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247599.pdf","startPage":"2775","endPage":"2780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access in wireless heterogeneous networks","abstract":"The heterogeneous network (HetNet) which consists of several small cell base stations (BSs) and an overlaid macro cell BS is a promising solution to accomplish very high data rate and energy-efficient communication. The design of energy-efficient mechanisms and radio resource allocation among BSs is an important issue in HetNet. There are a variety of ON/OFF switching algorithms for BSs in the literature. However, none of these algorithms jointly consider the resource allocation problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA) and BS sleep mode algorithm. This algorithm helps to mitigate the co-channel interference (CCI), experienced by user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show that by applying the proposed IACS-DCA approach along with a game-theory based algorithm for ON/OFF switching, higher energy- and spectral-efficiency can be achieved compared to the conventional approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247599/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15440607","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247599/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access in wireless heterogeneous networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access in wireless heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570086951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094297S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247606,"authors":[{"name":"Chrispin Gray","affiliation":["Centre for Energy-Efficient Telecommunications, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Chrispin","lastName":"Gray","id":"37085652496"},{"name":"Robert Ayre","affiliation":["Centre for Energy-Efficient Telecommunications, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ayre","id":"37319403100"},{"name":"Kerry Hinton","affiliation":["Centre for Energy-Efficient Telecommunications, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Kerry","lastName":"Hinton","id":"37319401500"},{"name":"Rodney S.

This paper examines, from an energy consumption viewpoint, some options for deploying a network of \u201cThings\u201d and connecting them through their gateway into the Internet or a corporate network. It focuses specifically on the access network from the customer premises to the central office and the implications for this network of carrying uplinkdominant IoT traffic. The power consumption of a number of potential access network technologies and architectures is modelled for a range of IoT traffic and background network traffic levels. It is shown that shared corporate Wi-Fi network with PON backhaul can be the most energy efficient option if the Wi-Fi background traffic level is modest. Otherwise, a 4G Wireless (LTE) access is also very efficient if the site IoT traffic level is low - up to around 100 kb/s. At higher rates a GPON access provides the most energy efficient solution.","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247606","startPage":"2818","endPage":"2823","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247606.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power consumption of IoT access network technologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Logic gates","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Modems","Passive optical networks","Downlink","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","Internet of Things","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","IoT access network technologies","Internet of Things","energy consumption","network of things","corporate network","central office","IoT traffic","background network traffic levels","corporate Wi-Fi network","PON backhaul","Wi-Fi background traffic level","4G wireless","LTE access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power consumption","internet of things","access network technologies","power efficient","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power consumption of IoT access network technologies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247606/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15454451","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power consumption of IoT access network technologies","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570085723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054372S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":7247608,"authors":[{"name":"Bhanukiran Perabathini","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Bell Labs, Nozay, France","Department of Telecommunications, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Bhanukiran","lastName":"Perabathini","id":"37085408377"},{"name":"Ejder Ba\u015ftu\u011f","affiliation":["Large Networks and Systems Group (LANEAS), Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Ejder","lastName":"Ba\u015ftu\u011f","id":"38570102500"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Kountouris","id":"37294325000"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Large Networks and Systems Group (LANEAS), Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Alberto Conte","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Bell Labs, Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Conte","id":"38558564700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247608","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":891},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Mobile communication","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Measurement","Power demand","IEEE catalogs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive capabilities","context-awareness","5G wireless networks","energy efficiency","area power consumption","APC","EE","base stations","mobile users","homogeneous Poisson point processes","PPP","coverage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","mobile wireless networks","caching","energy efficiency","area power consumption","stochastic geometry"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247608","abstract":"Endowed with context-awareness and proactive capabilities, caching users' content locally at the edge of the network is able to cope with increasing data traffic demand in 5G wireless networks. In this work, we focus on the energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless cellular networks, specifically in terms of area power consumption (APC) and energy efficiency (EE). We assume that both base stations (BSs) and mobile users are distributed according to homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) and we introduce a detailed power model that takes into account caching. We study the conditions under which the area power consumption is minimized with respect to BS transmit power, while ensuring a certain quality of service (QoS) in terms of coverage probability. Furthermore, we provide the optimal BS transmit power that maximizes the area spectral efficiency per unit total power spent. The main takeaway of this paper is that caching seems to be an energy efficient solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247062","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226899/7247062/07247608.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247608","startPage":"2830","endPage":"2835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching at the edge: A green perspective for 5G networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247608/","displayDocTitle":"Caching at the edge: A green perspective for 5G networks","htmlLink":"/document/7247608/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454417","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching at the edge: A green perspective for 5G networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570087761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053299S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7226899","isNumber":"7247062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7226899","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7247062","articleId":"7247608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247613,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen Univ., Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085568255"},{"name":"Haohao Qin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haohao","lastName":"Qin","id":"37712811700"},{"name":"Limin Xiao","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085639669"},{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085645100"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085486593"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6305-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7038"}],"articleNumber":"7247613","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Cryptography","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","iterative methods","minimisation","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication power management","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","iterative algorithm","target secrecy rate","subcarrier allocation","nonconvex transmit power minimization problem","power consumption","time domain artificial noise","multiple legitimate receiver","legitimate transmitter","power efficiency improvement","multiuser wiretap orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","multiuser wiretap OFDM channel","power-efficient joint resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the resource allocation for multiuser wiretap Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing(OFDM) systems is investigated to improve the system power efficiency.

The time-domain artificial noise (AN) is firstly involved to guarantee the target secrecy rates of multiple Bobs. Different from the traditional sum secrecy rate maximization problem which may result in the unfair transition for Bobs with bad channel gains and more transmit power consumptions, a non-convex transmit power minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the power, subcarrier allocation and AN design, in which a target secrecy rate for each individual Bob is ensured. An iterative algorithm is further proposed to solve this power minimization problem by updating the subcarrier, power allocation and AN design alternatively.

This paper proposed a system that helps users automatically find a free parking space at the least cost based on new performance metrics to calculate the user parking cost by considering the distance and the total number of free places in each car park. This cost will be used to offer a solution of finding an available parking space upon a request by the user and a solution of suggesting a new car park if the current car park is full. The simulation results show that the algorithm helps improve the probability of successful parking and minimizes the user waiting time. We also successfully implemented the proposed system in the real world.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cloud-Based Smart-Parking System Based on Internet-of-Things Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2477299","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2477299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07247632.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247632","topic":"Emerging Cloud-Based Wireless Communications and Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"A Cloud-Based Smart-Parking System Based on Internet-of-Things Technologies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7247632/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15462545","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Cloud-Based Smart-Parking System Based on Internet-of-Things Technologies","sourcePdf":"access-deng-2477299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07937S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Emerging Cloud-Based Wireless Communications and Networks"],"articleId":"7247632","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247633,"authors":[{"name":"Alphan \u015eahin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alphan \u015eahin received the B.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering and telecommunication engineering, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Istanbul Technical\n University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2005, 2006, and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering\n from the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA, in 2013.

We show that AOA-based localization method allows the receiver to locate itself via a least squares estimator by exploiting the directionality of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We then prove that when the RSS information is taken into account, the positioning accuracy of AOA-based localization can be improved further using a weighted least squares solution. On the other hand, when the radiation patterns of LEDs are explicitly considered in the estimation, RSS-based localization yields highly accurate results. In order to deal with the system of non-linear equations for RSS-based localization, we develop an analytical learning rule based on the Newton-Raphson method. The non-convex structure is addressed by initializing the learning rule based on 1) location estimates, and 2) a newly developed method, which we refer as a random report and cluster algorithm. As a benchmark, we also derive the analytical expression of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound for RSS-based localization, which captures any deployment scenario positioning in 3-D geometry. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions for a wide range of LED characteristics and orientations through extensive computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid 3-D Localization for Visible Light Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2477502","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7286894/07247633.pdf","startPage":"4589","endPage":"4599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2477502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247633","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/50/7286894/7247633-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid 3-D Localization for Visible Light Communication Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/7247633/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15500103","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1422062 and CNS-1422354"},{"fundingName":"2014 Ralph E.

However, quantization introduces errors, which results in performance penalties. By analyzing the occurrence probability of the perturbation coefficients, an MMSE-based optimization of perturbation coefficients quantization is proposed and demonstrated in ultra-large-area-fiber transmission systems with a 36Gbd DP-16QAM modulation format. Compared to conventional uniform quantization schemes, a significant reduction in quantization errors has been realized for both the real and imaginary parts of the perturbation coefficients. Compared with the nonquantization case, computational term reduction by a factor of 50 is achieved in 2400 km ULAF transmission with <; 0.2 dB Q degradation. For the same Q improvement, optimized quantization scheme further reduce the computational term by 50% compared to that of the uniform quantization method. We also analyze the tolerance to link dispersion.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2470557","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"4311","endPage":"4317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2470557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258411","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7258411/07247639.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Optical fiber dispersion","Gain","Optimization","Optical fiber polarization","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","nonlinear optics","optical fibre communication","optical links","optical modulation","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE-based optimization","perturbation coefficient quantization","perturbation-based digital fiber nonlinearity mitigation methods","ultralarge-area-fiber transmission systems","DP-16QAM modulation format","quantization errors","link dispersion","tolerance analysis","occurrence probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive signal processing","digital coherent detection","optical fiber communication","phase modulation"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive signal processing","digital coherent detection","optical fiber communication","phase modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-Based Optimization of Perturbation Coefficients Quantization for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247639/","volume":"33","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/7247639/","accessionNumber":"15452598","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","publicationDate":"15 Oct.15, 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15, 15 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-Based Optimization of Perturbation Coefficients Quantization for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation","sourcePdf":"jlt-li-2470557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094673S","chronDate":"Oct.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7258411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7258411","articleId":"7247639","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7247641,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Mu Tsai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Precision Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Cheng-Mu Tsai was born in Tainan, Taiwan, RO.C., in 1974.

A modern projector lens still exposes its rays on a large flat screen to form the image, with the result that the FCA is one of the key aberrations dominating the image quality. Most commercial optical software applies the DLS optimization focus on the minimum spot size to optimize the lens, simultaneously making the FCA hard to improve. Merging the GA optimization can involve the FCA in the optimization process. As a result, using the hybrid GA with DLS optimization not only effectively suppresses the FCA but also remarkably enhances the image resolution in a projector lens design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15645685","volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7247641/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Filed Curvature Aberration in a Projector Lens by Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm With Damped Least Square Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Filed Curvature Aberration in a Projector Lens by Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm With Damped Least Square Optimization","sourcePdf":"jdt-tsai-2474740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07918S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"7317626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7317626","articleId":"7247641","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247644,"authors":[{"name":"Changzhou Hua","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changzhou","lastName":"Hua","id":"37085634312"},{"name":"Zhongxiang Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhongxiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37273304700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7247644","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1301},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Electron tubes","Antenna feeds","Impedance","Sea measurements","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopole antennas","seawater"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic-type shunt excited sea-water monopole antenna","shunt-excited feeding structure","ANSYS HFSS software","conducting tube","Gamma-shape feeding arm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic-type","high-efficiency","sea-water monopole","shunt-excited","water antennas"]},{"kwd":["Dynamic-type","high-efficiency","sea-water monopole","shunt-excited","water antennas"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic-type sea-water monopole antenna of high efficiency is presented by using a new shunt-excited feeding structure.

An equivalent circuit model and ANSYS HFSS software are used in the analysis and design of the sea-water monopole antenna. In order to verify the validity of our design concept, two prototypes of shunt-excited sea-water monopole antennas are designed and fabricated: static-type and dynamic-type.

In contrast to previous works, the design goal is to have a multibeam antenna with arbitrary low sidelobes and at the same time a high crossing level between adjacent radiated beams. These two constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously for any passive and lossless multibeam antenna systems with a single radiating aperture due to beam orthogonality. Here, this limitation is overcome using the \u201csplit aperture decoupling\u201d method which consists in using two radiating apertures. Each aperture is associated with a pillbox quasi-optical system with several integrated feed horns in its focal plane so as to steer the main beam in the azimuthal plane. The antenna operates at 24.15 GHz and presents very good scanning performance over an angular sector of \u00b140\u00b0, with a good agreement between full-wave simulations and measurements. The crossover level between adjacent beams is about -3 dB with a sidelobe level lower than -24 dB for the central beam and better than -11 dB for the extreme beam positions. The isolation between feed horns in the same pillbox system is better than 20 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7312523/07247660.pdf","startPage":"5209","endPage":"5215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2477520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2477520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multibeam Pillbox Antenna With Low Sidelobe Level and High-Beam Crossover in SIW Technology Using the Split Aperture Decoupling Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feeds","Couplings","Aperture antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","multibeam antennas","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam pillbox antenna","low sidelobe level","high beam crossover","SIW technology","split aperture decoupling method","slotted waveguide radiation","substrate integrated waveguide","multibeam antenna","adjacent radiated beams","multibeam antenna systems","pillbox quasioptical system","azimuthal plane","angular sector","full-wave simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-beam antenna","pillbox architecture","substrate integrated waveguide","slotted waveguides"]},{"kwd":["Multibeam antenna","pillbox architecture","slotted waveguides","substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multibeam Pillbox Antenna With Low Sidelobe Level and High-Beam Crossover in SIW Technology Using the Split Aperture Decoupling Method","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7247660/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568414","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibeam Pillbox Antenna With Low Sidelobe Level and High-Beam Crossover in SIW Technology Using the Split Aperture Decoupling Method","sourcePdf":"tap-tekkouk-2477520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054203S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7312523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7312523","articleId":"7247660","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247664,"authors":[{"name":"Gaofei Huang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gaofei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37671314500"},{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468802400"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37272689000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7247664","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1059},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Employing energy harvesting (EH) at the relay with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is promising to prolong lifetime of energy-constrained relay networks.

In this paper, a novel hybrid-type superconducting DCCB model (SDCCB) is proposed. The SDCCB has a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) located in the main line, to limit the fault current until the final trip signal to the SDCCB is given. After the trip signal, insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) switches located in the main line will commutate the fault current into a parallel line, where dc current is forced to zero by combination of IGBTs and surge arresters. DC fault current behavior in MTDC and fundamental requirements of DCCB for MTDC were described, followed by an explanation of the working principles of the SDCCB. To prove the viability of the SDCCB, a simulation analysis demonstrating SDCCB current interruption performance was done for changing the intensity of dc fault current. It was observed that the passive current limiting by SFCL caused significant reduction in fault current interruption stress for SDCCB. Furthermore, fundamental design requirements for SFCL, including the effect of SFCL quenching impedance on SFCL voltage rating and energy dissipation capacity, were investigated. Finally, advantages and limitations of the SDCCB were highlighted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247671/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15500361","htmlLink":"/document/7247671/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","externalId":"5603009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Model of HVDC Hybrid-Type Superconducting Circuit Breaker and Its Performance Analysis for Limiting and Breaking DC Fault Currents","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Human Resources Program in Energy Technology"},{"fundingName":"Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea","grantNumber":"20154030200730"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Model of HVDC Hybrid-Type Superconducting Circuit Breaker and Its Performance Analysis for Limiting and Breaking DC Fault Currents","sourcePdf":"tasc-lee-2477373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057227S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"7283731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7283731","articleId":"7247671","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247673,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zhuang","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7352393/7247673/zhuan-2477444-small.gif","p":["Yuan Zhuang received the bachelor\u2019s degree in information engineering and the master\u2019s degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in geomatics engineering from the University of Calgary, Canada, in 2015.","He has been a Lead Scientist with Bluvision Inc., Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, since 2015.

However, indoor navigation still faces many challenges and practical issues, such as the need for special hardware designs and complicated infrastructure requirements. This paper originally proposes a pedestrian navigator based on tightly coupled (TC) integration of low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and WiFi for handheld devices. Two other approaches are proposed in this paper to enhance the navigation performance: the use of MEMS solution based on pedestrian dead reckoning/inertial navigation system (PDR/INS) integration and the use of motion constraints, such as non-holonomic constraints, zero velocity update, and zero angular rate update for the MEMS solution. There are two main contributions in this paper: TC fusion of WiFi, INS, and PDR for pedestrian navigation using an extended Kalman filter and better heading estimation using PDR and INS integration to remove the gyro noise that occurs when only vertical gyroscope is used. The performance of the proposed navigation algorithms has been extensively verified through field tests in indoor environments. The experiment results showed that the average root mean square position error of the proposed TC integration solution was 3.47 m in three trajectories, which is 0.01% of INS, 10.38% of PDR, 32.11% of the developed MEMS solution, and 64.58% of the loosely coupled integration. The proposed TC integrated navigation system can work well in the environment with sparse deployment of WiFi access points.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Micromechanical devices","Navigation","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Sensors","Estimation","Three-dimensional displays","Gyroscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","gyroscopes","indoor navigation","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","mean square error methods","microsensors","nonlinear filters","pedestrians","sensor fusion","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi access point","average root mean square position error","gyroscope noise removal","extended Kalman filter","zero velocity update","zero angular rate update","PDR-INS","pedestrian dead reckoning-inertial navigation system","microelectromechanical system","TC integration","tightly-coupled integration","indoor pedestrian navigation","handheld device","MEMS sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tightly-coupled integration","indoor pedestrian navigation","MEMS sensors","WiFi","motion constraints"]},{"kwd":["Tightly-coupled integration","indoor pedestrian navigation","MEMS sensors","WiFi","motion constraints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247673","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2477444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07247673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2477444","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tightly-Coupled Integration of WiFi and MEMS Sensors on Handheld Devices for Indoor Pedestrian Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tightly-Coupled Integration of WiFi and MEMS Sensors on Handheld Devices for Indoor Pedestrian Navigation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247673/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7247673/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15677553","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tightly-Coupled Integration of WiFi and MEMS Sensors on Handheld Devices for Indoor Pedestrian Navigation","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhuang-2477444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083162S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7352393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7352393","articleId":"7247673","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247674,"authors":[{"name":"Paul M.

On the other hand, the actual motor operation depends on the driving cycle of the vehicle, which might be different than the rated conditions. This paper deals with the design and optimization of a permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motor according to two different duty cycles, one for city driving and another for mixed driving operation. A procedure is proposed to evaluate the most effective design areas by means of a series of representative points, which have been considered for the global optimization.

The proposed SMC is simpler than the existing SMC methods devised for grid-connected VSIs since its sliding-surface function requires the sensing of capacitor voltage and grid current only. In addition, a double-band hysteresis scheme which ensures the switching of a transistor in the VSI during a half cycle while it remains either on or off in the other half cycle of the fundamental period is used to mitigate the switching frequency. Furthermore, the analytical expressions for the instantaneous and average switching frequencies are derived. The theoretical considerations and analytical results are verified through computer simulations and experimental results obtained from a 3.3-kW system. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed SMC strategy exhibits an excellent performance in achieving the required control objectives such as fast dynamic response, robustness, sinusoidal grid current with low total harmonic distortion, and simplicity in a practical implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Switching frequency","Power harmonic filters","Switches","Damping","Inverters","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hysteresis","invertors","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding-mode control","single-phase grid-connected LCL-filtered VSI","double-band hysteresis scheme","voltage source inverters","capacitor voltage","grid current","switching frequency","power 3.3 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid-connected inverter","single-phase voltage source inverter","sliding mode control","double-band hysteresis scheme"]},{"kwd":["Double-band hysteresis scheme","grid-connected inverter","single-phase voltage-source inverter (VSI)","sliding-mode control (SMC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07247693.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding-Mode Control for Single-Phase Grid-Connected --Filtered VSI With Double-Band Hysteresis Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sliding-Mode Control for Single-Phase Grid-Connected <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mbox{LCL}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Filtered VSI With Double-Band Hysteresis Scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247693/","volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247693/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697147","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding-Mode Control for Single-Phase Grid-Connected <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mbox{LCL}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Filtered VSI With Double-Band Hysteresis Scheme","sourcePdf":"tie-komurcugil-2477486-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136728S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7247693","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":7247697,"authors":[{"name":"Umesh Chand","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7302109/7247697/chand-2471835-small.gif","p":["Umesh Chand received the M.S. degree in solid-state electronics from IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India, in 2010.

The proposed approach leverages stochastic geometry for system-level analysis, by modeling the locations of base stations, relay nodes and mobile terminals as points of homogeneous Poisson point processes. A flexible cell association and relay-aided transmission protocol based on the best biased average received power are considered. Computationally tractable integrals and closed-form expressions for coverage and rate are provided, and the performance trends of relay-aided cellular networks are identified. It is shown that coverage and rate highly depend on the path-loss exponents of one- and two-hop links. In the interference-limited regime, in particular, it is shown that, if the system is not adequately designed, the presence of relay nodes may provide negligible performance gains. By capitalizing on the proposed mathematical framework, a system-level and interference-aware optimization criterion of the bias coefficients is proposed. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system-level optimization to enhance the coverage probability in the interference-limited regime. The presence of relays, on the other hand, is shown to have a limited impact on average/coverage rate under the same assumptions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07247703.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2477498","startPage":"4063","endPage":"4085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Geometry Modeling and System-Level Analysis & Optimization of Relay-Aided Downlink Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247703/","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Geometry Modeling and System-Level Analysis & Optimization of Relay-Aided Downlink Cellular Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247703/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15676761","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"FP7-PEOPLE MITN-CROSSFIRE Project","grantNumber":"317126"},{"fundingName":"H2020-PEOPLE ETN-5Gwireless Project","grantNumber":"641985"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Geometry Modeling and System-Level Analysis & Optimization of Relay-Aided Downlink Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-direnzo-2477498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217763S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7247703","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247709,"authors":[{"name":"Jiadai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7247709/liu-2477487-small.gif","p":["Jiadai Liu (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008 and the M.Eng. degree from the University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, in 2010.

This model is inspired by the mesh generated in finite-element method (FEM) tools to depict the major flux paths in the transformer. All of the major nonlinear phenomena such as saturation, hysteresis, and eddy currents are captured in the transformer hardware emulation whose modules were developed in a 32-b floating point precision VHDL. The developed HR-MEC model and nonlinear numerical solution have been fully parallelized in hardware to achieve the lowest latency in the real-time implementation. The hysteresis in the transformer core is modeled using Preisach theory, and eddy currents are incorporated using a frequency-dependent network. The real-time results are validated using 3-D FEM analysis in JMAG software.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Power transformers","Computational modeling","Windings","Mathematical model","Sparse matrices","Magnetic hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy currents","EMTP","equivalent circuits","field programmable gate arrays","finite element analysis","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time nonlinear power transformer model","FPGA","power transformer electromagnetic transient model","real-time nonlinear high-resolution magnetic equivalent circuit","field-programmable gate array","hardware-in-the-loop simulation","finite-element method","transformer hardware emulation","Preisach theory","eddy currents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic transient analyses","Embedded systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Hysteresis","Magnetic equivalent circuit","Parallel algorithm","Parallel process","Pipelining","Real-time systems","Saturation","Transformer modeling"]},{"kwd":["Electromagnetic transient (EMT) analyses","embedded systems","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","hysteresis","magnetic equivalent circuit","parallel algorithm","parallel process","pipelining","real-time systems","saturation","transformer modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247709","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477487","startPage":"1191","endPage":"1202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07247709.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247709/","displayDocTitle":"Detailed Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Based Real-Time Nonlinear Power Transformer Model on FPGA for Electromagnetic Transient Studies","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","volume":"63","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697153","htmlLink":"/document/7247709/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Based Real-Time Nonlinear Power Transformer Model on FPGA for Electromagnetic Transient Studies","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2477487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7247709","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7247710,"authors":[{"name":"Quande Qin","affiliation":["College of Management, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7567607/7247710/qin-2474153-small.gif","p":["Quande Qin received the Ph.D. degree in management science and engineering from the School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2011.","He is currently a Lecturer with the College of Management, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

Population diversity maintenance is crucial for preventing particles from being stuck into local optima. In this paper, we present an improved PSO algorithm with an interswarm interactive learning strategy (IILPSO) by overcoming the drawbacks of the canonical PSO algorithm's learning strategy. IILPSO is inspired by the phenomenon in human society that the interactive learning behavior takes place among different groups. Particles in IILPSO are divided into two swarms. The interswarm interactive learning (IIL) behavior is triggered when the best particle's fitness value of both the swarms does not improve for a certain number of iterations. According to the best particle's fitness value of each swarm, the softmax method and roulette method are used to determine the roles of the two swarms as the learning swarm and the learned swarm. In addition, the velocity mutation operator and global best vibration strategy are used to improve the algorithm's global search capability. The IIL strategy is applied to PSO with global star and local ring structures, which are termed as IILPSO-G and IILPSO-L algorithm, respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithms with eight popular PSO variants. From the experimental results, IILPSO demonstrates the good performance in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, and reliability. Finally, the variations of the population diversity in the entire search process provide an explanation why IILPSO performs effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247710/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16302757","pubMedId":"26357418","htmlLink":"/document/7247710/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization With Interswarm Interactive Learning Strategy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71402103, 60975080 and 61273367"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"836"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China","grantNumber":"2012WYM_0116"},{"fundingName":"MOE Youth Foundation Project of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities in China","grantNumber":"13YJC630123"},{"fundingName":"PAPD and CICAEET project"},{"fundingName":"Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau under Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2012B10055"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization With Interswarm Interactive Learning Strategy","sourcePdf":"tcyb-cheng-2474153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160591S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7567607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7567607","articleId":"7247710","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247713,"authors":[{"name":"Neale A.

Since the MMC is structured based upon stacking up a number of series-connected identical submodules (SMs), to improve its fault tolerance and reliability, SM failure detection and location is of significant importance. In this paper, the impact of open-circuit switch failures of the SMs on the operation of the MMC is analyzed. Based on the analysis under SM failure conditions, two SM failure detection and location methods are proposed, that is, a clustering algorithm (CA)-based method and a calculated capacitance (CC)-based method. In the proposed CA-based method, a pattern-recognition-based fault diagnosis approach, which employs the clustering algorithm to detect and locate the faulty SMs with open-switch failures through identifying the pattern of 2-D trajectories of the SM characteristic variables, is developed. The proposed CC-based method is based on the calculation and comparison of a physical component parameter, that is, the nominal SM capacitance, and is capable of failure detection, location, and classification within one stage. The performance of the proposed failure detection methods for an MMC system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate the capabilities of the two proposed methods in detecting and locating any SM failure under various conditions accurately and efficiently.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Circuit faults","Switches","Clustering algorithms","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Trajectory","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel converter","open switch submodule failures","open-circuit switch failures","SM failure detection","SM failure location","clustering algorithm","pattern recognition","fault diagnosis","2D trajectories","SM characteristic variables","nominal SM capacitance","failure classification","time-domain simulation","PSCAD-EMTDC software environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calculated capacitance","clustering algorithm","failure detection and location","modular multilevel converter (MMC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2477476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7389461/07247725.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2477476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Detection, and Location of Open-Switch Submodule Failures in a Modular Multilevel Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Detection, and Location of Open-Switch Submodule Failures in a Modular Multilevel Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247725/","volume":"31","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247725/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15722269","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Detection, and Location of Open-Switch Submodule Failures in a Modular Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-yang-2477476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085696S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7389461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7389461","articleId":"7247725","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":7247727,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Yuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7247727/lin-small.gif","p":["Jing-Yuan Lin (M\u201913) was born in Kao-Hsiung, Taiwan, in 1978.\n He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and\n Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","In 2013, he was with the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taitung Junior College,\n Taitung, Taiwan.

Since only two active switches are needed, the cost and the circuit complexity can be lowered. To reduce switching loss, the proposed converter fulfills zero-voltage switching by employing the leakage inductance of the transformer and additional resonant inductance. By paralleling the transformer secondaries and changing the circuit architecture of each secondary side, we can make the output load current evenly shared among four output inductors such that the current stress and conduction losses of the output rectifiers can be decreased significantly. Moreover, the nonlinear step-down conversion ratio leads to a high duty utilization ratio for the proposed converter. Therefore, the DT-ACFC with NCR is suitable for applications of high output current and a wide input voltage range. Experimental results are shown to verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed forward converter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Video recording","Zero voltage switching","Switches","Stress","Capacitors","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductance","switching convertors","transformers","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-transformer active-clamp forward converter","DT-ACFC","NCR","circuit complexity","switching loss reduction","zero-voltage switching","transformer leakage inductance","resonant inductance","conduction losses","nonlinear step-down conversion ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward converter","active-clamp","zero-voltage-switching","non-linear conversion ratio"]},{"kwd":["Active-clamp","forward converter","nonlinear conversion ratio","zero-voltageswitching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07247727.pdf","startPage":"4353","endPage":"4361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Transformer Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Nonlinear Conversion Ratio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Transformer Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Nonlinear Conversion Ratio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247727/","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247727/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697298","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-027-131, 104-2221-E-027-129, 104-2221-E-011-057 and 104-3113-E-007-005-CC2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Transformer Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Nonlinear Conversion Ratio","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2477359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069928S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7247727","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7247745,"authors":[{"name":"Arnold W. de Jonge","affiliation":["Department of BioMechanical Engineering, Faculty 3me, Delft University of Technology, Mekelweg 2, 2628 CD Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4543165/7397002/7247745/jonge-small.gif","p":["Arnold W. de Jonge received the BSc and MSc degrees in mechanical\n engineering in 2009 and 2012 from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.

However, shared control designs may suffer from conflicts between individual human operators and constant haptic assistance when their desired trajectories differ, leading to momentarily increased forces, discomfort, or even deteriorated performance. This study investigates ways to reduce conflicts between individual human operators and a haptic shared controller by modifying supported trajectories. Subjects (n=12) performed a repetitive movement task in an abstract environment with varying spatio-temporal constraints, both during manual control and while supported by haptic shared control. Four types of haptic shared control were compared, combining two design properties: the initial supported trajectory (either the centerline of the environment or an individualized trajectory based on manual control trials), and trial-by-trial adaptation of guidance towards previously performed trajectories (either present or absent). Trial-by-trial adaptation of guidance reduced conflicts compared to non-adaptive guidance, whether the initial trajectory was individualized or not. Without trial-by-trial adaptation, individualized trajectories also reduced conflicts, but not completely: when guided, operators adapt their preferred trajectories. In conclusion, trial-by-trial adaptation is the most promising approach to mitigate conflicts during repetitive motion tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TOH.2015.2477302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","pdfPath":"/iel7/4543165/7397002/07247745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2015.2477302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7397002","startPage":"111","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Trial-by-Trial Adaptation on Conflicts in Haptic Shared Control for Free-Air Teleoperation Tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Trial-by-Trial Adaptation on Conflicts in Haptic Shared Control for Free-Air Teleoperation Tasks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2016","accessionNumber":"15871417","pubMedId":"26357407","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7247745/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Trial-by-Trial Adaptation on Conflicts in Haptic Shared Control for Free-Air Teleoperation Tasks","sourcePdf":"toh-dejonge-2477302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205865S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"4543165","isNumber":"7397002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4543165","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7397002","articleId":"7247745","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247748,"authors":[{"name":"Quan-Yong Fan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7360252/7247748/fan-2472974-small.gif","p":["Quan-Yong Fan received the B.S. degree from Henan University, Henan, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Information Science and Engineering.","His current research interests include fault-tolerant control, neural adaptive control, approximate dynamic programming, and optimal control."]},"firstName":"Quan-Yong","lastName":"Fan","id":"38571056400"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7360252/7247748/yang-2472974-small.gif","p":["Guang-Hong Yang (SM\u201904) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1983, 1986, and 1994, respectively.","He was a Lecturer/Associate Professor with Northeastern University from 1986 to 1995.

The main objective is to design a sliding-mode control methodology based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method, so that the closed-loop system with time-varying disturbances is stable and the nearly optimal performance of the sliding-mode dynamics can be guaranteed. In the first step, a neural network (NN)-based observer and a disturbance observer are designed to approximate the unknown nonlinear terms and estimate the input disturbances, respectively. Based on the NN approximations and disturbance estimations, the discontinuous part of the sliding-mode control is constructed to eliminate the effect of the disturbances and attain the expected equivalent sliding-mode dynamics. Then, the ADP method with AC structure is presented to learn the optimal control for the sliding-mode dynamics online. Reconstructed tuning laws are developed to guarantee the stability of the sliding-mode dynamics and the convergence of the weights of critic and actor NNs. Finally, the simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7360252/07247748.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Actor\u2013Critic Design-Based Integral Sliding-Mode Control for Partially Unknown Nonlinear Systems With Input Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Actor\u2013Critic Design-Based Integral Sliding-Mode Control for Partially Unknown Nonlinear Systems With Input Disturbances","volume":"27","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15678237","pubMedId":"26357411","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247748/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247748/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273148, 61273155 and 61420106016"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201157"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund through the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries","grantNumber":"2013ZCX01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Actor\u2013Critic Design-Based Integral Sliding-Mode Control for Partially Unknown Nonlinear Systems With Input Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yang-2472974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082841S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7360252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"7360252","articleId":"7247748","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7247749,"authors":[{"name":"Xueliang Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xueliang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085692453"},{"name":"Benjamin J.

At high densities (e.g., between 1 and 3 magnetic grains per coded bit), occasionally, a bit will not be written on any grain, and hence will effectively be overwritten (or erased) by bits on surrounding grains. DGSE enables the detection of overwritten bits so that their log-likelihood ratios are assigned small magnitudes, effectively making them erasures, which are easily filled in by linear channel codes. Past papers employing Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv-based detectors on a simple four-rectangular-grain model have shown that the DGSE is surprisingly resilient to mismatch between the detector's assumed grain model and the actual model generating the data. This paper presents a novel DGSE-TDMR detector based on the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm. The new detector employs a random discretized-nuclei Voronoi grain model. Simulation results show that the GBP-based TDMR turbo-detector accurately detects the overwritten bits and that it achieves low decoded bit error rates at densities as high as 0.4966 user bits per grain.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2477306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7384813/07247749.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2477306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384813","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Grain State Estimation for High-Density TDMR: Progress and Future Directions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Grain State Estimation for High-Density TDMR: Progress and Future Directions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isJournal":true,"externalId":"9400107","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720302","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7247749/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF-1218885"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Grain State Estimation for High-Density TDMR: Progress and Future Directions","sourcePdf":"tmag-sivakumar-2477306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06326S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7384813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7384813","articleId":"7247749","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247750,"authors":[{"name":"Bingcheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7247750/bizhu-2477398-small.gif","p":["Bingcheng Zhu received the B.A.Sc. degree in information engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2010.

In this paper, we derive asymptotically tight and closed-form upper and lower bounds for the error rates and the outage probabilities of maximum-ratio combining, equal-gain combining, and selection combining over arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The correlation between the Nakagami-m random variables is defined through the correlation matrix of the accompanying Gaussian random variables, which can uniquely determine the joint probability density function of the Nakagami-m variables. Using the analytical results and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the performance of diversity reception systems over Nakagami-m fading channels cannot be uniquely determined by the power correlation matrix of the branches.

The effects on small-cell uplink capacity by ICI and IBI and their mitigation have not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, the ICI and IBI of OFDMA two-tier networks with fractional power control (FPC) in multipath fading channels are formulated, and closed-form expressions of their covariance matrices at the SBS with random MU locations are derived. Simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis. It is shown that small-cell uplink capacity is substantially degraded in the presence of ICI and IBI. A precoding method for small cells for mitigating the effects of ICI and IBI on uplink capacity is proposed. In the method, the received signals over small-cell subcarriers at the SBS are decorrelated jointly by small-cell user (SU) precoders and an equalizer at the SBS. Closed-form design procedures for precoding of different subcarrier sizes to maximize uplink capacity under different information feedback are developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method for using all the subcarriers for precoding has a large capacity gain over that of no small-cell precoding. Moreover, the method can perform very well, even if MU locations are the only information fed back from the macrocell.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

radial basis function (RBF) neural network control algorithm can effectively improve the robotic manipulators' performance against a large amount of uncertainty. The adaptive law can be derived by using the Lyapunov method so that the stability of robotic manipulator control system and the weight self-adaptive convergence of RBF neural networks will be guaranteed. Meanwhile, system fluctuations and even overshot phenomenon under every start-up process, which are caused by the system's convergence from the given nonoptimal initial weight value to the optimal weight value, can be avoided by using memristors to remember the optimal weight after the system's first operation. According to the above analysis, this correspondence paper designs a kind of RBF neural network control algorithm based on spintronic memristors, and then analyzes its theoretical derivation process and core design idea. Finally, the system simulation model, which uses a two-link robotic manipulator as control object, is built to prove the algorithm's validity and feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can satisfy the effect of presupposition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7434135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7434135/07247753.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2453138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2015.2453138","startPage":"582","endPage":"588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spintronic Memristor-Based Neural Network With Radial Basis Function for Robotic Manipulator Control Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247753/","displayDocTitle":"A Spintronic Memristor-Based Neural Network With Radial Basis Function for Robotic Manipulator Control Implementation","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7247753/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15855457","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"2013-47"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372139, 61101233 and 60972155"},{"fundingName":"Spring Sunshine Plan Research Project of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"z2011148"},{"fundingName":"Technology Foundation for Selected Overseas Chinese Scholars"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Personnel in China","grantNumber":"2012-186"},{"fundingName":"University Excellent Talents Supporting Foundations of Chongqing","grantNumber":"2011-65"},{"fundingName":"University Key Teacher Supporting Foundations of Chongqing","grantNumber":"2011-65"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2015C009, XDJK2014A009 and XDJK2013B011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spintronic Memristor-Based Neural Network With Radial Basis Function for Robotic Manipulator Control Implementation","sourcePdf":"tsmc-duan-2453138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095326S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7434135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7434135","articleId":"7247753","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7247755,"authors":[{"name":"Kae Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7247755/kchoi-2477351-small.gif","p":["Kae Won Choi (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in civil, urban, and geosystem engineering, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2007, respectively.

The energy beamforming is used to enhance the RF energy transfer efficiency by concentrating the radiated power on target nodes. Each wireless node is equipped with an energy queue and a data queue. We propose an algorithm that minimizes the expected energy transmission power from the AP while stabilizing the data queues of all nodes. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm that adaptively decides the beamforming vector, the data scheduling, and the data transmission power, only based on the current state of the energy and the data queues. The proposed algorithm dynamically steers the energy beam to nodes that currently have low energy in the energy queue. We apply the Lyapunov optimization technique to design such an algorithm.

The problem is modeled as a utility proportional fair maximization problem subject to traffic demand, spectrum heterogeneity, and exclusive spectrum sharing constraints. Specifically, the optimization problem is formulated as a binary linear programming (BLP) problem. Due to its integrality properties, the BLP is anticipated to be NP-hard. However, this paper proves that the optimal solution of the formulated BLP can be found in polynomial time using linear programming (LP) because of its total unimodular constraint matrix. The proposed solution is a spectrum-aware allocation design that ensures a fair spectrum sharing among cells based on their current traffic loads while considering the unique characteristics of their radio-frequency (RF) environment. Simulation results reveal that the proposed spectrum-aware proportional weighted fair allocation leads to improved system performance while effectively dealing with spectrum heterogeneity and time-varying traffic demands. The results also indicate that the proposed spectrum-allocation design is quite robust to traffic estimation and spectrum sensing errors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6628","endPage":"6635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247756.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation for Multicell Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks With Varying Spectrum Availability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7247756/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation for Multicell Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks With Varying Spectrum Availability","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210012","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resource Allocation for Multicell Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks With Varying Spectrum Availability","sourcePdf":"tvt-banysalameh-2477432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066123S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247756","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7247758,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxiang Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7247758/jiang-2477518-small.gif","p":["\n\nYunxiang Jiang (S'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Beijing \nJiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we jointly consider three different transmission modes in cooperative OFDMA systems, i.e., direct transmission (DT) mode, half-duplex (HD) relay cooperative transmission (HDRCT) mode, and full-duplex (FD) relay transmission (FDRT) mode. The joint optimization problem of transmission mode selection, subcarrier assignment, relay selection, subcarrier pairing, and power allocation (PA) is investigated. In this paper, we transform the binary assignment problem into a maximum-weighted bipartite matching problem, which can be solved by the classical Hungarian method. Based on the dual method, we solve the joint PA and binary assignment problem iteratively. Specifically, since the direct link is considered interference in the FD relay transmission mode, the PA problem in FD relay transmission mode is nontrivial. Thus, we provide a novel hierarchical dual method to solve the PA problem in FD relay transmission mode. In addition, in HDRCT mode, the joint transmission of both the source and relay is taken into account, and we provide a simple and insightful PA scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the overall system throughput, compared with previous works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDMA Hybrid Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Systems With Direct Links","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247758.pdf","startPage":"6101","endPage":"6118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDMA Hybrid Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Systems With Direct Links","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7247758/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210036","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372095"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G-YBAQ and 4-BCBG"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDMA Hybrid Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Systems With Direct Links","sourcePdf":"tvt-lau-2477518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138461S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247758","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247760,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Soleimani-Nasab","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Graduate University of Advanced Technology, Kerman, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7247760/solei-2477400-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Soleimani-Nasab (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) was born in Kerman, Iran, in 1984.

They are particularly useful for filling the connectivity gap between the radio frequency (RF) access network and the fiber optic-based backbone network. To address this combined use, there has been a growing interest in so-called mixed RF/FSO systems where RF transmission is used at one hop and FSO transmission at the other in a dual-hop configuration. In this paper, we investigate the performance of mixed RF/FSO systems along with a direct RF link where the FSO link and RF links, respectively, experience double generalized gamma turbulence with pointing error and Nakagami-m fading. Moreover, the effect of cochannel interference is considered at both relay and destination. Under the assumption of amplify-and-forward relaying and selection combining at the destination, we derive closed form expressions for outage probability and bit error probability in terms of Meijer's-G and two-variate Fox-H functions. Our analysis provides a generalized framework for several existing results, since our adopted turbulence and fading statistical models are the most general ones. Based on the high signal-to-noise-ratio analysis, we further provide a diversity gain analysis and discuss the bottlenecks in the mixed RF/FSO systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697442","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7247760/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Performance Analysis of Mixed RF/FSO Cooperative Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE International Workshop Optical Wireless Communications"},{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-157-2-051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"B0126-15-1078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Performance Analysis of Mixed RF/FSO Cooperative Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-soleimaninasab-2477400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104308S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7247760","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7247761,"authors":[{"name":"Weili Nie","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7247761/nie-2477374-small.gif","p":["\n\nWeili Nie received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science \nand Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, \nChina, in 2015.

However, the dense and random deployment of small cells and their uncoordinated operation raise important concerns about energy efficiency. On the other hand, discontinuous transmission (DTX) mode at the base station (BS) serves as an effective technology to improve energy efficiency of the overall system. In this paper, we investigate energy efficiency under a finite local delay constraint in the downlink HetNets with the random DTX scheme. Using a stochastic-geometry-based model, we derive the local delay and energy efficiency in a general case and obtain closed-form expressions in some special cases. These results give insights into the effect of key system parameters, such as path-loss exponents, BS densities, signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) threshold, and mute probability on system performance. We also provide the low-rate and high-rate asymptotic behavior of the maximum energy efficiency. It is analytically shown that it is less energy efficient to apply the random DTX scheme in the low-rate regime. In the high-rate regime, however, a random DTX scheme is essential to achieve the finite local delay and higher energy efficiency. Finally, we extend the analysis to the load-aware DTX scheme, where the mute probability depends on the user activity level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247761.pdf","startPage":"6601","endPage":"6613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HetNets With Random DTX Scheme: Local Delay and Energy Efficiency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Interference","Geometry","Stochastic processes","Fading","Power demand","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobile communication","radiofrequency interference","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIR","signal-to-interference-ratio","stochastic geometry based model","finite local delay","base station","mobile traffic demand","wireless communications","energy efficiency","random DTX scheme","discontinuous transmission mode","HetNets","heterogeneous cellular networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets)","local delay","random discontinuous transmission (DTX) scheme","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"HetNets With Random DTX Scheme: Local Delay and Energy Efficiency","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7247761/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210039","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316004"},{"fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K040685/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HetNets With Random DTX Scheme: Local Delay and Energy Efficiency","sourcePdf":"tvt-nie-2477374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129606S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247761","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247764,"authors":[{"name":"Hakimeh Purmehdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7247764/purme-2477309-small.gif","p":["\n\nHakimeh Purmehdi (S'13) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical \nengineering from Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the \nUniversity of Tehran, in 2009.

The users' data signals are transmitted cooperatively via the base stations (BSs) of a cluster within the sectorized multicell heterogeneous cellular network. Exhaustive search as the optimal scheduling method is extremely complex, particularly for large numbers of users requesting service. We therefore propose suboptimal scheduling algorithms based on the lower complexity metaheuristic stochastic optimization techniques of simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm (PS). Moreover, a hybrid algorithm combining the traits of PS and a greedy scheduler is also proposed. The performance and complexity of these algorithms are evaluated for a heterogeneous system model employing different precoding methods. Assessing the algorithms' performance via computer simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of sum rate is demonstrated, yielding performance very close to that of the exhaustive search at much lower complexity. For each precoding method used in the employed system model, the best corresponding approach to scheduling from our proposed algorithms is determined.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6184","endPage":"6203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity User Scheduling Algorithms for Coordinated Heterogeneous MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity User Scheduling Algorithms for Coordinated Heterogeneous MIMO Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210002","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7247764/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Telecommunications Research Laboratories"},{"fundingName":"Rohit Sharma Professorship"},{"fundingName":"TELUS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004489","fundingName":"Mitacs"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity User Scheduling Algorithms for Coordinated Heterogeneous MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-krzymien-2477309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212277S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247764","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247765,"authors":[{"name":"Weigang Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7247765/liu-2477315-small.gif","p":["\n\nWeigang Liu (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree from Wuhan University of \nTechnology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and the M.Eng. degree from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2011.

In the first scenario, we study the basic random network without a protected zone around the source node. The probability density functions (pdfs) for the composite channel gain with both fading and path loss is derived and used to calculate the probability of secure connection and ergodic secrecy capacity. In the second scenario, we consider the use of secrecy protected zone around the source node to enhance the security in a noise-limited network. Here, we study the following two cases: 1) The eavesdroppers are aware of the secrecy protected zone, and 2) the eavesdroppers are unaware of the secrecy protected zone. Moreover, the distribution of the distances between the origin and random nodes outside the secrecy protected zone is derived. In the final scenario, the interferer protected zones around the legitimate receivers are used to improve the physical-layer security by restructuring the interference. The derived analytical results are verified by the Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the application of secrecy and interferer protected zones lead to significant improvement in security, depending on different system parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In our design, we consider not only the outdated CSI from the legitimate receiver but two distinct scenarios as well, depending on whether the outdated CSI from the eavesdropper is known at the transmitter. Under this consideration, our schemes exploit useful knowledge contained in the available outdated CSI, and based on this, the transmitter decides on whether to transmit or not. We derive new closed-form expressions for the transmission probability, the connection outage probability, the secrecy outage probability, and the reliable and secure transmission probability to characterize the achievable performance. Based on these results, we present the optimal solutions that maximize the secrecy throughput under dual connection and secrecy outage constraints. Our analytical and numerical results offer detailed insights into the design of the wiretap coding parameters and the imposed outage constraints. We further show that allowing more freedom on the codeword transmission rate enables a larger feasible region of the dual outage constraints by exploiting the tradeoff between reliability and security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On\u2013Off-Based Secure Transmission Design With Outdated Channel State Information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247767.pdf","startPage":"6075","endPage":"6088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"On\u2013Off-Based Secure Transmission Design With Outdated Channel State Information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7247767/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210022","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371122, 61471393 and 61501512"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20150718"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150103905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On\u2013Off-Based Secure Transmission Design With Outdated Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2477427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162913S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247767","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247768,"authors":[{"name":"Pierluigi Vito Amadori","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7247768/amado-2477457-small.gif","p":["\n\nPierluigi Vito Amadori (S'14) received the M.Sc. degree (with honors) in \ntelecommunications engineering from the University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy, in 2013.

However, the large number of antennas at the transmitter imposes a high computational burden and high hardware overloads. In line with this, in this paper, we propose a low-complexity antenna selection (AS) scheme that selects the antennas that maximize constructive interference between the users. Our analyses show that the proposed AS algorithm, in combination with a simple matched-filter (MF) precoder at the transmitter, is able to achieve better performances than systems equipped with a more complex channel inversion (CI) precoder and computationally expensive AS techniques. First, we give an analytical definition of constructive and destructive interference, based on the phase of the received signals from phase-shift-keying-modulated transmissions. Then, we introduce the proposed AS algorithm, which identifies the antenna subset with the highest constructive interference, maximizing the power received by the user. In our study, we derive the computational burden of the proposed technique with a rigorous and thorough analysis, and we identify a closed-form expression of the upper bound received power at the user side. In addition, we evaluate in detail the power benefits of the proposed transmission scheme by defining an efficiency metric based on the achieved throughput. The results presented in this paper prove that AS and green radio concepts can be jointly used for power-efficient M-MIMO, as they lead to significant power savings and complexity reductions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07247768.pdf","startPage":"5944","endPage":"5958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Driven Antenna Selection for Massive Multiuser MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Phase shift keying","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","phase shift keying","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference-driven antenna selection","massive multiuser MIMO","low-complexity linear precoders","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","M-MIMO systems","transmitter","low-complexity antenna selection","matched-filter precoder","channel inversion precoder","phase-shift-keying-modulated transmissions","closed-form expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection (AS)","interference optimization","massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO)","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Driven Antenna Selection for Massive Multiuser MIMO","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7247768/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210021","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering, UK"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Interference-Driven Antenna Selection for Massive Multiuser MIMO","sourcePdf":"tvt-amadori-2477457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7247768","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247773,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen Antes","affiliation":["Institute of Robust Power Semiconductor Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7247773/7247773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jochen Antes received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2010.","From 2010 to 2013, he was with the Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), KIT, as a Research and Teaching Assistant.

Only with a detailed insight into the system's behavior, a proper dimensioning and optimization of such wireless links is possible. In this paper we present a performance estimation for broadband wireless links dedicated to multiple tens of Gbit data rate based on known approaches and verify the validity of the estimation by comparison with measurements performed on an E-band wireless frontend. For quadrature phase-shift keying modulated signals and symbol rates of 2 and 5 GBd, the relative error between estimation and measurement is between 1.1 and 2.1%. Furthermore, the estimation approach is used to investigate the performance limiting imperfection of wireless systems operating in the sub-mmw frequency range. Besides the channel noise, the phase noise of the carrier signal is determined as the main limiting factor, especially for systems utilizing extremely broadband modulation bandwidths.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7287831/07247773.pdf","startPage":"3288","endPage":"3299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2467390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2467390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7247773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Estimation for Broadband Multi-Gigabit Millimeter- and Sub-Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Bandwidth","Modulation","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","error statistics","millimetre waves","phase noise","quadrature phase shift keying","radio networks","submillimetre waves","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance estimation","broadband multigigabit millimeter-wave wireless communication links","broadband multigigabit submillimeter-wave wireless communication links","performance limits","nonideal frontend characteristics","in-phase amplitude imbalance","quadrature amplitude imbalance","in-phase phase imbalance","quadrature phase imbalance","local oscillator phase noise","E-band wireless frontend","quadrature phase-shift keying modulated signals","symbol rates","relative error","performance limiting imperfection","wireless systems","submillimeter-wave frequency range","channel noise","limiting factor","extremely broadband modulation bandwidths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","complex modulation","error vector magnitude (EVM)","millimeter-wave (mmw) communication","mmw monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs)","performance estimation","symbol error rate (SER)","wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7247773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Estimation for Broadband Multi-Gigabit Millimeter- and Sub-Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Links","volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7247773/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488882","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Estimation for Broadband Multi-Gigabit Millimeter- and Sub-Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Links","sourcePdf":"tmtt-antes-2467390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075849S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7287831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7287831","articleId":"7247773","onlineDate":"09 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7247774,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7426429/7247774/7247774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.","Currently, he is a hardware system design engineer with TP-LINK Technologies Inc., Shenzhen, China."]},"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085620288"},{"name":"Muhammad S.

It is known that DBS modulates neural activity which changes metabolic demands and thus the cerebral circulation state. However, it is unclear whether there are correlations between electrophysiological, hemodynamic and behavioral changes and whether they have any implications for clinical benefits. In order to investigate these questions, we present a miniaturized system for spectroscopic imaging of brain hemodynamics. The system consists of a 144 \u00d7144, pixel pitch, high-sensitivity, analog-output CMOS imager fabricated in a standard 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process, along with a miniaturized imaging system comprising illumination, focusing, analog-to-digital conversion and \u03bcSD card based data storage.

In the case of this method, the energy for the bonding process comes from three different sources: ultrasonic vibration, pressure (force) and elevated temperature. The pre-heating system contains a heating table and the sample is positioned on the top of it. In order to determine the exact temperature distribution, a numerical model was prepared, which takes into account the specific geometry of the arrangement and the heat transfer methods between the various surfaces. The heat transfer between the ceramic substrate and the heating plate depends on the surface roughness of the materials, and on the pressure which is exerted by the substrate to the heating table. In our investigation, we implemented a physical test setup with K-type thermocouples which can validate stationary numerical models. The temperature difference between the set temperature of the heating table and the measured temperature was 4-5 \u00b0C, while the difference between the set and modeled bond pad's temperatures was only 2-3 \u00b0C, which information will help to set the temperature of the heating tables more accurate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 38th International Spring Seminar on Electronics Technology (ISSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229501/7247949/07248017.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2015 38th International Spring Seminar on Electronics Technology (ISSE)","doi":"10.1109/ISSE.2015.7248017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSE.2015.7248017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the pre-heating process during thermosonic wire bonding by FEM simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Substrates","Heating","Ceramics","Thermal resistance","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ceramics","finite element analysis","heat transfer","lead bonding","process heating","surface roughness","temperature distribution","thermocouples"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-type thermocouples","surface roughness","heating plate","ceramic substrate","heat transfer","temperature distribution","elevated temperature source","pressure source","ultrasonic vibration source","FEM simulation","pre-heating process","thermosonic wire bonding","temperature 2 degC to 3 degC","temperature 4 degC to 5 degC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the pre-heating process during thermosonic wire bonding by FEM simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248017/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15439131","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the pre-heating process during thermosonic wire bonding by FEM simulation","confLoc":"Eger, Hungary","sourcePdf":"E03PAPER.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063919S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229501","isNumber":"7247949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229501","xplore-issue":"7247949","articleId":"7248017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248059,"authors":[{"name":"Laurentiu-Mihai Ionescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Laurentiu-Mihai","lastName":"Ionescu","id":"37398291000"},{"name":"Alin Mazare","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Mazare","id":"37398289100"},{"name":"Adrian-Ioan Lita","affiliation":["Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian-Ioan","lastName":"Lita","id":"37085667094"},{"name":"Gheorghe Serban","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Gheorghe","lastName":"Serban","id":"37398289300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8860-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8859-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"}],"articleNumber":"7248059","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Real-time systems","Optimization","Convergence","Springs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","low-power electronics","real-time systems","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence solution","real time route tracking","intelligent algorithm","genetic algorithm","low power consumption","multicriteria optimization","optimization problem","optimal response","real time response","hardware implementation","hardware integration","FPGA circuit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the authors propose a solution in which an intelligent algorithm - genetic algorithm in our case - is used to generate commands for a robot in real time, so that the robot can determine the optimal moves considering several aspects: route tracking and low power consumption.

Expenditures made for biological pesticides form a huge portion of the total expenses since insects massively reproduce. Observing the reproduction stages of the insects, more effective and smarter pesticizing scenarios can be achieved using biotechnical approaches such as pheromone traps rather than biological ones. Using pheromone traps, the massive reproduction is prevented since the male insects are attracted to the traps and cannot mate with the female ones. The most important disadvantage of the pheromone traps is the expensive labor cost due to the physical patrolling of the traps. Inspection of traps require expert staff who can recognize different kinds of insects. Besides the high labor costs, because of the human factor in the whole cycle, many problems occur such as errors made in counting and recording of the collected data. To overcome these problems, it is possible to integrate camera to the traps in order to lower the labor costs and assure more accurate record of the insect counts and types. Hence the visual data acquired through the traps can be inspected automatically using state of art computer vision techniques. The objective of this paper is to analyze and advance the methods that can discriminate and classify the insects in the traps under challenging illumination and environmental conditions using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In this study, we use background subtraction and active contour models successively to separate the insects from the background and extract the outer boundary of the insects. We extract features using Hu moments (Hu), Elliptic Fourier Descriptors (EFD), Radial Distance Functions (RDF) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). LBP features seem to outperform the rest of the features in recognition rate based on the individual performance of each method. The results from the underlying features are then fused using weighted majority voting to obtain a decision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248113/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15439222","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248113/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vision based automatic inspection of insects in pheromone traps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision based automatic inspection of insects in pheromone traps","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"AgroGeoinformatics2015submission26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061964S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229672","isNumber":"7248073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229672","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248073","articleId":"7248113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248185,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Herrnsdorf","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Herrnsdorf","id":"37670634400"},{"name":"Jonathan J.

Cognitive radios were conceived to combat the inefficiencies and underutilization of the radio-frequency spectrum that were created by the allocation of static frequency bands to \u201clicensed users\u201d. Cognitive radios enable secondary users to recycle underutilized spectrum by temporarily accessing an unused band. However, these radios must constantly monitor the band to ensure that a licensed user does not come online during a transmission. Moreover, monitoring the band introduces overhead because a radio must stop transmitting to monitor the band; otherwise, their own strong transmitted signal would mask the weaker signals coming from distant nodes, a problem known as self-interference.","doi":"10.1109/PHOSST.2015.7248218","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Summer Topicals Meeting Series (SUM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Summer Topicals Meeting Series (SUM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235961/7248161/07248218.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHOSST.2015.7248218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A photonic integrated circuit for full duplex spectrum monitoring in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A photonic integrated circuit for full duplex spectrum monitoring in cognitive radio","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15439529","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248218/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248218/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2015","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A photonic integrated circuit for full duplex spectrum monitoring in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Nassau, Bahamas","sourcePdf":"MP6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02539S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235961","isNumber":"7248161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235961","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248161","articleId":"7248218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248248,"authors":[{"name":"Takaya Yamazato","affiliation":["Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Yamazato","id":"37270510400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7468-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7467-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1099-4742"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8614"}],"articleNumber":"7248248","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Image sensors","Lighting","Vehicles","Optical transmitters","Gallium nitride","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","optical receivers","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensor","visible light communication","V2X","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","vehicle-to-infrastructure communications","VLC receiver"]}],"abstract":"The concepts of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) communications technologies using visible light communications (V2X-VLC) are introduced.

An analytical framework is developed for investigating the SE and EE performance of a two-RAT heterogeneous network (HetNet), based on which it is shown that the feasibility of increasing the SE and EE via offloading is strongly dependent on the load level and the biased offloading factors. For jointly maximizing the SE and EE, a multi-objective optimization problem subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto optimal operational regime in terms of the network parameters. Following this, the constrained Pareto regime is used to quantify the tradeoff between SE and EE as an opportunity cost measure. By opportunistically adapting the small cell BS density and biased offloading factors to the load conditions, we numerically show the range of load values that achieves a good balance in the SE-EE tradeoff while satisfying the specified users' QoS requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248294/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248294/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15437805","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of intra- and inter-RAT offloading on the spectrum/energy efficiency of HetNets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of intra- and inter-RAT offloading on the spectrum/energy efficiency of HetNets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570034939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048803S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248296,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahman Arbi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Abdelrahman","lastName":"Arbi","id":"37085709042"},{"name":"Timothy O'Farrell","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"O'Farrell","id":"37271643800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248296","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Energy efficiency","Electrocardiography","Telecommunication traffic","Power demand","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","energy conservation","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio access networks","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE radio base station power consumption","energy consumption gain","MIMO base station energy efficiency","SISO base station energy efficiency","LTE RAN energy efficiency","overhead power","active transmit antennas","traffic load intensity","spatial multiplexing schemes","multiple input multiple output system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficiency","MIMO networks","Energy Consumption Gain","Power consumption model","LTE"]}],"abstract":"A Novel method to evaluate the energy efficiency of different MIMO schemes is proposed in this paper, where the LTE radio base station power consumption is estimated by using an accurate power consumption model. The energy consumption gain (ECG) is used as a metric, and it is calculated for a MIMO base station with reference to a SISO base station. The results show that the MIMO base station cannot be more energy efficient than the SISO base station if the MIMO overhead power increases by more than 20%. The energy efficiency of MIMO base station can be improved by adapting the number of active transmit antennas according to the offered traffic load intensity. Moreover, the energy efficiency of an LTE RAN is evaluated when the network has been dimensioned by assuming MIMO base stations. The obtained results show that when spatial multiplexing schemes are assumed, and under the same requirements of coverage and traffic load, the MIMO RAN can be more energy efficient than the SISO RAN, even if the MIMO base station overhead power is increased by 60%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of energy efficiency between MIMO and SISO based LTE RANs","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248296","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248296.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of energy efficiency between MIMO and SISO based LTE RANs","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248296/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of energy efficiency between MIMO and SISO based LTE RANs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047382S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248299,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulkadir Celik","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng., Iowa State University, Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Abdulkadir","lastName":"Celik","id":"37085524993"},{"name":"Ahmed E.

In this paper, cognitive radios have been employed to obtain more spectrum by utilizing unused licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. Defining the opportunity cost as the consumed energy per achieved unit of free spectrum, we propose a cooperative sensing scheduling framework to optimize the cost with the consideration of the sensing, reporting and channel switching costs in terms of energy expenditure subject to a licensed user protection threshold. In the proposed scheme, all primary channels are scheduled to be cooperatively sensed within a cycle which consists of rounds. In every round, secondary/unlicensed users (SUs) are first assigned to cooperatively sense the scheduled primary/licensed user (PU) channels. Consequently, SUs report their local sensing results to a fusion center for a global decision. Finally, SUs assigned to sense other PU channels perform channel switching for the next round. This scheme not only provides a feasible network set up in case there does not exist a sufficient number of SUs to satisfy the PU protection in a single round, but also offers an apparent reduction in the opportunity cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248299.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"More spectrum for less energy: Green cooperative sensing scheduling in CRNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248299/","displayDocTitle":"More spectrum for less energy: Green cooperative sensing scheduling in CRNs","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438001","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"More spectrum for less energy: Green cooperative sensing scheduling in CRNs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570046127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054348S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248301,"authors":[{"name":"Rushil Nagda","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rushil","lastName":"Nagda","id":"37085759243"},{"name":"Siddhartha Satpathi","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Satpathi","id":"37074128300"},{"name":"Rahul Vaze","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Vaze","id":"37283640300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248301","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Energy harvesting","Time factors","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter-receiver energy harvesting model","energy source","optimal transmission power profile","ON-OFF profile","transmission time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","offline algorithm","online algorithm","competitive ratio"]}],"abstract":"Transmitter-receiver energy harvesting model is assumed, where both the transmitter and receiver are powered by random energy source.

An online policy with competitive ratio of strictly less than two is also derived.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248301","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248301.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal offline and competitive online strategies for transmitter-receiver energy harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248301/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal offline and competitive online strategies for transmitter-receiver energy harvesting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438040","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248301/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal offline and competitive online strategies for transmitter-receiver energy harvesting","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067504S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248304,"authors":[{"name":"Peter He","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"He","id":"37857507000"},{"name":"Lian Zhao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279828100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248304","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Resource management","Throughput","Fading","Optimization","Cognitive radio","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","multi-access systems","optimal control","optimisation","power control","radio spectrum management","signal detection","telecommunication control","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power control","energy harvesting","cognitive radio networks","spectrum efficiency","green energy","secondary user","interference","primary user","geometric water-filling with peak power constraints","GWFPP","recursion machinery","throughput maximization problem","primal-dual interior point method","PD-IPM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic power allocation","energy harvesting","cognitive radio (CR)","optimization theory and methods","water-filling algorithm with mixed constraints","exact solution"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power control for energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248304","startPage":"92","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248304","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) can be combined with energy harvesting to lift the spectrum efficiency and make use of green energy. The allocated power for the secondary user (SU) needs to have peak power constraints to restrict the interference with the primary user (PU). On the other side, the energy harvesting property of the nodes leads to the causality feature when allocating the harvested energy. In this paper, we apply our recently proposed geometric water-filling with peak power constraints (GWFPP) and recursion machinery to solve the target throughput maximization problem. The proposed algorithm is precisely defined. It provides the exact optimal solution via efficient finite computation. Optimality of the proposed algorithm is strictly proved. Numerical results are presented to illustrate steps and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the exact optimal solutions to the problem. Significant throughput gain can be observed over the well-known primal-dual interior point method (PD-IPM), which only guarantee to generate an \u2208 solution to the problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437306","htmlLink":"/document/7248304/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power control for energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power control for energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570042741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058969S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248305,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayeteville, AR, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406100800"},{"name":"Xianwen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayeteville, AR, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Xianwen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085390189"},{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayeteville, AR, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jingxian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279160700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248305","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Batteries","Energy harvesting","Random processes","Adaptive scheduling","Energy states","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","random processes","scheduling","secondary cells","stochastic processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware adaptive sensing scheduling policy","energy harvesting sensors","finite battery constraint","optimal sensing scheduling policy","energy harvesting sensing system","consecutive sensing epoch selection","long-term average sensing performance optimization","time duration","discrete-time samples","wide-sense stationary random process","Poisson random process","battery level","convergence rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the optimal sensing scheduling policy for an energy harvesting sensing system equipped with a finite battery. The objective is to strategically select the sensing epochs such that the long-term average sensing performance is optimized. In the sensing system, it is assumed that the sensing performance depends on the time duration between two consecutive sensing epochs. Example applications include reconstructing a wide-sense stationary random process by using discrete-time samples collected by a sensor. The randomness of the energy harvesting process and the finite battery constraint at the sensor make the optimal sensing scheduling very challenging. Assuming the energy harvesting process is a Poisson random process, we first identify a performance limit on the long-term average sensing performance of the system without the finite battery constraint. We then propose an energy-aware adaptive sensing scheduling policy, which dynamically chooses the next sensing epoch based on the battery level at the current sensing epoch. We show that as the battery size increases, the sensing performance under the adaptive sensing policy asymptotically converges to the performance limit of the system with an infinite battery, thus it is asymptotically optimal. The convergence rate is also analytically characterized.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248305","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248305.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248305","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sensing scheduling for energy harvesting sensors with finite battery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sensing scheduling for energy harvesting sensors with finite battery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248305/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437904","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sensing scheduling for energy harvesting sensors with finite battery","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092906S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248314,"authors":[{"name":"Qingqing Wu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qingqing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085353771"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao","id":"37283006000"},{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Derrick","lastName":"Wing Kwan Ng","id":"37086444337"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Automation, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085705668"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248314","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":707},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Throughput","Wireless communication","Communication networks","Resource management","Energy consumption","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","multi-access systems","optimisation","power control","radio networks","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient transmission","wireless powered multiuser communication network","WPCN","energy efficiency","joint time allocation and power control","EE maximization problem","wireless energy transfer","WET","wireless information transmission","WIT","closed-form expression","user scheduling problem"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers wireless powered communication networks (WPCN). Our goal is to investigate the maximum network energy efficiency (EE) by joint time allocation and power control while taking account the initial battery energy level of each user. It is shown that the EE maximization problem for the WPCN can be cast into the EE maximization problems for two independent networks, i.e., purely wireless powered communication networks (PWPCN) or initial energy limited communication networks (IELCN). For the PWPCN, we find that: 1) in the wireless energy transfer (WET) stage, the power station always transmits with its maximum power; 2) it is not necessary for all users to transmit signals in the wireless information transmission (WIT) stage, but all scheduled users will deplete all of their energy; 3) the maximum system EE can always be achieved by exhausting all the available time. Based on these observations, we derive a closed-form expression for the system EE based on the user EE, which transforms the original problem into a user scheduling problem that can be solved efficiently. While for the IELCN, we reveal that the most energy-efficient transmission strategy is to only schedule the user who has the highest user EE. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient transmission for wireless powered multiuser communication networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248314","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248314.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient transmission for wireless powered multiuser communication networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248314/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient transmission for wireless powered multiuser communication networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07228S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248316,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad R.

We also analyze the impact of correlated and random sampling processes in the resulting distortion and, in order to gain some insight, we particularize the analysis to the case of fully correlated spatial fields and with an asymptotically large number of sensor nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248331","startPage":"258","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248331.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of correlated sampling processes in WSNs with energy-neutral operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of correlated sampling processes in WSNs with energy-neutral operation","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248331/","accessionNumber":"15437644","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248331/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of correlated sampling processes in WSNs with energy-neutral operation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041465S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248332,"authors":[{"name":"Yongjune Kim","affiliation":["Data Storage Systems Center (DSSC), Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongjune","lastName":"Kim","id":"38666502300"},{"name":"Robert Mateescu","affiliation":["HGST Research, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mateescu","id":"37546071600"},{"name":"Seung-Hwan Song","affiliation":["HGST Research, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Song","id":"38466892400"},{"name":"Zvonimir Bandic","affiliation":["HGST Research, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zvonimir","lastName":"Bandic","id":"37540610200"},{"name":"B.

However, 3D vertical flash memory suffers from a new problem known as fast detrapping, which is a rapid charge loss problem. In this paper, we propose a scheme to compensate the effect of fast detrapping by intentional inter-cell interference (ICI). In order to properly control the intentional ICI, our scheme relies on a coding technique that incorporates the side information of fast detrapping during the encoding stage. This technique is closely connected to the well-known problem of coding in a memory with defective cells. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can effectively address the problem of fast detrapping.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248332","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248332.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding scheme for 3D vertical flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coding scheme for 3D vertical flash memory","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248332/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437499","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248332/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding scheme for 3D vertical flash memory","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070688S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248333,"authors":[{"name":"Veeresh Taranalli","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Veeresh","lastName":"Taranalli","id":"38188143400"},{"name":"Hironori Uchikawa","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironori","lastName":"Uchikawa","id":"37085715405"},{"name":"Paul H.

Information about the read-channel degradation drives advanced signal processing methods in Flash to mitigate its effect. In this context, channel estimation must be ongoing since channel degradation evolves over time and is a function of the number of program/erase (P/E) cycles. This paper proposes a framework for on-line model-based channel estimation using limited channel measurements (reads). This paper uses a channel model characterizing degradation as a function of retention time and the amount of charge programmed and erased. For channel histogram measurements, equal-probability (equal-height) bin placement yields a good approximation to the original distribution using only ten bins (i.e. nine reads). With the channel model and binning strategy in place, this paper explores candidate numerical least squares channel estimation algorithms and ultimately demonstrates the effectiveness of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which provides both speed and accuracy, in an algorithm for voltage allocation.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248335","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogram-based Flash channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248335/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Histogram-based Flash channel estimation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438292","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248335/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histogram-based Flash channel estimation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113067S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248336,"authors":[{"name":"Haleh Tabrizi","affiliation":["EMC / DSSD, Inc"],"firstName":"Haleh","lastName":"Tabrizi","id":"38232740400"},{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37298641800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248336","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Ash","Dynamic programming","Bit error rate","Memory","Threshold voltage","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","error correction","flash memories","Markov processes","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NAND flash","dynamic programming","flash memories","data storage","flash cell wear-and-tear","error-correction coding","ECC","error correction mechanisms","RAID","Markov decision process","bit-error value","look-up table"]}],"abstract":"One of the main attractions for the widespread of flash memories in data storage is their fast read speed. Read speed can potentially be jeopardized when there are a large number of read errors as a result of flash cell wear-and-tear, leakage, and many other factors. Powerful (error-correction coding) ECC techniques are generally employed, but the number of errors that these schemes can correct is limited; therefore, often other sophisticated error correction mechanisms such as RAID need to be invoked, as well, which introduce significant latency. Flash pages that are not ECC correctable are identified as bad pages. By proactively reading pages, decoding the data and comparing the bit-error with a pre-fixed bit-error threshold value one can potentially predict bad pages and remove their content before they become problematic. This paper proposes finding such bit-error thresholds by formulating the proactive read process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Based on Dynamic Programming (DP) an algorithm can then be obtained that selects a maximum bit-error value (threshold) above which pages should be removed. Such threshold values can simply be stored as a look-up table in the controller ahead of time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting bad pages in NAND flash to improve read time: A dynamic programming approach","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248336","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248336.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Predicting bad pages in NAND flash to improve read time: A dynamic programming approach","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248336/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437885","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting bad pages in NAND flash to improve read time: A dynamic programming approach","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570053987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050099S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248337,"authors":[{"name":"Borja Peleato","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Borja","lastName":"Peleato","id":"37708204100"},{"name":"Haleh Tabrizi","affiliation":["DSSD, Inc/EMC"],"firstName":"Haleh","lastName":"Tabrizi","id":"38232740400"},{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37298641800"},{"name":"Jeffrey Ferreira","affiliation":["DSSD, Inc/EMC, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Ferreira"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248337","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":518},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Ash","Error correction codes","Standards","Memory","Cloud computing","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error statistics","flash memories","NAND circuits","RAID","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER-based wear leveling","bad block management","NAND flash memories","ECC correction capability techniques","error correcting codes","RAID","flash page","PE cycles","bad block detection","bit error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248337","abstract":"One of the main challenges keeping flash memories from achieving widespread distribution is their limited endurance. The programming and erasing from re-writes damages the cells, progressively increasing the number of errors until information can no longer be stored reliably. Most manufacturers employ powerful ECC techniques, but there is a limit to the number of errors that these can correct. When the number of errors goes beyond the capability of the ECC, it is necessary to invoke RAID, which introduces significant latency and jeopardizes the speed of the memory if used too often. This paper introduces a method for estimating the BER that a flash page will exhibit after retention and uses this estimate for wear leveling. Instead of leveling out the number of PE cycles in all the blocks, the proposed scheme attempts to wear all the blocks evenly so that they all suffer the same BER. Additionally, the estimate will be used to detect bad blocks, those likely to exhibit a number of errors beyond the ECC correction capability, and retire them from further use.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248337","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248337.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER-based wear leveling and bad block management for NAND flash","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BER-based wear leveling and bad block management for NAND flash","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438169","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248337/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248337/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER-based wear leveling and bad block management for NAND flash","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069252S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248341,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Zhou","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37536763800"},{"name":"Hongli Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280797200"},{"name":"Xiangzhan Yu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiangzhan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37406864200"},{"name":"Junwu Guo","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Junwu","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085566042"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248341","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous resource allocation in cloud computing","abstract":"With the advent of cloud computing, more and more enterprises and individuals are motivated to outsource their local complex applications into the cloud for its great flexibility and economic savings. For cloud server, however, the problem of how to optimize scheduling cloud resources to maximize the resource utilization and incorporate energy optimization is not trivial. In this paper, we present a continuous resource allocation strategy to solve this issue. Specifically, we first map all the remaining resources of the cloud into a ZBtree. Based on this, we propose an efficient resource allocation strategy for processing cloud resource requests, which adopts minimal domination matching as the greedy strategy to navigate the tradeoff space. Moreover, to reduce the rate of application migration, we propose a continuous monitoring strategy which adopts a resource reserve scheme to reduce the probability of application migration to the maximum extent. The extensive experiments further demonstrate the validity of the proposed mechanism with low computation overhead.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Resource management","Encoding","Energy consumption","Cloud computing","History","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous resource allocation","cloud computing","local complex applications","economic savings","flexibility savings","optimize scheduling cloud resources","resource utilization","energy optimization","continuous monitoring strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","continuous monitoring","resource allocation","Z-order curve"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248341","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248341","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248341.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248341/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous resource allocation in cloud computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437265","htmlLink":"/document/7248341/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous resource allocation in cloud computing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065373S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248349,"authors":[{"name":"Haleh Tabrizi","affiliation":["EMC / DSSD Inc."],"firstName":"Haleh","lastName":"Tabrizi","id":"38232740400"},{"name":"Borja Peleato","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Borja","lastName":"Peleato","id":"37708204100"},{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37298641800"},{"name":"Jeffrey Ferreira","affiliation":["EMC / DSSD Inc."],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37085745700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248349","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":419},"abstract":"Two important performance metrics for a storage system are the latency associated with retrieving data from its storage medium and the effective lifetime of its storage medium. Both metrics are directly affected by the number of raw read errors (i.e. errors prior to exploiting error-correction mechanisms). This paper focuses on NAND flash memories, where a read is performed by comparing stored voltages with a threshold voltage. The unwanted variation of stored voltages causes read errors. This paper identifies number of flash program-erase (PE) cycles, time elapsed between writing and reading, and the page number (physical location) as the main sources of voltage variations. It then proposes a method for learning how read thresholds should vary with these parameters such that the storage controller can dynamically vary thresholds and minimize read errors. Lab experiments show that at the flash end-of-life, the proposed method lowers the raw bit-error-rate up to a factor of 6, as compared to manufacturer's default read settings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Threshold voltage","Ash","Training","Mathematical model","Memory","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","error statistics","flash memories","learning (artificial intelligence)","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NAND flash read performance","storage system","storage medium","raw read errors","error-correction mechanisms","NAND flash memories","threshold voltage","flash program-erase cycles","PE cycles","storage controller","flash end-of-life","bit-error-rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248349","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248349","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248349","startPage":"370","endPage":"375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving NAND flash read performance through learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving NAND flash read performance through learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248349/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248349/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438453","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving NAND flash read performance through learning","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570053921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057346S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248350,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parnell","affiliation":["IBM Research-Zurich S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Parnell","id":"37408203300"},{"name":"Celestine D\u00fcnner","affiliation":["IBM Research-Zurich S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Celestine","lastName":"D\u00fcnner","id":"37085552997"},{"name":"Thomas Mittelholzer","affiliation":["IBM Research-Zurich S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mittelholzer","id":"37283098400"},{"name":"Nikolaos Papandreou","affiliation":["IBM Research-Zurich S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Papandreou","id":"37276934000"},{"name":"Haralampos Pozidis","affiliation":["IBM Research-Zurich S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Haralampos","lastName":"Pozidis","id":"37266514000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248350","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"abstract":"An extensive effort is being undertaken by the flash community to develop signal processing and error-correction coding schemes that make use of soft information.

Array readers provide diversity gain to deal with noise and enable the handling of inter-track interference (ITI) as well as multi-track detection. In this paper, an array-reader two-track (AR2T) detection system is studied. We present the design of 2-D equalizer that jointly processes array readback signal streams over two tracks. Such a 2-D equalizer can be designed to approximate a 1-D or a 2-D partial-response (PR) target. It is shown that 2-D PR target can result in less residual ITI. For the detection of signals corresponding to 2-D PR target, we propose a novel symbol-based detection algorithm that processes two input signal streams jointly.

We search the scale factor whose wavelet coefficients increase only when the heartbeats appear, in advance. In the learning phase, the subject sits still without body motion. We avoid using a pseudo frequency to obtain the heart rate. Instead, we use the time interval of each peak on the wavelet coefficients whose scale factor is decided in the learning phase. Thus, although the subject has body motion, the heartbeats are able to be detected. For the evaluation, four types of activities are tested. The R-R interval is used for the evaluation of heartbeat detection. As a result, we confirm that RMSE of the R-R interval reduced on all activities compared to the conventional method. Moreover, the RMSE of the R-R interval did not deteriorate when the distance between the Doppler radar and the subject becomes long.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248368","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248368.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heartbeat detection by using Doppler radar with wavelet transform based on scale factor learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248368/","displayDocTitle":"Heartbeat detection by using Doppler radar with wavelet transform based on scale factor learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437324","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248368/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heartbeat detection by using Doppler radar with wavelet transform based on scale factor learning","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059467S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248388,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Watteyne","affiliation":["Linear Technology, Dust Networks product group"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Watteyne","id":"37317973800"},{"name":"Joy Weiss","affiliation":["Linear Technology, Dust Networks product group"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37085683555"},{"name":"Lance Doherty","affiliation":["Linear Technology, Dust Networks product group"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Doherty","id":"37283747100"},{"name":"Jonathan Simon","affiliation":["Linear Technology, Dust Networks product group"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Simon","id":"37708351400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248388","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1067},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","IP networks","Schedules","Reliability","Wireless communication","Throughput","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network reliability","IP networks","smart cities","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial IEEE 802.15.4e network","network performance","time synchronized channel hopping","SmartMesh IP network","commercial TSCH product","battery lifetime","high density smart building networks","multi hop network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248388","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248388","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"Time Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) is a technique that enables ultra reliable and ultra low-power wireless multi-hop networks, and in which communication is orchestrated by a schedule.

We in this paper propose a traffic-aware Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme to improve the scalability of M2M networks. Unlike traditional ACB scheme, our proposed scheme aim at dynamically regulating the parameter of access probability, called barring factor, based on network load, thus accommodating much more M2M devices as well as lowering the access delay. To achieve this goal, we first develop a Markov-Chain based traffic-load estimation scheme according to the collision status. Then, we propose a spectrum of functions to control the barring factor varying with the estimated traffic load. Also provided is a set of simulations results, demonstrating that our proposed traffic-aware scheme significantly outperforms the traditional ACB scheme in terms of not only access success probability, but also average access delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248390/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437338","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-aware ACB scheme for massive access in machine-to-machine networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-aware ACB scheme for massive access in machine-to-machine networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053851S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248391,"authors":[{"name":"Jenhui Chen","affiliation":["Dept.

Sensors, smartphones, smart vehicles are all around, transforming the physical world into an intelligent environment able to provide context-aware services. To support this, we must propose communication protocols that consider the special requirements of IoT. The 6LoWPAN and RPL protocols were defined for this purpose, enabling IoT devices with scarce resources to get an IPv6 address and connect to the Internet. However, the basic principles of communication have to be adapted also. Instead of using the address of a sensor, we query IoT devices based on their context. Also, we need information from the environment, no matter which IoT device provides it. This is the governing principle of data-centric communication, an area that gets increasing attention and fits perfectly the IoT. Here we propose CAEsAR, a Context-Aware Addressing and Routing scheme. It uses RPL trees and aggregates context information in Bloom-filters along the tree. We compare CAEsAR with an IoT service discovery protocol called TRENDY, and the data-centric protocol called MQTT-SN. Simulations show that CAEsAR generates much less signaling traffic, both in the RPL tree setup phase and when the system adapts to changes of context parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248393.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248393","startPage":"635","endPage":"641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAEsAR: A Context-Aware Addressing and Routing scheme for RPL networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248393/","displayDocTitle":"CAEsAR: A Context-Aware Addressing and Routing scheme for RPL networks","htmlLink":"/document/7248393/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15437239","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAEsAR: A Context-Aware Addressing and Routing scheme for RPL networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075185S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248407,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled M.

The proposed OPP-MC-CDMA system is aided with a minimum-mean square error equalizer combined with nonlinear preprocessing to overcome the effect of bursty noise and multipath fading. We study the performance of this system in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate with various constellation sizes of OPP codes, different noise scenarios and non-linear processor's thresholds. For comparison-sake, the performance of a conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDM) scheme is included. The results reveal that the proposed approach always provides superior performance over the conventional OFDM system with a maximum output SNR gain of up to 5.25 dB. It is also shown that the performance of the OPP-MC-CDMA technique improves significantly with increasing the constellation size of the OPP codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248407","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"722","endPage":"727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal poly-phase MC-CDMA over multipath power-line channels with Middleton class-A noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal poly-phase MC-CDMA over multipath power-line channels with Middleton class-A noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248407/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437600","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal poly-phase MC-CDMA over multipath power-line channels with Middleton class-A noise","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570030031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054045S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248410,"authors":[{"name":"Nir Shlezinger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Israel"],"firstName":"Nir","lastName":"Shlezinger","id":"37085569523"},{"name":"Ron Dabora","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Dabora","id":"37283070000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248410","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","OFDM","MIMO","Smart grids","Time-frequency analysis","Linear systems","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","smart power grids","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time narrowband PLC channels","narrowband power line communications","NB-PLC channels","central communications technology","smart power grids","channel transfer function","CTF","blocklength","ad hoc scheme"]}],"abstract":"Narrowband power line communications (NB-PLC) is the central communications technology for the realization of smart power grids. For this reason, NB-PLC channels have been receiving substantial attention in recent years. These channels are characterized by periodic short-term variations of the channel transfer function (CTF) and strong noise with periodic statistics. In this work, we derive the capacity of discrete-time NB-PLC channels, accounting for the periodic properties of both the CTF and the noise. As part of the capacity derivation, we characterize the capacity achieving transmission scheme, which leads to guidelines for constructing a practical code that approaches the capacity as the blocklength increases. The capacity derived in this work is numerically evaluated and the results show that the optimal scheme achieves a substantial rate gain over previously proposed ad-hoc scheme. This gain is due to optimally accounting for the periodic properties of the channel and the noise.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248410.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the derivation of the capacity of discrete-time narrowband PLC channels","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the derivation of the capacity of discrete-time narrowband PLC channels","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437349","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248410/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the derivation of the capacity of discrete-time narrowband PLC channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095952S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248411,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Ding","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37889819500"},{"name":"Yang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085652905"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, P.

Firstly, a novel cognitive spectrum exploitation framework is proposed in order to utilize the available band efficiently. Subsequently, based on the interference analysis carried out between these systems, two cognitive approaches, namely Carrier Allocation (CA) and Beamforming (BF), are investigated under the considered framework assuming the availability of an accurate Radio Environment Map (REM). The employed techniques allow the flexibility of using additional shared carriers for the FSS downlink system along with the already available exclusive carriers (19.7 - 20.2 GHz), thus increasing the overall system throughput. It is shown that a significant improvement in the per beam throughput as well as in the beam availability can be achieved by applying CA and BF approaches in the considered scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437993","htmlLink":"/document/7248432/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Carrier Allocation and Beamforming for cognitive SatComs in Ka-band (17.3\u201318.1 GHz)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Carrier Allocation and Beamforming for cognitive SatComs in Ka-band (17.3\u201318.1 GHz)","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069111S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248435,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Icolari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Icolari","id":"37085390099"},{"name":"Alessandro Guidotti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Guidotti","id":"37704422900"},{"name":"Daniele Tarchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Tarchi","id":"37275997700"},{"name":"Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Vanelli-Coralli","id":"38268845100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248435","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Sensors","Frequency selective surfaces","Satellites","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","estimation theory","radiofrequency interference","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication capacity","modern multimedia services","spectrum shortage","incumbent user estimation","incumbent user detection","cognitive radio system","SatCom cognitive scenarios","transmission power impairments","joint interference and noise estimation algorithm","incumbent interference","interference estimation technique"]}],"abstract":"The increasing request of communication capacity for the introduction of modern multimedia services has collided with the problem of the spectrum shortage. One of the most known approach is represented by cognitive radios, which are supposed to exploit already deployed frequency bands in use by an incumbent system. Among other cognitive radio features, detection and estimation of the incumbent user are essential for implementing the cognitive radio system avoiding any interference. This is particularly important in SatCom cognitive scenarios due to transmission power impairments. In this paper, we focus on a joint interference and noise estimation algorithm aiming at detecting and estimating incumbent interference, for allowing the coexistence of the two systems. The behavior of the algorithm is analytically derived, and numerical results obtained through computer simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248435","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248435","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"892","endPage":"897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference estimation technique for Satellite cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"An interference estimation technique for Satellite cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248435/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438339","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference estimation technique for Satellite cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570043847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079515S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248438,"authors":[{"name":"Linda M.

A key contribution is development of a three dimensional (3D) equivalent baseband model that incorporates link geometry, antenna radiation patterns and the rotation of the polarization of the radio wave as it passes through the electron plasma of the ionosphere in the presence of Earth's magnetic field. Through simulations of an overhead pass for a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite in night and day ionospheric conditions, we characterize the combined effect of the link geometry and Faraday rotation. We show that Faraday rotation may in fact improve the channel quality. The power transferred from transmitter to receiver including Faraday rotation can be greater than that for a link with no Faraday effects. This occurs when the antenna orientation at the receiver is favourably aligned with the rotated polarization of the incoming radio wave.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric polarization and Faraday effects for VHF satellite communication links","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248438","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248438.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Geometric polarization and Faraday effects for VHF satellite communication links","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248438/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437923","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric polarization and Faraday effects for VHF satellite communication links","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079734S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248440,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Sacchi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI), University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Sacchi","id":"37282261300"},{"name":"Ernestina Cianca","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Ernestina","lastName":"Cianca","id":"37269165900"},{"name":"Tommaso Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37295313400"},{"name":"Mauro De Sanctis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"De Sanctis","id":"37269164200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248440","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Phase modulation","Satellites","Frequency division multiaccess","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency division multiple access","nonlinear distortion","phase modulation","phase noise","satellite communication","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise effect assessment","phase noise effect analysis","constant envelope multicarrier satellite transmission","CE-SC-FDMA","CE-OFDM","nonlinear distortion","phase modulation","time domain","DFT","nonlinear satellite channel","spectral efficiency reduction","EHF band","broadband satellite communication","phase noise mask","angular modulation index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant envelope (CE) modulations","multicarrier modulations","multi-user communications","phase noise","broadband satellite transmission"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248440","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248440.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and assessment of the effects of phase noise in constant envelope multicarrier satellite transmissions","abstract":"Constant-Envelope (CE) multicarrier techniques have been recently proposed in order to enable the use of multicarrier waveforms in channels characterized by severe nonlinear distortions. They are based on a phase modulation applied to the multicarrier signal, generated in the time domain by means of a real-valued DFT. Such techniques, known as CE-OFDM and CE-SC-FDMA, demonstrated their superior performance with respect to conventional OFDMA and SC-FDMA, when applied to nonlinear satellite channels, at the price of reduced spectral efficiency. An open issue still to be evaluated is related to the impact of phase noise on the performance of CE multicarrier systems. This is especially important in view of the use of EHF bands for broadband satellite communications. This paper aims at analyzing the effects of phase noise on CE-OFDM and CE-SC-FDMA, highlighting the different behavior of conventional and CE multicarrier signals in the presence of such impairment. Then, simulation results will be discussed considering two different phase noise masks. The performed analysis demonstrates that CE multicarrier signals have globally better performance when both phase noise and nonlinear distortions are considered. Moreover, the sensitivity to the phase noise is strongly dependent from the modulation order and the angular modulation index.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248440/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15438107","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248440/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and assessment of the effects of phase noise in constant envelope multicarrier satellite transmissions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and assessment of the effects of phase noise in constant envelope multicarrier satellite transmissions","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057075S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248442,"authors":[{"name":"Gervais N.

The vast difference between the characteristics of the desired channels for a user, depending on whether it is connected to the satellite or to the terrestrial station, makes the corresponding performance evaluation very challenging. This paper tackles this issue by using the powerful generalized-K distribution, and offers a unified closed-form analysis for the system performance of both types of connections. In particular, it is revealed that the user's diversity gain depends only upon the minimum between the fading parameter and the shadowing parameter of the desired channel, regardless of the CCI. Also, the coding gain increases with the diversity gain. The effectiveness of the analysis is corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified performance evaluation of integrated mobile satellite systems with ancillary terrestrial component","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248442","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248442.pdf","startPage":"934","endPage":"938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A unified performance evaluation of integrated mobile satellite systems with ancillary terrestrial component","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248442/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438230","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified performance evaluation of integrated mobile satellite systems with ancillary terrestrial component","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062588S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248444,"authors":[{"name":"Julie Neckebroek","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing (TELIN), Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Neckebroek","id":"37398793600"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing (TELIN), Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37085502313"},{"name":"Werner Coomans","affiliation":["Bell Labs Alcatel-Lucent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Coomans","id":"38234571700"},{"name":"Mamoun Guenach","affiliation":["Bell Labs Alcatel-Lucent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mamoun","lastName":"Guenach","id":"37294731000"},{"name":"Paschalis Tsiaflakis","affiliation":["Bell Labs Alcatel-Lucent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Paschalis","lastName":"Tsiaflakis","id":"37298923300"},{"name":"Rodrigo B.

In this scheme, a memory-polynomial-based predistorter and a simple amplitude clipping method are used. No specific filter is used after the clipping function, which reduces the implementation complexity. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach gives significantly better performance compared to the digital predistortion (without clipping) approach for highly distorted OFDM RoF links. Changes in the OFDM signal's PAPR through the RoF link are analysed for the predistortion schemes with and without clipping. As a result of this, a way of optimizing the performance of the clipping/predistortion approach is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248449","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"977","endPage":"981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clipping and predistortion for compensation of OFDM-Radio over Fiber link distortion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clipping and predistortion for compensation of OFDM-Radio over Fiber link distortion","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437626","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clipping and predistortion for compensation of OFDM-Radio over Fiber link distortion","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105604S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248450,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Lorca","affiliation":["Radio Access Networks Innovation Telef\u00f3nica I+D, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Lorca","id":"37077832900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248450","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Time-domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms","Receivers","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine-type communications","cellular communications","DFT-s-OFDM","carrier frequency offset","CFO requirements","coverage enhancements","power spectral density","bandwidth reduction schemes","link-level simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFT-s-OFDM","OFDM","LTE","carrier frequency offset","machine-type communnications","frequency synchronization"]}],"abstract":"One of the growing fields of interest in cellular communications is Machine-Type Communications (MTC). MTC traffic can be characterized in many applications by very low bit rates while requiring a high degree of coverage and reliability. Studies on how to increase coverage and reduce device costs have been extensively performed in DFT-s-OFDM due to its lower peak-to-average power ratio. Among the drawbacks of using DFT-s-OFDM for MTC are the Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) requirements (thus precluding the use of low-cost local oscillators) and poor performance when coverage is limited (thus precluding devices with low transmission power). A common approach for coverage enhancements is to reduce the signal bandwidth in order to increase the power spectral density, but this does not alleviate the frequency offset requirements. This paper proposes an alternative transmission scheme that increases coverage and supports larger frequency offsets compared to classical bandwidth reduction schemes in DFT-s-OFDM. Link-level simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique in terms of coverage and resilience against large frequency offsets, and put into question the traditional approach of reducing bandwidth for coverage improvements in OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing coverage and maximum CFO in DFT-s-OFDM for Machine-Type Communications","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248450","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248450.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Increasing coverage and maximum CFO in DFT-s-OFDM for Machine-Type Communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248450/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing coverage and maximum CFO in DFT-s-OFDM for Machine-Type Communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570024705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05013S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248451,"authors":[{"name":"Silvio Abrate","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Abrate","id":"37397304700"},{"name":"Stefano Straullu","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Straullu","id":"37541424200"},{"name":"Antonino Nespola","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonino","lastName":"Nespola","id":"37270349900"},{"name":"Paolo Savio","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Savio","id":"37541424700"},{"name":"Valter Ferrero","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Valter","lastName":"Ferrero","id":"37282042400"},{"name":"Joana Chang","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Joana","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085413777"},{"name":"Roberto Gaudino","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Gaudino","id":"37272739500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Modulation","Optical fiber LAN","Bandwidth","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","local area networks","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","next generation networks","passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","passive optical network","FDMA-PON","next generation access","next-generation local area network","LAN architectures","FABULOUS European Project","framework program","NG-PON2 power budget","optical network unit","Mach-Zehnder modulator","silicon photonics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access Networks","Coherent Communications","Optical Fiber Communications","Passive Optical Networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we will give an insight to the FABULOUS European Project, pertaining to the 7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n Framework Program, showing a self-coherent passive optical network that employs Frequency Division Multiplexing and is compatible with legacy infrastructures and NG-PON2 power budget specifications, while exceeding them in terms of bit-rate.

Finally, a noise model is derived for the system to complete an end-to-end system model for the tabletop platform.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248462","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248462.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248462","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1059","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A universal channel model for molecular communication systems with metal-oxide detectors","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438161","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A universal channel model for molecular communication systems with metal-oxide detectors","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078441S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7248463,"authors":[{"name":"Gholamali Aminian","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Gholamali","lastName":"Aminian","id":"37085617502"},{"name":"Hamidreza Arjmandi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Arjmandi","id":"37847864300"},{"name":"Amin Gohari","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Gohari","id":"37541810500"},{"name":"Masoumeh Nasiri Kenari","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Masoumeh Nasiri","lastName":"Kenari","id":"37062463200"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["University of Southern California (USC)"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37433818000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248463","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248463","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Receivers","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Channel capacity","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","molecular communication (telecommunication)","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTI-Poisson channel capacity","conventional memoryless Poisson channel","ISI effect","diffusion based molecular communication network","computable finite letter characterization","single hop LTI Poisson network capacity","upper bound","lower bound","mutual information bounding","symmetrized KL divergence","SNR","maximum transmission constraint"]}],"abstract":"The LTI-Poisson model is a natural extension of the conventional memoryless Poisson channel to include memory, and can model the ISI effect in diffusion based molecular communication networks.

In the inbody mobile bionanosensor network, bio-nanomachines migrate in the environment while they release adhesive molecules that bind to a surface in the environment. The concentration gradient of adhesive molecules is thus formed over the surface, and bio-nanomachines migrate based on the gradient to coordinate their behavior. In the non-diffusion-based molecular communication, the formation of concentration gradient of adhesive molecules relies on the mobility of bio-nanomachines and thus the effective communication range may be limited. However, the non-diffusion-based molecular communication can maintain a high and stable concentration of molecules in the environment, allowing bio-nanomachines to detect the concentration to coordinate their behavior. Through mathematical modeling and performance evaluation, this paper demonstrates that the non-diffusion-based molecular communication may apply to induce coordinated behavior among mobile bio-nanomachines in the inbody environment considered in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248466.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1084","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inbody mobile bionanosensor networks through non-diffusion-based molecular communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Production","Nanoscale devices","Mathematical model","Drugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","body sensor networks","gradient methods","mobility management (mobile radio)","molecular communication (telecommunication)","nanobiotechnology","nanosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inbody mobile bionanosensor networks","non diffusion-based molecular communication","bionanomachine mobility","adhesive molecule concentration gradient","concentration detection","mathematical modeling","performance evaluation","coordinated behavior induction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Inbody mobile bionanosensor networks through non-diffusion-based molecular communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248466/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438052","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inbody mobile bionanosensor networks through non-diffusion-based molecular communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570033761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08697S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248470,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Biral","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Biral","id":"37085670853"},{"name":"Davide Zordan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Zordan","id":"37846863900"},{"name":"Andrea Zanella","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Zanella","id":"37286693000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248470","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Nanoscale devices","Resistance","Geometry","Liquids","Junctions","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drops","microfluidics","two-phase flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information coding strategy","droplet-based microfluidic systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Droplet-based microfluidics","T-junction","droplet generation","Pulse Amplitude Modulation","experiments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248470","abstract":"In recent past, researchers have suggested the idea of extending information theory to the microfluidic domain.

Owing to information propagation among the nano-scale components, neuronal communication is recently identified as a potential candidate for nano-networking. This paper elaborates on the concept of molecular synaptic transmission between neurons, aiming to give an insight into the performance of physical end-to-end model according to the cell physiology. The synaptic transmission is investigated from several aspects: the transmitter (pre-synaptic terminal), the channel (synaptic cleft), and the receiver (post-synaptic terminal), with a goal to characterize the propagation of the spiking rate function between neurons. Moreover, some ideas on how to incorporate the impact of astrocytic processes to the neuronal communication are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication theory aspects of synaptic transmission","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248472","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248472.pdf","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Communication theory aspects of synaptic transmission","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248472/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437933","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication theory aspects of synaptic transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086896S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248473,"authors":[{"name":"Bon Hong Koo","affiliation":["School of Integrated Technology, Yonsei University, Korea"],"firstName":"Bon Hong","lastName":"Koo","id":"37085504866"},{"name":"H.

However, multimedia resource provisioning for dispersed user groups poses a challenge and demands innovative technologies. This paper proposes a novel approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimally allocate computational and networking resources to a group of interactive users, such that the group Quality-of-Service (QoS) is maximized. We evaluate the performance of the proposed improved PSO method with respect to the state-of-the-art greedy resource allocation mechanisms and related PSO approaches. The ability to find a feasible solution (i.e., the serving probability) and the accuracy of such solutions are compared for different network topologies. The proposed method demonstrates reduced computational complexity, an up to 40% increase in the serving probability compared to the greedy methods, and up to 60 times faster convergence compared to the basic PSO approach. Overall, the comparable QoS level to the optimal solution suggests that the proposed solution efficiently allocates the resources available in the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248490/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15438387","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248490/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for cloud-based social TV applications using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for cloud-based social TV applications using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083379S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248498,"authors":[{"name":"Xiantao Cheng","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiantao","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Zengqiang Luo","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Zengqiang","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Jinglei Liu","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248498","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Estimation","Receivers","Joints","Training","Millimeter wave communication","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","least squares approximations","millimetre wave devices","radio receivers","radio transmitters","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave communications","MMW communications","in-phase quadrature imbalance","transmitter","receiver","single carrier frequency domain equalization systems","SC-FDE systems","channel variation energy","CVE","channel frequency response smoothness","Rosenbrock search based scheme","least-square scheme","channel information","TX IQI","RX IQI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248498","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248498.pdf","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint estimation and compensation of transmitter and receiver IQ imbalances in millimeter-wave SC-FDE systems","abstract":"For millimeter-wave (MMW) communications, the in-phase quadrature imbalance (IQI) at the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) may severely degrade the system performance, if not compensated. This paper addresses the joint estimation and compensation of TX and RX IQIs for single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems. In particular, we introduce a concept called channel variation energy (CVE) to characterize the smoothness of channel frequency response observed at the receiver. By minimizing the CVE, the expressions relating the TX and RX IQIs are derived in closed form. Based on the expressions obtained, two schemes are proposed to estimate the TX and RX IQIs: i) Rosenbrock search based scheme; 2) least-square (LS) scheme. Once the IQIs are estimated, the channel information can be easily obtained by simple substitution. Therefore, the proposed schemes can separately estimate TX IQI, RX IQI and channel information, which is necessary for SC-FDE. Through simulations compliant with IEEE 802.11ad standard, it is shown that the proposed schemes can achieve the performance close to the ideal case without IQIs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437542","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint estimation and compensation of transmitter and receiver IQ imbalances in millimeter-wave SC-FDE systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint estimation and compensation of transmitter and receiver IQ imbalances in millimeter-wave SC-FDE systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026822S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7248498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248499,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Huang","affiliation":["Communications Technology Laboratory, Laboratory Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, P.R.

In the second stage, based on the corrupt imperfect channel, a low complexity LS estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the compensate the effective PHN and CFO. The complexity of the algorithm is comparable with that of the traditional zero-forcing/MMSE algorithm in MIMO system. The solution does not require explicit knowledge of the PHN model and hence, is very robust to model variations.

Nevertheless, the alignment of transmitter and receiver beams is a time-consuming operation, which introduces an alignment-throughput tradeoff. A wider beamwidth reduces the alignment overhead, but leads also to reduced directivity gains. Moreover, existing mmWave standards schedule a single transmission in each time slot, although directional communications facilitate multiple concurrent transmissions. In this paper, a joint consideration of the problems of beamwidth selection and scheduling is proposed to maximize effective network throughput. The resulting optimization problem requires exact knowledge of network topology, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, two standard-compliant approximation algorithms are developed, which rely on underestimation and overestimation of interference. The first one aims to maximize the reuse of available spectrum, whereas the second one is a more conservative approach that schedules together only links that cause no interference. Extensive performance analysis provides useful insights on the directionality level and the number of concurrent transmissions that should be pursued. Interestingly, extremely narrow beams are in general not optimal.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248501","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248501.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam-searching and transmission scheduling in millimeter wave communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beam-searching and transmission scheduling in millimeter wave communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248501/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam-searching and transmission scheduling in millimeter wave communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030944S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"96","articleId":"7248501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248502,"authors":[{"name":"Jiho Song","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Jiho","lastName":"Song","id":"37085645825"},{"name":"Junil Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Junil","lastName":"Choi","id":"38008392900"},{"name":"David J.

The training pilot of the source device is broadcasted to all destination devices. Subsequently, in each destination device, the proposed detection is separately conducted to detect significant-path-related beam pairs from the channel responses, via exploiting the time resolvability and space sparsity of physical paths. Finally, the training results are successively fed back to the source device. The proposed scheme achieves simultaneous training of multiple devices and multiple paths, and obtains significant reduction of overhead.

However, most of hybrid precoding schemes focus on the full-array structure, which involves a high complexity. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal iterative hybrid precoding scheme based on the more realistic subarray structure with low complexity. We first decompose the complicated capacity optimization problem into a series of ones easier to be handled by considering each antenna array one by one. Then we optimize the achievable capacity of each antenna array from the first one to the last one by utilizing the idea of successive interference cancelation (SIC), which is realized in an iterative procedure that is easy to be parallelized. It is shown that the proposed hybrid precoding scheme can achieve better performance than other recently proposed hybrid precoding schemes, while it also enjoys an acceptable computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248508/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15438212","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Near-optimal hybrid analog and digital precoding for downlink mmWave massive MIMO systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-optimal hybrid analog and digital precoding for downlink mmWave massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057796S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248509,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Rusu","affiliation":["Universidade de Vigo"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37085393293"},{"name":"Roi M\u00e9ndez-Rial","affiliation":["Universidade de Vigo"],"firstName":"Roi","lastName":"M\u00e9ndez-Rial","id":"38277439300"},{"name":"Nuria Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcicy","affiliation":["Universidade de Vigo, Vigo, Galicia, ES"],"firstName":"Nuria","lastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcicy"},{"name":"Robert W.

A key difference relative to lower frequency solutions is that in mmWave systems, precoding/combining can not be performed entirely at digital baseband, due to the high cost and power consumption of some components of the radio frequency (RF) chain. In this paper we develop a low complexity algorithm for finding hybrid precoders that split the precoding/combining process between the analog and digital domains. Our approach exploits sparsity in the received signal to formulate the design of the precoder/combiners as a compressed sensing optimization problem. We use the properties of the matrix containing the array response vectors to find first an orthonormal analog precoder, since sparse approximation algorithms applied to orthonormal sensing matrices are based on simple computations of correlations. Then, we propose to perform a local search to refine the analog precoder and compute the baseband precoder. We present numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements in complexity while maintaining good spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248509","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248509.pdf","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity hybrid sparse precoding and combining in millimeter wave MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity hybrid sparse precoding and combining in millimeter wave MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248509/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438071","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity hybrid sparse precoding and combining in millimeter wave MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152268S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248510,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Kai Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lin-Kai","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37410243800"},{"name":"Sau-Hsuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sau-Hsuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281056700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248510","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":893},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Antenna arrays","Equalizers","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","iterative methods","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","planar antenna arrays","power consumption","precoding","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid radiofrequency beamforming","baseband precoding","downlink MU-MIMO millimeter wave channels","baseband signal processing","downlink multiuser systems","multiple input multiple output systems","dual-polarized planar antenna arrays","power consumption","BB equalizers","power allocation","signal to interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","iterative algorithm","line-of-sight transmission path"]}],"abstract":"A hybrid architecture of radio frequency (RF) beamforming (BF) and baseband (BB) signal processing is presented for downlink (DL) multi-user (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems operating in millimeter wave (mmWave) channels. To avoid the strong spatial correlation and the transmission or reception dead zones caused by the use of single-polarized antenna arrays in mmWave radio, the hybrid architecture is implemented on dual-polarized (DP) planar antenna arrays (PAA). To balance the quality of each data stream of each user under a limited power consumption, an iterative algorithmfor jointly designing the RF beamformers (BFer), BB precoder, BB equalizers, and the power allocation is proposed for the DL MU-MIMO system of using the hybrid architecture. Simulation results show that the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved with the MU-MIMO system that uses the proposed hybrid architecture is only 5~6 dB lower than that of the conventional one which uses 8 times more BB modules for the same 4 \u00d7 4 DP-PAA. Furthermore, the RF BFers obtained by the proposed iterative algorithm provide a better SINR than that of directly steering the RF BFs towards the line-of-sight transmission path.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248510","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248510.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid radio frequency beamforming and baseband precoding for downlink MU-MIMO mmWave channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248510/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid radio frequency beamforming and baseband precoding for downlink MU-MIMO mmWave channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248510/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid radio frequency beamforming and baseband precoding for downlink MU-MIMO mmWave channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050789S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248512,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Bao","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Bao","id":"37589056000"},{"name":"Bengt-Erik Olsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bengt-Erik","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37266269000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248512","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"abstract":"Two channel phase measurement methods of microwave Line-of-Sight Multi-Input Multi-Output (LOS-MIMO) systems are investigated. The main focus of the measurements is the MIMO phase difference which is a practically useful metric to assess LOS-MIMO channel condition and system performance. The MIMO phase difference is mainly determined by antenna positions, ground effects and atmospheric variations. The relation between antenna positions and channel condition was already addressed in a number of earlier works, while the atmospheric impact and the resulting link availability are rarely studied. In order to get insights into the phase variation of LOS-MIMO channels, we have performed measurements in order to study open-air performance of LOS-MIMO systems. Two phase measurement methods, one DSP-based approach and one sinusoidal-tone-based analog technique, are developed and verified in two outdoor test links. The measurements from both methods are in good agreement with the theoretical calculation based on the antenna positions. The on-going long-term measurements will be used in the development of an availability model for LOS-MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248512.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1363","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods and measurements of channel phase difference in 2\u00d72 microwave LOS-MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Phase measurement","Antenna measurements","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two channel phase measurement methods","microwave LOS-MIMO systems","microwave line-of-sight multi-input multi-output systems","antenna positions","ground effects","atmospheric variations","DSP-based approach","sinusoidal-tone-based analog technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Methods and measurements of channel phase difference in 2\u00d72 microwave LOS-MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437383","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods and measurements of channel phase difference in 2\u00d72 microwave LOS-MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059805S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248514,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37711337100"},{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37085378127"},{"name":"Guodong Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37062151400"},{"name":"Changjing Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Changjing","lastName":"Bao","id":"37085368764"},{"name":"Peicheng Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peicheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37085377664"},{"name":"Hao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401099900"},{"name":"Yongxiong Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongxiong","lastName":"Ren","id":"38296701200"},{"name":"Nisar Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nisar","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37533152400"},{"name":"Zhe Zhao","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Martin P.

The reflection is from an ideal reflector parallel to the propagation path. The intra-channel crosstalk effect is measured when a single OAM beam is transmitted, and inter-channel crosstalk effect is measured when 2 multiplexed OAM beams are transmitted. Both simulation and experimental results show that OAM channels with larger OAM number \u2113 tend to have stronger intra-channel crosstalk because less power is received from the direct path and more power is received from the reflected path. This effect is caused by OAM beam divergence, as OAM beams with larger \u2113 spread into a larger beam size and have less power in the beam center. For the same reason, OAM beams of larger \u2113 lead to stronger inter-channel crosstalk with the other OAM channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438299","htmlLink":"/document/7248514/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental measurements of multipath-induced intra- and inter-channel crosstalk effects in a millimeter-wave communications link using orbital-angular-momentum multiplexing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental measurements of multipath-induced intra- and inter-channel crosstalk effects in a millimeter-wave communications link using orbital-angular-momentum multiplexing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070683S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248515,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The behavior of the wireless channel in these bands differ significantly from the sub-6 GHz counterparts. Ray tracing is a complementary effort to detailed measurements in providing quick insight into the coarse channel characteristics. In this paper, we model the 28 GHz outdoor channel through ray tracing using the WinProp tool. We simulate the single base station and multi base station scenarios in the downtown Manhattan area and study channel properties such as coverage and path loss, path diversity and delay spreads. We observe that a typical MMW base station provides coverage to a significant fraction of a 100m cell radius with path diversity, i.e. there exist secondary paths that may sustain the link on the failure of the first path. The improvements to coverage and path diversity with multiple base stations are also characterized. The above channel properties are compared with NYU's [4] results from the same region. We observe a reasonable match for many of the above parameters. The delay spreads with omni and beamformed antennas are also compared. The typical RMS delay spread in a beamformed scenario is seen to be in the order of 20-30 ns which is significantly smaller than the measured values of 100ns or more. This phenomenon is likely due to detailed clutter in the environment not being modeled.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248516","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248516.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage and channel characteristics of millimeter wave band using ray tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248516/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage and channel characteristics of millimeter wave band using ray tracing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248516/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage and channel characteristics of millimeter wave band using ray tracing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055195S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248518,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085380603"},{"name":"Yongxiong Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongxiong","lastName":"Ren","id":"38296701200"},{"name":"Guodong Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37062151400"},{"name":"Yan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37711337100"},{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37088714422"},{"name":"Hao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401099900"},{"name":"Changjing Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Changjing","lastName":"Bao","id":"37085368764"},{"name":"Nisar Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nisar","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37533152400"},{"name":"Martin P.

We first derive expressions for the achievable rate of the SU when it transmits proper and maximally improper Gaussian signals (assuming that the SU is solely limited by the CR constraint). These expressions depend on the channel gains to and from the SU through a single variable. Thereby, we observe that improper signaling is beneficial whenever the SU rate is below a threshold, which depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rate requirement of the PU. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the achievable gain that also depend only on the PU parameters. Then, the achievable rate is studied from a statistical viewpoint by deriving its cumulative distribution function considering a constant received SNR at the PU. In addition, we specialize this expression for the Z interference channel, for which the expected achievable rate is also derived. Numerical examples illustrate our claims and show that the SU may significantly benefit from using improper signaling.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1403","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248519.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of maximally improper signaling schemes for underlay cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of maximally improper signaling schemes for underlay cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437571","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of maximally improper signaling schemes for underlay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047754S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7248519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248520,"authors":[{"name":"Jeroen Van Hecke","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing (TELIN), Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Van Hecke","id":"38246880800"},{"name":"Paolo Del Fiorentino","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Del Fiorentino","id":"37085505732"},{"name":"Riccardo Andreotti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Andreotti","id":"37705897200"},{"name":"Vincenzo Lottici","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Lottici","id":"37085504852"},{"name":"Filippo Giannetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Giannetti","id":"37271966100"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM), Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37085464356"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing (TELIN), Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37085502313"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248520","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"abstract":"We propose a novel resource allocation (RA) strategy for a cognitive radio packet-oriented bit-interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BIC-OFDM) system with decode-and-forward (DF) relays.

We consider a time-division duplex system where uplink training is required and an active eavesdropper can attack the training phase to cause pilot contamination at the transmitter. This forces the precoder used in the subsequent downlink transmission phase to implicitly beamform towards the eavesdropper, thus increasing its received signal power. We derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy rate for matched filter precoding and artificial noise (AN) generation at the transmitter when the number of transmit antennas goes to infinity. For the achievability scheme at hand, we obtain the optimal power allocation policy for the transmit signal and the AN in closed form. For the case of correlated fading channels, we show that the impact of the active eavesdropper can be completely removed if the transmit correlation matrices of the users and the eavesdropper are orthogonal. Inspired by this result, we propose a precoder null space design exploiting the low rank property of the transmit correlation matrices of massive MIMO channels, which can significantly degrade the eavesdropping capabilities of the active eavesdropper.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248525","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Massive MIMO transmission in the presence of an active eavesdropper","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Massive MIMO transmission in the presence of an active eavesdropper","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248525/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437680","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Massive MIMO transmission in the presence of an active eavesdropper","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054336S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"19","articleId":"7248525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248526,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Flordelis","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Flordelis","id":"37070135200"},{"name":"Xiang Gao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"38064624000"},{"name":"Ghassan Dahman","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Dahman","id":"37399249100"},{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Rusek","id":"37283101000"},{"name":"Ove Edfors","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ove","lastName":"Edfors","id":"37266577600"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248526","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":875},"abstract":"Fully-synchronous measurements of a massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) radio propagation channel are presented. We evaluate the ability of a massive MIMO system to spatially separate users located close to each other in line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions. The system consists of a base-station (BS) antenna array equipped with 64 dual-polarized antenna elements (128 ports) arranged in a cylindrical configuration, and eight single-antenna users. The users are confined to a five-meter diameter circle and move randomly at pedestrian speeds. The BS antenna array is located on top of a 20 m tall building and has LOS to the users. We examine user separability by studying singular value spread of the MU-MIMO channel matrix for several subsets of BS antenna array ports, along with sum-rate capacity and achievable sum-rates with both zero-forcing and matched-filtering linear precoders. We also analyze the performance of the user with the lowest rate. Finally, a comparison between the performance offered by the massive MIMO system and that of a conventional MU-MIMO system is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fully-synchronous dynamic measurements of a massive MIMO system. Our investigation shows that even users located close to each other in LOS propagation conditions can be spatially separated in a massive MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248526.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1446","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial separation of closely-spaced users in measured massive multi-user MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Rayleigh channels","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","linear codes","matched filters","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial separation","closely-spaced users","measured massive multi-user MIMO channels","radio propagation channel","base-station antenna array","dual-polarized antenna elements","MU-MIMO channel matrix","sum-rate capacity","achievable sum-rates","zero-forcing","matched-filtering linear precoders","LOS propagation conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-user multiple-input multiple-output systems","MU-MIMO","massive MIMO","large-scale MIMO","MIMO channel measurements","spatial separation","singular value spread","sum-rate capacity","sum-rate","linear precoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spatial separation of closely-spaced users in measured massive multi-user MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437640","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial separation of closely-spaced users in measured massive multi-user MIMO channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160958S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248527,"authors":[{"name":"Gervais N.

However, it has been well recognized that huge training overhead for obtaining channel side information (CSI) is a major handicap in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO. Several attempts have been made to reduce this training overhead by exploiting sparse structures of massive MIMO channels. So far, however, there has been little discussion about how to utilize partial support information of sparse channels to achieve further overhead reduction.

However, channel conditions may dictate that one dimension requires higher channel state information (CSI) accuracy than the other. We propose the use of an additional one bit of feedback information sent from the user to the base station to indicate the preferred domain on top of the feedback overhead of CSI quantization in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems.

In this paper, we focus on the joint subchannel allocation and transmitting-power control for femtocells during the downlink transmissions. Our objective is to minimize the total transmitting power across femtocell access points (FAPs) to facilitate \u201cgreen\u201d mobile communications. We would like to minimize the following criteria: (1) each user's received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) per subchannel and (2) the number of subchannels each femtocell user requires to maintain a reliable quality-ofservice (QoS). Meanwhile, the interference of the users in the underlying femtocells to users in other macrocells should also be restricted. Thus, a new pertinent optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is very complicated to solve in practice. In our work, a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) based on a branchand-bound framework is invoked to simplify the aforementioned MINLP. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated for the effectiveness of our proposed new scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248531","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1476","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248531.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal total-downlink-transmitting-power and subchannel allocation for green cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal total-downlink-transmitting-power and subchannel allocation for green cellular networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248531/","accessionNumber":"15438239","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248531/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal total-downlink-transmitting-power and subchannel allocation for green cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057481S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248534,"authors":[{"name":"Tianxiang Luan","affiliation":["Institute of China Electronic System Engineering Company, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianxiang","lastName":"Luan","id":"37603057100"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"James C.

By investigating the upperbound/lowerbound of the macrocell outage-probability, a suboptimal femtocell transmission strategy is proposed, whose solution leads to the single eigenmode transmission and thus aggressively simplifies the original problem.

Therefore, the design of reliable and efficient UAC protocols is very challenging. Cooperative relay communications is promising for future UAC as it can improve its reliability and extend the data transmission ranges. In this work, we consider the adaptive relay-aided OFDM UAC (RA-UAC) using the amplifyand- forward (AF) protocol. We first present the results of the optimal power allocation between the source and the relay as well as the power distribution over all subcarriers based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, the adaptive power allocation is very challenging. The fast timevarying UAC channels and the long propagation delay can make the CSI feedback outdated and therefore degrade the performance of the RA-UAC system using the optimal power allocation. To overcome this problem, we implement channel prediction to compensate the channel variation during the CSI signal propagation. The recursive least square (RLS) adaptive filter is utilized to predict the future channel impulse response (CIR) due to its low computational cost and small storage size. The approximate mean square error (MSE) of the RLS filter is derived. Simulation results confirm the necessity of channel prediction through MSE and overall system performance comparison.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248542.pdf","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1540","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive relay-aided OFDM underwater acoustic communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","OFDM","Channel estimation","Adaptive systems","Least squares approximations","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","fading","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive relay-aided OFDM underwater acoustic communications","distance-dependent attenuation","long variable propagation delay","doubly-selective fading","cooperative relay communications","adaptive relay-aided OFDM UAC","amplify-and-forward protocol","optimal power allocation","AF protocol","instantaneous channel state information","fast timevarying UAC channels","RA-UAC system","CSI signal propagation","recursive least square adaptive filter","RLS adaptive filter","channel impulse response","CIR","approximate mean square error","MSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive relay-aided OFDM underwater acoustic communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438121","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive relay-aided OFDM underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048623S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248549,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085425011"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085548297"},{"name":"Shuangfeng Han","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuangfeng","lastName":"Han","id":"37085347882"},{"name":"I.

We consider the BS exploits zero-forcing beamformer and zero-forcing receiver. We derive the deterministic approximation of the downlink and uplink sum-rates considering inter-user interference and self-interference, respectively. Based on the analyzed results, we formulate an optimization problem in terms of the number of transmit and receive antennas to maximize the sum of downlink and uplink sum-rates subject to the number of total antennas at the BS. From the optimization problem, the optimal antenna ratio between the number of transmit and receive antennas can be obtained. We analyze that the optimal antenna ratio converges to the ratio between the number of downlink users (K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n) and uplink users (K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">u</sub>\n) as the number of total antennas goes to infinity.

This paper considers the practical transmitter structure that each antenna is only connected to a unique RF chain and optimizes the analog and digital beamforming matrices to maximize the achievable rate with transmit power constraint. Following alternating optimization principle, closed-form relationships between analog and digital precoders are obtained when both amplitude and phase or only phase can be adjusted to form analog beams. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed methods over the existing beam steering method in terms of achievable rate with different scale antenna array. This reveals that the method can be applied to both low and high frequency band communications. When increasing the number of propagation paths, contrast to the traditional beam steering method, the performance of proposed methods becomes better while the complexity almost keeps at an acceptable constant level.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248552","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248552.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternating beamforming methods for hybrid analog and digital MIMO transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248552/","displayDocTitle":"Alternating beamforming methods for hybrid analog and digital MIMO transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438422","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248552/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternating beamforming methods for hybrid analog and digital MIMO transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570053639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051225S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248553,"authors":[{"name":"Yejian Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Germany"],"firstName":"Yejian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716852900"},{"name":"Thorsten Wild","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Germany"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Wild","id":"37586124800"},{"name":"Frank Schaich","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Schaich","id":"37842691800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248553","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Detectors","Wireless communication","Modulation","Decoding","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","data communication","iterative methods","MIMO communication","signal detection","trellis codes","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous massive MIMO system","trellis-based channel estimation","superimposed pilot deployment","multiple input multiple output system","code division orthogonality","iterative channel estimation","turbo effect","data detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for the massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, by deploying superimposed pilots.

Thus, the initial channel estimates can be initially obtained by separating the users with respect to the corresponding code-division orthogonality with robustness against asynchronicity. Further, during a second stage, iterative channel estimation is considered, by integrating a trellis-based channel estimator, which can significantly enhance the channel estimation during the iterations, by reusing the superimposed pilots.

However, employing a very large set of antennas at the transmitter imposes an equally large number of radiofrequency (RF) chains. As a consequence, a MIMO approach for massive systems is prohibitive, as it leads to very high computational burdens and high hardware complexity at the transmitter. In this paper, a low complexity antenna selection (AS) scheme based on constructive interference is presented to reduce hardware complexity. We show that the proposed AS algorithm, combined with a simple matched filter (MF) precoder, outperforms more complex and computationally expensive AS techniques that involve channel inversion (CI) precoding. We derive the computational burdens of the proposed technique and analyze the benefits through the definition of a new power efficiency metric, that combines performances in terms of throughput with the circuit power required.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248554","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248554.pdf","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power efficient massive MU-MIMO via antenna selection for constructive interference optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248554/","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient massive MU-MIMO via antenna selection for constructive interference optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437832","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248554/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient massive MU-MIMO via antenna selection for constructive interference optimization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090954S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248557,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehua Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuehua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085635570"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292831100"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248557","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Computational complexity","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","receiving antennas","relay networks (telecommunication)","search problems","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay source antenna selection","MIMO two-way relay network","joint relay source AS","separated relay source AS","JRSAS","TWRN","relay node","source node","SRSAS","exhaustive search AS algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the open-challenging problem of antenna selection (AS) at both the relay and source nodes in MIMO two-way relay networks (TWRNs).

Such networks are called ultra-dense networks (UDNs). In this paper, we propose a novel distributed scheduling with interference-aware power control for an uplink of the UDN operating with time-division duplex (TDD). In the proposed technique, each user adjusts transmit power according to a pre-determined threshold of generating interference to other cell base stations (BSs) and each BS selects the users having the highest effective channel gains adjusted according to the transmit power of users. We assume that each user has a single transmit antenna and each BSs have M receive antennas. It is shown that the proposed technique with a carefully chosen threshold significantly outperforms the existing distributed user scheduling schemes through extensive simulations. In addition, we prove that the optimal multiuser diversity gain, i.e., log log N is achieved by the proposed technique in each cell even in the presence of intercell interference when S = 1, if the number of users in a cell, K-1 N, scales faster than SNR \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K-1/1-\u03f5</sup>\n for a constant \u03f5 \u2208 (0, 1), where S denotes the number of scheduled users.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248563","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1666","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248563.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed scheduling with interference-aware power control for ultra-dense networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A distributed scheduling with interference-aware power control for ultra-dense networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248563/","accessionNumber":"15438056","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248563/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed scheduling with interference-aware power control for ultra-dense networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05944S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7248566,"authors":[{"name":"Aysha Ebrahim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"firstName":"Aysha","lastName":"Ebrahim","id":"37085393657"},{"name":"Emad Alsusa","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Alsusa","id":"37284811700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248566","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Energy consumption","Switches","Handover","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference minimization","sleep mode based resource allocation","femtocell networks","interference management","maximum likelihood benchmark","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Long Term Evolution (LTE)","OFDMA","Sleep Mode","Interference Management","Resource Allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a solution for interference management in femtocell networks.

Users with two dual-polarized patch antennas at the mobile station (MS), and four equally-spaced dual-polarized patch antennas at the BS are considered. At the BS, the inter-element spacing (i.e., the spacing between the four dual-polarized patch antennas), is varied from half a wavelength to 8 m. For each BS inter-element spacing, the 4 \u00d7 8 MIMO channels are used to evaluate the system's capability separating closely located users. This evaluation is done by means of the correlation matrix distance metric (between each pair of closely located users) and the sum-rate capacity of the system (when 8 equally-spaced closely located users are served simultaneously). It is found that the system is capable of separating closely located users as long as the distance between them and the BS is less than the Fraunhofer distance associated with the BS antenna array. In the measured environment, for both LOS and NLOS propagation conditions, users located as close as 0.5 m from each other, having the same orientation, are separated successfully in the multi-user MIMO sense.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248567","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of the effect of BS antenna inter-element spacing on MU-MIMO separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of the effect of BS antenna inter-element spacing on MU-MIMO separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248567/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437742","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248567/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of the effect of BS antenna inter-element spacing on MU-MIMO separation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045167S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248568,"authors":[{"name":"Mainak Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"38578604400"},{"name":"Alexandros Manolakos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Manolakos","id":"37392684000"},{"name":"Andrea J.

In contrast to prior work on capacity characterizations of such systems, our approach is based on comparing error exponents with an increasing number of receive antennas. We provide an analytical lower bound on the error exponent for both coherent and noncoherent systems, and describe it explicitly for the case of a communication system with PSK constellations. Based on these analytic expressions, we show that noncoherent schemes can significantly outperform coherent schemes in channels with a strong line of sight component, low SNR or a short coherence time. We present numerical comparisons of our analytical BER performance bounds with Monte Carlo simulations for typical PSK constellations, system sizes and fading/noise statistics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437984","htmlLink":"/document/7248568/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coherent versus noncoherent massive SIMO systems: Which has better performance?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent versus noncoherent massive SIMO systems: Which has better performance?","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074621S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248569,"authors":[{"name":"Hei Victor Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hei Victor","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38240086500"},{"name":"Daniel Persson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Persson","id":"37394511600"},{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Erik G.

The optimization problem is solved by finding closed form expressions of the optimal transmit power and then search over the remaining discrete variables. The analysis consists of two parts, the first part investigates the situation when only power consumed in the RF amplifiers is considered. The second part includes both the power consumed in the RF amplifiers and in other transceiver circuits. In the former case having all antennas active while reducing the transmit power is optimal. Adaptive scheme to switch off some of the antennas at the base stations is found to be optimal in the latter case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248569.pdf","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1702","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO at night: On the operation of massive MIMO in low traffic scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","MIMO","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","Uplink","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","minimisation","precoding","radiofrequency amplifiers","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO","low traffic scenarios","maximum ratio transmission scheme","MRT scheme","zero forcing precoding scheme","ZF precoding scheme","specific rate requirement","optimal transmit power","total consumed power minimization","base station","channel training","optimization problem","closed form expressions","RF amplifiers","discrete variables"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO at night: On the operation of massive MIMO in low traffic scenarios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248569/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437778","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO at night: On the operation of massive MIMO in low traffic scenarios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082983S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248571,"authors":[{"name":"Ernest Kurniawan","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ernest","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37278498600"},{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung","id":"37289977300"},{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278775200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248571","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"abstract":"Massive multiple input multiple output is a promising technology to keep up with the explosive demand of wireless data traffic. The benefits of having a large number of antennas, however, depend on the availability of channel state information (CSI), especially at the transmitter. In frequency division duplex systems, this CSI has to be sent back via the uplink channel, hence incurring a large overhead and degrading the spectral efficiency. Mobility of the users and the large number of antennas exacerbate the problem with frequent tracking of the many timevarying CSI coefficients. This paper presents one approach to address this issue. By tracking only the principal components of the channel gain, and exploiting the wide-sense stationarity of the channel, the amount of required feedback can be reduced significantly. Simulation study shows that the proposed technique is able to achieve high sum-rate with good tracking capability using only limited feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248571.pdf","startPage":"1710","endPage":"1715","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback scheme for massive MIMO in mobile multiuser FDD systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Uplink","Downlink","MIMO","Array signal processing","Interference","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multi-access systems","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited feedback scheme","MIMO","mobile multiuser FDD systems","wireless data traffic","antennas","channel state information","transmitter","frequency division duplex systems","uplink channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback scheme for massive MIMO in mobile multiuser FDD systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437646","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback scheme for massive MIMO in mobile multiuser FDD systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078561S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248572,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

In this paper, we address the challenge of how to synchronize the carrier signals of all antenna units in a large network. We show that mutually coupled digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) can enable in-phase synchronous clocking in largescale systems with transmission delay. Using a phase model of coupled DPLLs including signal filtering and signal transmission delays, we show how the collective frequency and the time scales of synchronization depend on system specifications. To test our theoretical predictions, we designed and carried out experiments, thereby providing a proof-of-principle that mutually delay-coupled DPLLs can provide self-organized synchronous clocking.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248572.pdf","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1721","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of mutually coupled digital PLLs in massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Delays","Voltage-controlled oscillators","MIMO","Frequency synchronization","Couplings","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","digital phase locked loops","MIMO communication","next generation networks","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutually coupled digital phase-locked loops","mutually coupled digital PLL","DPLL","massive multiple-input multiple-output","massive MIMO systems","next-generation wireless networks","wireless communication standard","carrier signal","antenna units","in-phase synchronous clocking","signal transmission delays","self-organized synchronous clocking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of mutually coupled digital PLLs in massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437342","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of mutually coupled digital PLLs in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126618S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248573,"authors":[{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291851800"},{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539031300"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248573","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Antenna arrays","Wireless communication","Floors","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","approximation theory","diversity reception","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-dimension coverage","ultra-densely distributed antenna systems","multifloor pilot reuse","closed-form approximations","linear minimum-mean-squared-error receiver","maximal ratio combining receiver","5G system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248573","abstract":"In this paper, we study the performance of ultradensely distributed antenna system in multi-floor buildings with high user density.

With rising demand for spectrum and systems moving closer to universal frequency reuse, the problem has become more pronounced. Techniques like Fractional Frequency Reuse boost the edgeuser performance at the cost of the spectral efficiency and are therefore sub-optimal. In this paper we investigate interlaced clustering as a solution to the edge user problem for a general distributed cellular transmission system, and explore a multicell Distributed Antenna System as a particular example. In interlaced clustering, different parts of the spectrum use coverage patterns that are spatially shifted (by less than a cell size) replicas of each other. An information theoretic analysis is presented to characterize the proportional fairness boundary point of the achievable rate region. In the process, the joint resource allocation problem is formulated and shown to be convex. As opposed to using interior point methods which are relatively slower, the current paper proposes a novel gradient-search algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem. It is demonstrated that fractional frequency reuse can in fact be represented as a special (albeit sub-optimal) case of interlaced clustering. Simulation results show that interlaced clustering can boost the edge-user rates by a factor of 2 with negligible degradation of rates in the cell interior. Results also show that interlaced clustering outperforms the edge-user rates achieved with fractional frequency reuse by a factor of 1.5. The theoretical results are validated by comparing performance to a practical proportional fairness scheduler.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1732","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248574.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of interlaced clustering in a distributed antenna system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248574/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis of interlaced clustering in a distributed antenna system","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438194","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis of interlaced clustering in a distributed antenna system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087124S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248575,"authors":[{"name":"Hieu Duy Nguyen","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Hieu Duy","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung"},{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248575","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder design for distributed antenna systems (DAS) with limited channel state information","abstract":"A distributed antenna system (DAS) consists of multiple baseband units (BBUs) connecting to distributed antennas (DAs) via dedicated access links.

To tackle this problem, the design of pilot sequences for multi-cell distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is addressed in this paper. We explore this issue by introducing discriminatory treatment of different channel parameters. Generally, the large-scale channel state information (CSI) is predictable and could be regarded as priori information in pilot design, due to its slowly-varying characteristics. In particular, by assuming the large-scale CSI is known a priori, we derive a lower bound on the achievable sum rate in the downlink with a linear detector at the mobile terminal (MT), taking both intercell interference and channel estimation error into account. The problem of pilot sequence design is first formulated, of which the target is to maximize the lower bound of the achievable sum rate with a total pilot power constraint for each cell. Afterwards, we solve the problem by introducing the iterative concave-convex procedure (CCCP) with the demonstration of its convergence.

We address the case of no external synchronization, where one cluster derives its transmit synchronization from a packet received from the previous cluster. For DMIMO system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, frequency offsets between cooperating transmitters or cluster members induce inter-carrier-interference (ICI) in the receivers of the next cluster. Also, the timing offsets between transmitters create additional delay spread potentially necessitating a longer guard interval. Rather than estimating each of the multiple offsets, each receiver estimates just one offset, which implicitly is a channel gain-weighted average, known from our previous work to yield statistically stable synchronization from hop to hop. To effectively suppress the timing and frequency offsets between distributed transmitters, we designed a novel preamble which facilitates this one-step estimation without explicit knowledge of channel gains. The performance improvement of the estimation algorithm is evaluated through simulation as well as experiment on GNU Radio and USRPs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248577.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1750","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization for multi-hop distributed MIMO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Estimation","Synchronization","Frequency estimation","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop distributed MIMO-OFDM","multihop cascaded distributed multiinput multioutput","single antenna radio","cooperative route","DMIMO system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","ICI","channel gain-weighted average","frequency offset suppression","timing offset suppression","distributed transmitter","one-step estimation","GNU Radio","USRP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization for multi-hop distributed MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437371","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization for multi-hop distributed MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084241S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248578,"authors":[{"name":"An-an Lu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"An-an","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085684691"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248578","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","MIMO","Matrices","Channel models","Mathematical model","Approximation methods","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free deterministic equivalent","MIMO MAC capacity analysis","multiple input multiple output multiple access channel","distributed antenna sets","operator-valued free probability framework","Bai method","Silverstein method","Gaussian method","freely independent circular entries","Shannon transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operator-valued free probability","deterministic equivalent","MIMO","MAC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a free deterministic equivalent for the capacity analysis of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC) with distributed antenna sets.

To evaluate the capacity, we use the Shannon transform of the free deterministic equivalent to approximate that of the channel model. The free deterministic equivalent results are easy to compute, and simulation results show that these approximations are numerically accurate and computationally efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248578","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248578.pdf","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A free deterministic equivalent for the capacity of MIMO MAC with distributed antenna sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248578/","displayDocTitle":"A free deterministic equivalent for the capacity of MIMO MAC with distributed antenna sets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437412","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248578/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A free deterministic equivalent for the capacity of MIMO MAC with distributed antenna sets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570034895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07314S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248579,"authors":[{"name":"Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale","affiliation":["Institute National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)"],"firstName":"Tadilo Endeshaw","lastName":"Bogale","id":"38193311400"},{"name":"Long Bao Le","affiliation":["Institute National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)"],"firstName":"Long Bao","lastName":"Le","id":"37963357200"},{"name":"Afshin Haghighat","affiliation":["Interdigital"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Haghighat","id":"37337982800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248579","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1027},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Resource management","MIMO","Scheduling","Fading","Radio frequency","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition","telecommunication links","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","massive MIMO OFDMA system scheduling","hybrid analog-digital beamforming","subcarrier allocation algorithm","multiuser downlink","antenna receivers","subcarrier matrix","low dimensional matrix","eigenvectors","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Hybrid Analog-Digital beamforming","Millimeter wave","Scheduling","RF chain"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new user scheduling and sub-carrier allocation algorithm for multiuser downlink massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with hybrid analogdigital beamforming (HB).

One of the most important advantages of massive MIMO is the capability of supporting a large number of users in the same time-frequency resource, which requires much larger dimensions of matrix inversion for ZF than conventional multi-user MIMO systems. In this case, Neumann Series (NS) has been considered for the Matrix Inversion Approximation (MIA), because of its suitability for massive MIMO systems and its advantages in hardware implementation. The performance-complexity trade-off and the hardware implementation of NS-based MIA in massive MIMO systems have been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the ratio of the number of massive MIMO antennas to the number of users on the performance of NS-based MIA. In addition, we derive the approximation error estimation formulas for different practical numbers of terms of NS-based MIA. These results could offer useful guidelines for practical massive MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248580","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248580.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the matrix inversion approximation based on neumann series in massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the matrix inversion approximation based on neumann series in massive MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248580/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438236","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248580/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the matrix inversion approximation based on neumann series in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570030199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098188S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7248581,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhou","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37405367100"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao","id":"37283006000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248581","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":752},"abstract":"In this paper we consider the multicast transmission in massive MIMO systems where the base station (BS) serves multiple multicast groups simultaneously. Each single-antenna user takes interest in multiple groups but can be only assigned to one interested group during each transmission interval. We study the joint optimization of beamformer design and user grouping under the max-min fairness objective. First, when the BS has the perfect channel state information (CSI) of all users, we show that the asymptotic signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is independent of user grouping and derive the optimal beamformers in closed-form. Second, we consider the imperfect CSI case in time-division duplex (TDD) mode where the BS obtains the downlink channel as the reciprocity of the estimated uplink channel. Instead of estimating every individual user channels, the BS estimates the composite channel of each multicast group. With pilot power control and beamformer power allocation, we propose an optimal user grouping algorithm and a low-complexity suboptimal user grouping algorithm. Numerical and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performances of proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248581.pdf","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1775","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint multicast beamforming and user grouping in massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Resource management","MIMO","Array signal processing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","multicast communication","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","joint multicast beamforming","multicast transmission","base station","multiple multicast groups","single antenna user","max-min fairness objective","channel state information","signal to interference plus noise ratio","time division duplex mode","downlink channel","estimated uplink channel","power control","power allocation","low-complexity suboptimal user grouping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint multicast beamforming and user grouping in massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248581/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437491","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint multicast beamforming and user grouping in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05051S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248582,"authors":[{"name":"Chuili Kong","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuili","lastName":"Kong","id":"37085679994"},{"name":"Caijun Zhong","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Caijun","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37391285800"},{"name":"Michail Matthaiou","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Matthaiou","id":"37396192400"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248582","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"abstract":"We investigate the achievable sum rate and energy efficiency of zero-forcing precoded downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output systems in Ricean fading channels.

Moreover, considering a general power consumption model, the energy efficiency of the system with rank-1 channel means is characterized. Specifically, the impact of key system parameters, such as the number of users N, the number of BS antennas M, Ricean factor K and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \u03c1 are studied, and closed-form expressions for the optimal \u03c1 and M maximizing the energy efficiency are derived. Our findings show that the optimal power allocation scheme follows the water filling principle, and it can substantially enhance the average sum rate in the presence of strong line-of-sight effect in the low SNR regime.

Numerical results verify the analysis and show that WL-BD type precoding methods significantly outperform their conventional counterparts with IQ imbalance and approach the ideal case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely linear block-diagonalization type precoding in massive mimo systems with IQ imbalance","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248584","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248584.pdf","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Widely linear block-diagonalization type precoding in massive mimo systems with IQ imbalance","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248584/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437474","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely linear block-diagonalization type precoding in massive mimo systems with IQ imbalance","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115958S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248586,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085357597"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Xiumin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiumin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085654252"},{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Lei","id":"37532375900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248586","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","MIMO","Antennas","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power allocation","large-scale MIMO relaying system","two-hop secure communication","short-distance interception","LS-MIMO relaying technique","eavesdropper channel state information","CSI","secrecy outage capacity","asymptotic characteristic"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of optimal power allocation at the relay in two-hop secure communications.

The focus of this paper is on the analysis and design of optimal power allocation for the relay, so as to maximize the secrecy outage capacity. We reveal the condition that the secrecy outage capacity is positive, prove that there is one and only one optimal power, and present an optimal power allocation scheme. Moreover, the asymptotic characteristics of the secrecy outage capacity is carried out to provide some clear insights for secrecy performance optimization.

Accurate closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability while considering a fixed gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system. Two special cases of Nakagami-m fading, i.e., Rayleigh (m = 1) and one-sided Gaussian (m = 1/2) are, specifically, focused with capacity-enhancement subcarrier pairing scheme and their performance is analyzed for balanced links, i.e., when SNR of each hop is same, as well as for unbalanced links, i.e., when the SNR of second hop is one-half of the first hop SNR, scenarios. The later which is known as the worst case of fading is, especially, focused for various analysis of the system. The variation of outage probability is shown for different values of fading severity (m) and number of resolvable paths (L) parameters. Numerical results validate analytical work in Nakagami-m fading channel model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248587.pdf","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1812","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of dual-hop OFDM relay system with subcarrier mapping in Nakagami-m fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Indexes","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation","probability","radio links","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-hop OFDM relay system outage probability analysis","Nakagami-m fading channel model","dual-hop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relay system","ordered subcarrier mapping","OSM","amplify-and-forward relay system","AF relay system","subcarrier pairing scheme","balanced link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outage probability","dual-hop","OFDM","subcarrier mapping","Nakagami-m fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of dual-hop OFDM relay system with subcarrier mapping in Nakagami-m fading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248587/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437587","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of dual-hop OFDM relay system with subcarrier mapping in Nakagami-m fading","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071807S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248590,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeyoung Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejoen, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeyoung","lastName":"Song","id":"37085645826"},{"name":"Hojin Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejoen, Korea"],"firstName":"Hojin","lastName":"Song","id":"38666833200"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejoen, Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248590","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":705},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimized production technology","Bit error rate","Greedy algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Fading","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computational complexity","error statistics","femtocellular radio","greedy algorithms","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal caching placement","caching system","femto-base stations","caching files","average bit error rate","BER","Rayleigh flat fading channel","greedy algorithm","file library size","channel diversity gain","caching helpers"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a cell with many caching helpers, such as femto-base stations with memories for caching files.

Base stations (BSs) and users form two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) in the network. Since user-centric cell association may lead to void cells that do not have any users, the power of each BS is controlled in either all-on or on-off mode depending on whether its cell is void or not. The average cell rates for each power control mode are first found and their corresponding energy efficiency is also characterized. The optimal BS density that maximizes the energy efficiency under a given user density is theoretically proved to exist and its value can be found numerically.

Specifically, we perform diversity analysis of MIMO systems that use block-diagonalization and Wiener precoding. It is known that MMSE equalizers and their counterpart Wiener precoding induce a complicated diversity-rate tradeoff that is function of the number of antennas and the operating spectral efficiency in the case of single user. In this paper we provide the diversity-rate tradeoff when Wiener precoding is used in downlink MIMO multiuser system.

The design problem for the transmit precoding and receive equalization is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the sum mean-squared error (MSE) of the two hops subject to separate node transmit power constraints. We show that the equalization filters can be optimized individually at the receiving nodes and take the form of robust Wiener filters. However, due to the loopback interference, the transmissions in the two hops are coupled and the transmit precoding problem boils down to a non-convex power allocation problem in the frequency domain. An alternating optimization approach is proposed to obtain the power allocation where convex programming problems and difference of convex programming problems are solved in an alternating manner. Numerical results are provided to validate the MSE and the achievable rate of the proposed robust schemes, showing that significant performance gains can be achieved compared to conventional half-duplex systems and non-robust full-duplex designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Optimization","Resource management","Robustness","Interference","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","decode and forward communication","equalisers","least mean squares methods","precoding","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust transceiver design","two-hop full-duplex decode-and-forward relay system","single-carrier transmission","frequency-domain equalization","SC-FDE","transmit precoding","receive equalization","sum mean-squared error","MMSE","node transmit power constraints","equalization filters","receiving nodes","robust Wiener filters","loopback interference","nonconvex power allocation problem","frequency domain","alternating optimization approach","convex programming problems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248606","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1925","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248606.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MMSE design for full-duplex decode-and-forward SC-FDE relay systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust MMSE design for full-duplex decode-and-forward SC-FDE relay systems","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15438384","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248606/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MMSE design for full-duplex decode-and-forward SC-FDE relay systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069064S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7248610,"authors":[{"name":"Dushyantha A.

On the one hand, MIMO systems heavily depend on channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. It has also been shown that CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) can improve the link capacity and reliability considerably but with the disadvantage of extra feedback and computational costs. On the other hand, energy efficiency of MIMO systems could adversely increase with the number of antennas in the link. Therefore, there are considerable interests in energy efficient practical transmission schemes for MIMO links without CSIT. In this study, an emerging wireless communication concept which is termed as spatial modulation (SM) is considered for large scale MIMO. The results show that in information-theoretic viewpoint, SM achieves capacity comparable to the open-loop MIMO capacity even though a subset of transmit antennas is activated in every channel use. The reason is both the channel coefficients and input symbols carry information in SM. As a result, SM regains (compensates) the loss of information capacity due to activating a subset of antennas by modulating information in the antenna index. This means that the sum information rate remains high.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248610","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248610.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1945","endPage":"1950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modulation for massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modulation for massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248610/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438314","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modulation for massive MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017948S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","articleId":"7248610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248611,"authors":[{"name":"Gayan Amarasuriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gayan","lastName":"Amarasuriya","id":"37394070900"},{"name":"H.

To this end, asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions are derived by exploiting a time-varying fading channel model for the case in which the number of antennas at the relay grows without bound. Further, the impact of channel estimation errors and co-channel interference on the performance of MIMO MWRNs with massive MIMO is studied, and thereby, the cumulative effect of pilot contamination and outdated/delayed channel state information due to non-orthogonal pilot sequence reuse and channel aging, respectively, is quantified. The closed-form asymptotic SINRs are then used to derive asymptotic symmetric and asymmetric sum rate expressions. These asymptotic SINR and sum rate expressions are independent of the fast fading effects of the wireless channel. Our results reveal that the transmit power of each user can be scaled down inversely proportional to the relay antenna count for the channel aging only case. Nevertheless, when the system is affected by both pilot contamination and channel aging, the user transmit powers can only be scaled inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of relay antennas. Our results show that the effects of channel aging and pilot contamination significantly degrade the system performance even with relays having very large antenna arrays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248611.pdf","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1957","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of channel aging in multi-way relay networks with massive MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Aging","Channel estimation","MIMO","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cochannel interference","fading channels","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel aging","user nodes","scatterers","multiway relay networks","MWRN","massive multiple-input multiple-output","massive MIMO","asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio expressions","asymptotic SINR expressions","time-varying fading channel model","channel estimation errors","cochannel interference","pilot contamination","outdated channel state information","delayed channel state information","non-orthogonal pilot sequence reuse","asymptotic asymmetric sum rate expressions","fast fading effects","wireless channel","transmit power","relay antenna count"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of channel aging in multi-way relay networks with massive MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438057","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of channel aging in multi-way relay networks with massive MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073746S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248612,"authors":[{"name":"Jingchu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingchu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085354170"},{"name":"Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37402649100"},{"name":"Jie Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Gong","id":"37402747500"},{"name":"Zhisheng Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37269009300"},{"name":"Shugong Xu","affiliation":["Intel Labs, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shugong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085343301"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248612","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":463},"abstract":"The baseband-up centralization architecture of radio access networks (C-RAN) has recently been proposed to support efficient cooperative communications and reduce deployment and operational costs. However, the massive fronthaul bandwidth required to aggregate baseband samples from remote radio heads (RRHs) to the central office incurs huge fronthauling cost, and existing baseband compression algorithms can hardly solve this issue. In this paper, we propose a graph-based framework to effectively reduce fronthauling cost through properly splitting and placing baseband processing functions in the network. Baseband transceiver structures are represented with directed graphs, in which nodes correspond to baseband functions, and edges to the information flows between functions. By mapping graph weighs to computational and fronthauling costs, we transform the problem of finding the optimum location to place some baseband functions into the problem of finding the optimum clustering scheme for graph nodes. We then solve this problem using a genetic algorithm with customized fitness function and mutation module. Simulation results show that proper splitting and placement schemes can significantly reduce fronthauling cost at the expense of increased computational cost. We also find that cooperative processing structures and stringent delay requirements will increase the possibility of centralized placement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248612.pdf","startPage":"1958","endPage":"1963","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-based framework for flexible baseband function splitting and placement in C-RAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Delays","Bandwidth","Genetic algorithms","Computational efficiency","Wireless communication","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","genetic algorithms","graph theory","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C-RAN","graph-based framework","flexible baseband function splitting","baseband-up centralization architecture","radio access networks","cooperative communications","massive fronthaul bandwidth","mapping graph weighs","optimum clustering scheme","graph nodes","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based framework for flexible baseband function splitting and placement in C-RAN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438068","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based framework for flexible baseband function splitting and placement in C-RAN","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065809S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248613,"authors":[{"name":"Moonsik Min","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moonsik","lastName":"Min","id":"38548365900"},{"name":"Yo-Seb Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Seb","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37085625220"},{"name":"Gi-Hong Im","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, KR"],"firstName":"Gi-Hong","lastName":"Im"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248613","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Quantization (signal)","MIMO","Transmitters","Null space","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user selection","MIMO broadcast channels","limited-feedback-based block diagonalization","multiple antenna broadcast channels","multiuser interference","channel quality indicator","CQI","diversity gain","multiuser scheduling","determinant-based instantaneous channel capacity","precoding matrices"]}],"abstract":"We consider limited-feedback-based block diagonalization (BD) and user selection for multiple antenna broadcast channels.

To this end, we consider a determinant-based instantaneous channel capacity and propose a new CQI by taking an expectation over precoding matrices that can not be known at the feedback stage.

With this model, we first derive a closed-form upper bound on the achievable ergodic sum-rate before developing necessary conditions to asymptotically maximize the upper bound, with only statistical channel state information at the BS. Inspired by these conditions, we propose a beam division multiple access (BDMA) transmission scheme, where the BS communicates with users via different beams. For BDMA transmission, we design user scheduling to select users within non-overlapping beams, work out an optimal pilot design under a minimum mean square error criterion, and provide optimal pilot sequences by utilizing the Zadoff-Chu sequences. The proposed BDMA scheme reduces significantly the pilot overhead, as well as, the processing complexity at transceivers. Simulations demonstrate the high spectral efficiency of BDMA transmission and the advantages in the bit error rate performance of the proposed pilot sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248614","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"1970","endPage":"1975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam division multiple access for massive MIMO downlink transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beam division multiple access for massive MIMO downlink transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248614/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438186","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam division multiple access for massive MIMO downlink transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061239S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248618,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwei Huang","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085715948"},{"name":"Jun Cai","affiliation":["University of Manitoba College of Medicine, Winnipeg, MB, CA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37278618800"},{"name":"Hong Zhang","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085628660"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248618","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"In this paper, the relay selection issue in buffer-aided relay networks is studied. Different from traditional relay networks, buffer occupancy state has great effects on system performance. Keeping buffers always close to full or empty may lead to potential buffer overflow or data unavailability, which will ultimately affect system throughput and transmission delay jitter. In order to avoid this negative situation, we propose a new threshold-based selection strategy which can achieve the transmission capacity balance between input and output links of every relay buffer. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively prevent buffers from becoming always close to full or empty and, thus, result in great performance improvement compared to the counterpart.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248618.pdf","startPage":"1994","endPage":"1998","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay selection for average throughput maximization in buffer-aided relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Delays","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","jitter","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection","average throughput maximization","buffer-aided relay networks","buffer occupancy state","system performance","buffer overflow","data unavailability","system throughput","transmission delay jitter","threshold-based selection strategy","transmission capacity balance","input links","output links","performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay selection","buffer-aided relay networks","threshold-based selection strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Relay selection for average throughput maximization in buffer-aided relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248618/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437533","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay selection for average throughput maximization in buffer-aided relay networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057204S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248619,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085355396"},{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Korea"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Clerckx","id":"37269077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248619","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Receivers","Wireless communication","MIMO","Joints","Relay networks (telecommunications)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","inductive power transmission","MIMO communication","optimisation","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint wireless information","multiple-input multiple-output relay network","three-node autonomous MIMO relay network","amplify-and-forward","wireless power transfer","WPT","energy-flow-assisted two-phase relaying scheme","relay joint optimization","power optimization","relay channel pairing","energy-flow-assisted scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","relay network","amplify-and-forward (AF)"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates a three-node amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay network, where an autonomous relay harvests power from the source information flow and is further helped by an energy flow in the form of a wireless power transfer (WPT) at the destination. An energy-flow-assisted two-phase relaying scheme is proposed, where a source and relay joint optimization is formulated to maximize the rate. By diagonalizing the channel, the problem is simplified to a power optimization, where a relay channel pairing problem is solved by an ordering operation. The proposed algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the relay and source power, is shown to converge. Closed-form solutions can be obtained for the separate relay and source optimizations. Besides, a two-phase relaying without energy flow is also studied. Simulation results show that the energy-flow-assisted scheme is beneficial to the rate enhancement, if the transmit power of the energy flow is adequately larger than that of the information flow.

It is shown that the closed-form expression is very accurate, and the downlink achievable rate of large-scale DAS is much larger than that of co-located massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with the same antenna configuration.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2016","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248621.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink spectral efficiency of multi-cell multi-user large-scale DAS with pilot contamination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248621/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink spectral efficiency of multi-cell multi-user large-scale DAS with pilot contamination","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437304","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink spectral efficiency of multi-cell multi-user large-scale DAS with pilot contamination","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07437S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248622,"authors":[{"name":"Gayan Amarasuriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gayan","lastName":"Amarasuriya","id":"37394070900"},{"name":"H.

By using transmit power scaling laws at the user nodes, the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions are derived when the antenna counts at the relay and destination are allowed to grow unbound, and thereby, the asymptotic sum rate expressions are obtained. Notably, these asymptotic SINRs and sum rates are independent of the fast fading component of the wireless channel, and consequently, yield a low-complexity medium access control layer and reduced latency in the air interface. Further, the detrimental impact of practical transmission impairments, including (i) imperfect channel state information (CSI), (ii) co-channel interference (CCI), and (iii) pilot contamination is studied by deriving the corresponding asymptotic SINRs and sum rates. For the perfect CSI case, the transmit power at each user node can be scaled down inversely proportional to the antenna count at the relay without degrading the system performance. However, for the imperfect CSI case, the transmit powers of the user nodes can only be scaled down inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of relay antennas. Interestingly, for the perfect CSI case, the presence of CCI neither affects these transmit power scaling laws nor degrades the asymptotic SINR. However, pilot contamination significantly limits the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248622","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user relay networks with massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user relay networks with massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248622/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438340","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248622/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user relay networks with massive MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07548S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248623,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Shengchu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Shengchu","id":"37086371128"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37292404300"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new large-scale antenna system (LSAS) where the base station (BS) is equipped with several classical radio-frequency (RF) chains but massive one-bit integrated information and energy receivers (Rxs). Multiple users with multiple antennas are served simultaneously. This new LSAS is much more energy efficient than massive MIMO because it requires much less classical power-hungry RF chains, and its massive integrated Rxs can harvest new energy. For the uplink multiuser detection (MUD), we develop a practical generalized approximate message passing detector (GAMPD), which exploits the signal prior probability distribution, and the hybrid BS measurements (full ones with both amplitudes and phases from the classical Rxs, and the one-bit amplitude measurements from the integrated Rxs) in a Bayesian manner. GAMPD involves matrix-vector multiplications, small-scale matrix inversions, and parallelized nonlinear operations, so it is suitable for hardware implementation. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed LSAS retains the advantages of massive MIMO, and can even perform similarly as the latter after introducing sufficient number of integrated Rxs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radio frequency","Receivers","Antennas","Multiuser detection","Baseband","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","matrix decomposition","matrix inversion","message passing","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","radio receivers","statistical distributions","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale antenna system","LSAS","massive one-bit integrated energy receivers","massive one-bit integrated information receivers","base station","radio-frequency chains","multiple antennas","uplink multiuser detection","MUD","generalized approximate message passing detector","GAMPD","signal prior probability distribution","hybrid BS measurements","matrix-vector multiplications","small-scale matrix inversions","parallelized nonlinear operations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248623","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248623.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale antenna system with massive one-bit integrated energy and information receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale antenna system with massive one-bit integrated energy and information receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248623/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248623/","accessionNumber":"15438150","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale antenna system with massive one-bit integrated energy and information receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086107S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248624,"authors":[{"name":"Callum T.

Whilst network coding (NC) has been proven as an efficient technique to improve the throughput of ad-hoc networks, it has not been adapted to D2D networks. In this paper, we propose a NC-D2D system, in which we apply NC into the multi-hop D2D communications to enhance its throughput. We then develop a radio resource management (RRM) mechanism that jointly optimises the power control and subchannel allocation for NC-D2D communications. The proposed RRM maximises the throughput of NC-D2D communications while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirements of conventional cellular (CC) UEs. We also investigate how caching capabilities at relay nodes would impact the system performance. Simulation results show that by employing NC and our proposed RRM mechanism, the throughput of multi-hop D2D communications is significantly improved and the time required for exchanging large data files between a D2D pair is dramatically reduced as compared to existing multi-hop D2D schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Relays","Throughput","Optimized production technology","Signal to noise ratio","Quality of service","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cellular radio","channel allocation","cooperative communication","network coding","power control","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation","telecommunication control","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","device-to-device communications","cellular networks","multihop cooperative communications","ad-hoc networks","D2D networks","NC-D2D system","multihop D2D communications","radio resource management","RRM mechanism","power control","subchannel allocation","NC-D2D communications","quality of service","QoS","user equipment","conventional cellular UE","CC UE","relay nodes","D2D pair","multihop D2D schemes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248631","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248631.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network coding in device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network coding in device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248631/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248631/","accessionNumber":"15438433","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network coding in device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062924S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248639,"authors":[{"name":"Peizhong Ju","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering & Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjiing, China"],"firstName":"Peizhong","lastName":"Ju","id":"37085801337"},{"name":"Miaowen Wen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Miaowen","lastName":"Wen","id":"37720016500"},{"name":"Xiang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering & Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjiing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37399092900"},{"name":"Liuqing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Liuqing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279440300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248639","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"abstract":"An effective self-interference (SI) cancellation scheme operated in the digital domain is proposed for the newly-emerging spatial modulated full duplex (SMFD) system.

energy transfer (WET) systems in frequency-selective channels, where the frequency-diversity and energy-beamforming gains can be both reaped by properly learning the channel state information (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET). By exploiting channel reciprocity, a two-phase channel training scheme is proposed to achieve the diversity and beamforming gains, respectively. In the first phase, pilot signals are sent from the energy receiver (ER) over a selected subset of the available frequency sub-bands, through which the sub-band that exhibits the largest sum-power over all the antennas at the ET is determined and its index is sent back to the ER. In the second phase, the selected sub-band is further trained by the ER, so that the ET obtains an estimation for the MISO channel and implement energy beamforming. We propose to maximize the net energy harvested at the ER, which is the total harvested energy offset by that used for the two-phase channel training. The optimal training design, including the number of sub-bands trained and the energy allocated for each of the two training phases, is derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248640/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15438020","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248640/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimized training design for multi-antenna wireless energy transfer in frequency-selective channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized training design for multi-antenna wireless energy transfer in frequency-selective channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062041S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248641,"authors":[{"name":"Cunhua Pan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Cunhua","lastName":"Pan","id":"37071250500"},{"name":"Wence Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wence","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38239178500"},{"name":"Nuo Huang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Nuo","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085353716"},{"name":"Houyu Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Houyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085537339"},{"name":"Jianxin Dai","affiliation":["School of Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Dai","id":"37669335800"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085658150"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248641","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Transmitters","Receivers","Ad hoc networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","array signal processing","computational complexity","energy conservation","MIMO communication","pricing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO ad hoc network","weighted sum energy efficiency","multiinput single output ad hoc network","low-complexity pricing-based distributed beamforming algorithm","computational complexity","information exchange"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing-based distributed beamforming for weighted sum energy-efficiency in MISO ad hoc networks","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","endPage":"2141","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248641","startPage":"2135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248641","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the weighted sum energy efficiency (WS-EE) of a multi-input single-output (MISO) ad hoc network.

Taking into account the discrete nature of the modulation and coding rates (MCRs) used in practice, we formulate a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) problem to jointly design the MIMO precoders, select the MCRs, assign the subchannels, and optimize the energy consumption over multiple time slots with causal and statistical energy arrival information and statistical channel state information. Solving this high-dimensional SDP entails several difficulties: the SDP has a nonconcave objective function, the optimization variables are of mixed binary and continuous types, and the number of optimization variables is on the order of thousands. We propose a new method to solve this NP-hard SDP by decomposing the high-dimensional SDP into an equivalent three-layer optimization problem and show that efficient algorithms can be used to solve each layer separately. The decomposition reduces the computational burden and breaks the curse of dimensionality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online resource allocation for energy harvesting downlink MIMO systems with finite-alphabet inputs","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248642","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248642.pdf","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Online resource allocation for energy harvesting downlink MIMO systems with finite-alphabet inputs","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248642/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438215","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online resource allocation for energy harvesting downlink MIMO systems with finite-alphabet inputs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057869S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7248643,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Fang","affiliation":["Department of National key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401407600"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Department of National key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"38240662700"},{"name":"Su Hu","affiliation":["Department of National key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085763392"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["Department of National key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085762158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248643","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Bit error rate","Upper bound","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","space division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels","MIMO wireless channels","spatial domain","layered space shift keying modulation","LSSK modulation scheme","spatial multiplexing transmission","spectrum efficiency","layer mapping operations","bit-mapping operations","phase shift keying modulation symbols","PSK modulation symbols","transceiver","layered signals","bit error probability","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","SSK modulation","LSSK modulation","ML detection"]}],"abstract":"Space shift keying (SSK) modulation is an emerging transmission technique for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels that exploits spatial domain to convey information.

With the layered structure, LSSK can achieve much higher spectrum efficiency than the conventional SSK modulation system. The proposed LSSK scheme introduces layer mapping and bit-mapping operations at the transmitter to achieve layered SSK modulation directly with low computation overhead. More precisely, leveraging the phase shift keying (PSK) modulation symbols previously known at the transceiver to identify different layers, multiple antennas are activated simultaneously to emit layered signals.

Later works on client-AP association then further take load balancing and fairness into consideration. Those schemes however are not directly applicable in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) WLAN since different combinations of clients result in different throughput of each individual client. Therefore, in this paper, we present a client-AP association algorithm customized for MU-MIMO WLANs. The proposed algorithm jointly solves the problems of client-AP association and MU-MIMO client grouping with consideration of channel correlation among clients. It hence allows a good group of clients, i.e., those with low channel correlation, to together associate with the same proper AP and achieve a high sum-rate. The simulation results show that our MU-MIMO AP association algorithm improves the aggregate throughput by about 11%-28% and 26%-45%, as compared to two common association approaches, i.e., RSSI-based and load-based schemes, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248644","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2154","endPage":"2159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Client-AP association for multiuser MIMO networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Client-AP association for multiuser MIMO networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248644/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437254","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248644/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Client-AP association for multiuser MIMO networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070863S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248645,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Cheng Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Cheng","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37886616500"},{"name":"Chun-Ting Chou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Ting","lastName":"Chou","id":"37655637200"},{"name":"Shi-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-Chung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085451349"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248645","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"Exploitation of underutilized spectrum is an effective approach to meet the explosive demand for wireless communications. When heterogeneous secondary networks (HSNs) are allowed to operate in the same underutilized spectrum, their coexistence becomes a critical issue. This paper considers a coexistence network that involves one spectrum provider (SP) sharing unused spectrum resources to multiple HSNs. To coordinate interference-free spectrum sharing among these HSNs, this paper adopts an auction-based approach and designs an Unilateral Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based Auction for HSNs (UVAH). UVAH has three novel designs that make it a practical and efficient solution. Firstly, effective partition of auction regions takes into account the SP's non-uniform amount of supply units in a target area. Secondly, based on the partition, UVAH provides HSNs with a highly expressive package bidding format to freely specify the amount of demand units and operating regions. Lastly virtual bidders by regions are introduced so as to resolve the revenue deficiency problem of VCG while retaining the property of truthfulness. With these three designs, UVAH maximizes the social welfare of the coexistence network without sacrificing the overall spectrum utilization. Numerical analysis shows that, compared to the existing solutions, UVAH improves spectrum utilization, spectrum revenue and HSN satisfaction by 9.96%, 17.26% and 121.73%, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248645.pdf","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2165","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auction-based spectrum sharing among heterogeneous secondary networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Resource management","Economics","Indexes","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","numerical analysis","radio networks","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","tendering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction-based spectrum sharing","heterogeneous secondary network","wireless communication","interference-free spectrum sharing","unilateral Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based auction for HSN","UVAH","package bidding format","demand unit","virtual bidder","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HSNs","coexistence","VCG","UVAH","effective partition","package bidding","virtual bidder","social welfare"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Auction-based spectrum sharing among heterogeneous secondary networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437848","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction-based spectrum sharing among heterogeneous secondary networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076802S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248646,"authors":[{"name":"Yunchi Shi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Yunchi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085746473"},{"name":"Hassan Osman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Osman","id":"37719836700"},{"name":"Erol Hepsaydir","affiliation":["Star House 20 Grenfell Road, Maidenhead"],"firstName":"Erol","lastName":"Hepsaydir","id":"37425887700"},{"name":"Jiangzhou Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Jiangzhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085742267"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248646","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floors","Mathematical model","Antenna measurements","Wireless communication","Mobile handsets","Standards","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","indoor radio","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor wireless third generation femtocell measurement","indoor propagation model analysis","path loss measurement","Hutchinson 3G femtocell network","indoor line of sight","non-LOS scenario","live signal measurement","indoor channel model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femtocells","measurement","indoor wireless communications","3G","channel model","path-loss model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an indoor propagation model analysis and path loss measurements for a wireless third generation (3G) femtocell in indoor environments.

We have shown in a previous work that this problem is NP-hard and thus cannot be solved optimally in polynomial time unless P = NP. Therefore, new suboptimal algorithms are needed in order to solve it efficiently. Even though, it is very hard to implement the suboptimal algorithm in a centralized fashion because it needs a high amount of information exchange between the base stations and the users and it suffers from a huge computational complexity. Thus, in this paper, we model the problem of user association in HetSNets as a non-cooperative game and we propose a completely distributed algorithm inspired by the theory of learning to solve it. Specifically, we propose a modified win-stay-lose-shift learning model in order to converge to a near optimal user association. We evaluate by simulations the performance of the proposed algorithm and and we show that it is close to the performance of the computationally complex optimal centralized algorithm which assumes complete channel information knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248647","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248647.pdf","startPage":"2172","endPage":"2177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A completely distributed algorithm for user association in HetSNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248647/","displayDocTitle":"A completely distributed algorithm for user association in HetSNets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437770","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248647/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A completely distributed algorithm for user association in HetSNets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047828S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248655,"authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Das","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Communication Eng.

We present a novel and optimal relay selection (RS) rule that minimizes the symbol error probability (SEP) of an average interference-constrained underlay secondary system that uses amplify-and-forward relays. A key point that the rule highlights - for the first time - is that, for the average interference constraint, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the direct source-to-destination (SD) link affects the choice of the optimal relay. Furthermore, as the SINR increases, the odds that no relay transmits increase. We also propose a simpler, more practical, and near-optimal variant of the optimal rule that requires just one bit of feedback about the state of the SD link to the relays. Compared to the SD-unaware ad hoc RS rules proposed in the literature, the proposed rules markedly reduce the SEP by up to two orders of magnitude.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438273","htmlLink":"/document/7248655/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Direct link-aware relay selection for average interference-constrained underlay cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct link-aware relay selection for average interference-constrained underlay cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570023109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089981S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248657,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Systems ICS, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Abdelrahim","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37085662846"},{"name":"Oluwakayode Onireti","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Systems ICS, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Oluwakayode","lastName":"Onireti","id":"37714368200"},{"name":"Muhammad Imran","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Systems ICS, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Ali Imrany","affiliation":["University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, US"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Imrany","id":"37087736441"},{"name":"Rahim Tafazolli","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Systems ICS, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Tafazolli","id":"37280285600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248657","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Channel estimation","OFDM","Training","Satellite broadcasting","Noise","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation-based adaptive pilot pattern","control-data separation architecture","wireless system","pilot symbol aided channel estimation approach","data detection purpose","transmission resource allocation","pilot density","adaptive pilot pattern scheme","logical separation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","LTE pilot overhead saving","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base station","channel estimation","control data separation architecture","correlation","LTE","OFDM","physical layer","pilot","signalling overhead"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248657","abstract":"Most of the wireless systems such as the long term evolution (LTE) adopt a pilot symbol-aided channel estimation approach for data detection purposes. In this technique, some of the transmission resources are allocated to common pilot signals which constitute a significant overhead in current standards. This can be traced to the worst-case design approach adopted in these systems where the pilot spacing is chosen based on extreme condition assumptions. This suggests extending the set of the parameters that can be adaptively adjusted to include the pilot density. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pilot pattern scheme that depends on estimating the channel correlation.

Numerical results reveal the outperformance of the proposed OLR against known linear receivers, mostly in environments with high interference and certain user mobility, as well as that massive MIMO is preferable even in time-varying channel conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248658/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437828","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of user mobility on optimal linear receivers in cellular networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of user mobility on optimal linear receivers in cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570032203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06541S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248663,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"37077756200"},{"name":"M.

However, most lattice reduction algorithms are not designed directly to enhance the bit error ratio (BER) performance. In this paper, a fast lattice reduction (FLR) algorithm for complex-valued matrices, which aims at maximizing the minimal signal to noise ratios (SNR) of all layers, is proposed for V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) systems, employing presorting technique and complex Givens rotation to reduce its computational complexity. The SNRs of all layers are related to the diagonal elements of the triangular matrix via QR decomposition of the channel matrix, and can be optimized by a series of iterations which can be efficiently implemented by exploiting the complex Givens rotation, while the average number of iterations is significantly diminished by utilizing the low complexity pre-sorting technique. Our analysis reveals that the proposed SIC-FLR decoder can significantly reduce the computational complexity without sacrificing any performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same performance as the state-of-art complex LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\u00e1sz) algorithm only with a fraction of complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248665","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248665.pdf","startPage":"2283","endPage":"2288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast complex lattice reduction algorithm for SIC-based MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248665/","displayDocTitle":"A fast complex lattice reduction algorithm for SIC-based MIMO detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437486","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248665/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast complex lattice reduction algorithm for SIC-based MIMO detection","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063888S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248668,"authors":[{"name":"Heecheol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Heecheol","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085626141"},{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37595072100"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248668","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248668","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Interference","Coherence","Algorithm design and analysis","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind interference alignment","K-user MISO broadcast channels","staggered antenna switching scheme","dynamic supersymbol design algorithm","hierarchical BIA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind interference alignment","reconfigurable antenna","supersymbol design","coherence time"]}],"abstract":"We develop a blind interference alignment (BIA) through staggered antenna switching scheme for more realistic channel assumption.

A new type of relays, wireless energy harvesting (WEH)-enabled relays, are thus motivated to support cooperation. In this paper, we consider the use of power splitter (PS) at such relays for a distributed WEH-enabled amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network, where a multi-antenna transmitter communicates with a single-antenna receiver with the aid of several single-antenna WEH-enabled AF relays, in the presence of a single-antenna eavesdropper. Assuming global channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter but local CSI from/to legitimate parties at the relays, the secrecy rate maximization problem is studied to optimize the beamforming vector at the transmitter as well as the PS ratios and the AF coefficients at the relays. We devise an efficient secure relay beamforming (SRB) algorithm to first obtain the PS ratios in a distributed manner and then iteratively adapt the transmit beam and the AF coefficients. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated against other heuristic schemes by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248669.pdf","startPage":"2307","endPage":"2312","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure wireless energy harvesting-enabled AF-relaying SWIPT networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Heuristic algorithms","Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","energy harvesting","receiving antennas","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure wireless energy harvesting-enabled AF-relaying SWIPT networks","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","power splitter","distributed WEH-enabled amplify-and-forward relaying network","multiantenna transmitter","global channel state information","CSI","secrecy rate maximization problem","beamforming vector","efficient secure relay beamforming algorithm","SRB algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure wireless energy harvesting-enabled AF-relaying SWIPT networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437799","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure wireless energy harvesting-enabled AF-relaying SWIPT networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051658S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"14","articleId":"7248669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248675,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Ying","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Ying","id":"37085510314"},{"name":"Frederick W.

We explore the impact of coding to reduce the number of antennas needed for this system to achieve a given performance target. In particular, random coding error exponents for this system are used to determine tradeoff curves between the number of antennas and the blocklengths associated with a guaranteed performance target. However, since random codes have exponentially increasing decoding complexity with increasing blocklength, we also consider a simplified codebook design that has significantly lower encoding and decoding complexity. Simulations suggest that for small blocklengths, the performance of this simplified codebook is competitive with random coding constructions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248676","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248676.pdf","startPage":"2350","endPage":"2355","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of coding in a noncoherent massive SIMO system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of coding in a noncoherent massive SIMO system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438224","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248676/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of coding in a noncoherent massive SIMO system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069163S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248677,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammed Faruk Gencel","affiliation":["University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Muhammed Faruk","lastName":"Gencel"},{"name":"Maryam Eslami Rasekh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California"],"firstName":"Maryam Eslami","lastName":"Rasekh","id":"37404033900"},{"name":"Upamanyu Madhow","affiliation":["University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Upamanyu","lastName":"Madhow"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248677","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","OFDM","Array signal processing","Receivers","Channel estimation","MIMO","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","dispersive channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling wideband distributed transmit beamforming","aggregate feedback","cooperating transmitters","wideband dispersive channel","transmit cluster","feedback-based MIMO systems","narrowband channels","phase discontinuities","receive channel estimation algorithms","N-fold power pooling gain","wideband MIMO systems","distributed MIMO systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248677","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248677","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"We investigate distributed beamforming from a cluster of N cooperating transmitters to a distant destination over a wideband dispersive channel. Feedback from the destination is critical for enabling this. In order to develop protocols that scale to arbitrarily large numbers of cooperating nodes, we restrict attention to aggregate feedback broadcast from the destination to the entire transmit cluster, rather than per-transmitter channel feedback as in conventional feedback-based MIMO systems. We first show that naive application of a one-bit feedback algorithm developed for narrowband channels to each subcarrier in an OFDM system does achieve beamforming gain on each subcarrier, but results in an effective channel at the destination with severe phase discontinuities across frequency, which is not amenable to standard receive channel estimation algorithms. We then show that it is possible to enforce smoothness of phase across frequency by augmenting the feedback to 2 bits per subcarrier, which enables modeling and estimation of the effective channel as sparse in the time domain. Our preliminary results show that, even when the SNR per node is well below the threshold for reliable demodulation, it is possible to bootstrap using the N-fold power pooling gain obtained from incoherent combining of the signals from multiple transmitters, and to attain a significant fraction of the N2-fold beamforming gain using the proposed algorithm. We also discuss a number of open issues, recognizing that this is only a first step in developing scalable, wideband, distributed MIMO systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2356","endPage":"2362","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248677.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling wideband distributed transmit beamforming via aggregate feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248677/","displayDocTitle":"Scaling wideband distributed transmit beamforming via aggregate feedback","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438268","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling wideband distributed transmit beamforming via aggregate feedback","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045647S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248678,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Gui","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng., Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gui","id":"37089149015"},{"name":"Kyoung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Control Eng., Hanbat National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407636000"},{"name":"Zhengyu Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng., Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085506830"},{"name":"Jaehoon Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng., Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085456263"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng., Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248678","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248678","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Wireless communication","Iterative methods","Convergence","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","concave programming","convex programming","covariance matrices","multiuser channels","precoding","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency optimization","nonlinear precoding","multicell MISO broadcast channels","weighted sum energy efficiency maximization","multicell multiuser channel","nonconvex problem","parallel subproblems","base station","dirty paper coding","interference regulation","convex multiple-access channel problem","closed-form power allocation","optimal covariance matrix","locally optimal solution","sum EE maximization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Multi-cell multi-user channel","Dirty paper coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on maximizing weighted sum energy efficiency (EE) for a multi-cell multi-user channel.

In this system model, the optimization problem is difficult to solve since it is in a non-convex fractional form. Hence, conventional algorithms have addressed the problem in an iterative manner for each channel realization that leads to high computational complexity. To tackle this complexity issue, we propose a new simple method based on the fact that the EE maximization is identical to the spectral efficiency maximization for the region of power below the certain transmit power referred to as saturation power. In order to determine the saturation power, we introduce upper and lower bounds of the EE performance by adopting maximal ratio transmission beamforming strategy. Then, we propose an efficient way to compute the saturation power for the maximization problem in closed form. Based on the derived saturation power, we suggest a simplified scheme to calculate EE with low complexity. The saturation power is parameterized by employing random matrix theory, which relies only on the second order channel statistics. Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithm achieves near optimal EE performance with much reduced complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Upper bound","Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Optimization","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency maximization problem","multi-user multiple input single output downlink channels","non-convex fractional form","channel realization","computational complexity","EE maximization","spectral efficiency maximization","saturation power","maximal ratio transmission beamforming strategy","random matrix theory","second order channel statistics","MU-MISO systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248681","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248681.pdf","startPage":"2381","endPage":"2386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple energy efficiency maximization methods for MU-MISO systems based on saturation power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple energy efficiency maximization methods for MU-MISO systems based on saturation power","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248681/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248681/","accessionNumber":"15438480","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple energy efficiency maximization methods for MU-MISO systems based on saturation power","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570044127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095392S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248682,"authors":[{"name":"Junyuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Junyuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37071796600"},{"name":"Huiling Zhu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts University of Kent, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Huiling","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37401249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248682","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":715},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Switches","Antennas","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","interference suppression","millimetre waves","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched-beam based massive MIMO system performance evaluation","multiple input multiple output system","millimeter wave frequency band","mmWave frequency band","suboptimal beam allocation algorithm","complexity reduction","interbeam interference","BS antenna element"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam allocation","performance evaluation","switched-beam systems","massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","inter-beam interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the beam allocation problem with the target of maximizing the sum rate in a switched-beam based massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system working at the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. A simple suboptimal beam allocation algorithm is developed, whose average sum rate performance is shown to be nearly optimal while the complexity is greatly reduced. Different from conventional switched-beam systems, with a large number of beams in the massive MIMO systems, the inter-beam interference closely depends on the beam allocation result. By adopting the suboptimal beam allocation algorithm, the effect of the inter-beam interference is investigated through simulations. The results further show that the average sum rate increases with both the number of BS antenna elements and the number of users even though the inter-beam interference is enlarged with an increasing number of users.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248682","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam allocation and performance evaluation in switched-beam based massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beam allocation and performance evaluation in switched-beam based massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248682/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438386","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248682/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam allocation and performance evaluation in switched-beam based massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058467S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248683,"authors":[{"name":"Zied Bouida","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Zied","lastName":"Bouida","id":"37590982900"},{"name":"Hassan El-Sallabi","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"El-Sallabi","id":"38270768900"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Concordia University, Montreal, Canada","ECE Dept., Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"},{"name":"Khalid A.

Indeed, the reconfigurable properties of RAs can be used as additional degrees of freedom in order to enhance the performance of SSK in terms of throughput, system complexity, and error performance. In this context, we propose a number of SSK-RA schemes using SSK with antenna-state selection while taking advantage of the interplay between RAs and the propagation channel. In this paper, we analyse the performance of the proposed SSK-RA schemes in Rician fading channels in terms of average spectral efficiency (ASE) and average bit error rate (ABER).We also provide several simulation examples through which we corroborate these analytical results. The proposed schemes are shown to enhance the performance of SSK both in terms of ASE and ABER. For the same ASE as SSK, SSK-RA schemes not only provide much better error performance but also considerably reduce the implementation cost and the overall system complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248683.pdf","startPage":"2393","endPage":"2398","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced space-shift keying (SSK) with reconfigurable antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Dipole antennas","Wireless communication","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","error statistics","modulation","radiowave propagation","Rician channels","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable antenna","SSK performance enhancement","space shift keying enhancement","SSK error performance","SSK system complexity","SSK throughput","SSK-RA scheme","antenna state selection","propagation channel","Rician fading channel","average spectral efficiency","average bit error rate","ASE","ABER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna states","performance analysis","reconfigurable antennas","Rician fading","space shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced space-shift keying (SSK) with reconfigurable antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248683/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438294","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced space-shift keying (SSK) with reconfigurable antennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076216S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248684,"authors":[{"name":"Ilia Iofedov","affiliation":["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Iofedov","id":"38520005100"},{"name":"Igor Gutmany","affiliation":["Qualcomm Israel, Israel"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Gutmany"},{"name":"Dov Wulich","affiliation":["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Dov","lastName":"Wulich","id":"37283883500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248684","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Iterative methods","Antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","OFDM","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative precoding","OFDM-MISO system","nonlinear power amplifiers","novel iterative algorithm","transmitter precoding","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing multiple input single output system","nonlinear distortions","RX antenna","low back-off scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MISO","MRT","Precoding","Nonlinear Power Amplifier"]}],"abstract":"A novel iterative algorithm for transmitter (TX) precoding for a Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing - (OFDM-) Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) system with nonlinear Power Amplifiers (PAs) is proposed.

The 28 GHz measurements did not systematically seek the optimum antenna pointing angles and resulted in 33% outage for 39 T-R separation distances within 200 m. The 73 GHz measurements systematically found the best antenna pointing angles and resulted in 14.3% outage for 35 T-R separation distances within 200 m, all for mobile height receivers. Pointing the antennas to yield the strongest received power is shown to significantly reduce RMS delay spreads in line-of-sight (LOS) environments. A new term, distance extension exponent (DEE) is defined, and used to mathematically describe the increase in coverage distance that results by combining beams from angles with the strongest received power at a given location. These results suggest that employing directionality in millimeter-wave communications systems will reduce inter-symbol interference, improve link margin at cell edges, and enhance overall system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248687/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15438369","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting directionality for millimeter-wave wireless system improvement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting directionality for millimeter-wave wireless system improvement","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082576S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7248688,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Wu","affiliation":["Polytechnic School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085508203"},{"name":"Theodore S.

This paper gives examples of today's regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz.

A 3GPP-like statistical channel model that is easy to implement in software or hardware is developed from measured power delay profiles and a synthesized method for providing absolute propagation delays recovered from 3-D ray-tracing, as well as measured angle of departure and angle of arrival power spectra. The extracted statistics are used to implement a MATLAB-based statistical simulator that generates 3-D millimeter-wave temporal and spatial channel coefficients that reproduce realistic impulse responses of measured urban channels.

Hybrid beam-forming uses both RF and digital beam-forming and is a practical way to achieve the antenna array gains required when the large bandwidths available at millimeter wave frequencies are utilized. Since both RF and digital beam-forming are used, there are various possible beam-forming approaches. We investigate a system which uses code book based RF beam-forming with non-code book based digital beam-forming which utilizes sounding reference symbol (SRS) based uplink measurements for TDD operation. For this system we examine different strategies for selecting the RF beams in conjunction with different digital pre-coding schemes to support MU-MIMO. The performances of the different strategies are simulated under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge at the base station and at the mobile station.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248690","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248690.pdf","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user MIMO strategies for a millimeter wave communication system using hybrid beam-forming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248690/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user MIMO strategies for a millimeter wave communication system using hybrid beam-forming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437756","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248690/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user MIMO strategies for a millimeter wave communication system using hybrid beam-forming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065599S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248691,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Guidolin","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy","Communications House, Samsung R&D Institute UK, UK"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Guidolin","id":"38490837900"},{"name":"Maziar Nekovee","affiliation":["Communications House, Samsung R&D Institute UK, UK"],"firstName":"Maziar","lastName":"Nekovee","id":"37303754000"},{"name":"Leonardo Badia","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Badia","id":"37085364841"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37085365323"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248691","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"abstract":"The use of a larger bandwith in the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum is one of the key components of next generation cellular networks.

The node stores the harvested energy in an energy buffer and uses the stored energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We consider a simple transmission policy, which accounts for the fact that in practice the EH node may not have knowledge of the EH profile nor of the UL channel state information. In particular, in each time slot, the EH node transmits with either a constant desired power or a lower power if not enough energy is available in its energy buffer. For this simple policy, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to analyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size energy buffers. Moreover, we take into account imperfections of the energy buffer and the circuit power consumption of the EH node. For a Rayleigh fading DL channel, we provide the limiting distribution of the energy buffer content in closed form. In addition, we analyze the average error rate (AER) and the outage probability of a Rayleigh faded UL channel and show that the diversity order is not affected by the finite capacity of the energy buffer. Our results reveal that, except for high outage probabilities and high AERs, the optimal transmit power by the EH node is less than the average harvested power and increases with the capacity of the energy buffer.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248695","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of wireless powered communication with finite/infinite energy storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of wireless powered communication with finite/infinite energy storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248695/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437575","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of wireless powered communication with finite/infinite energy storage","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029151S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","articleId":"7248695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248699,"authors":[{"name":"Im\u00e8ne Trigui","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Im\u00e8ne","lastName":"Trigui","id":"37391799000"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Alex St\u00e9phenne","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"St\u00e9phenne","id":"37294239900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248699","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Relays","Antennas","MIMO","Wireless communication","Transforms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","cochannel interference","diversity reception","interference suppression","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO relaying","CMGF transform","two-hop multiple antenna amplify and forward system","cochannel interference cancellation","CCI","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","integral transform","complementary moment generating function transform","ergodic capacity","maximum ratio combining","MRC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-hop relaying","Co-channel interference","Ergodic capacity","Multiple antennas","Complementary moment generating function transform (CMGF)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the ergodic capacity of a two-hop multiple-antenna amplify and forward (AF) system, where the relay is subject to co-channel interference (CCI) while the destination is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) only.

Considering the constraints of inter-cell resource allocation posed by CoMP and the difference of load in each cell, a joint clustering and inter-cell resource allocation is necessary. To achieve a feasible solution, the joint optimization is approximated by two sub-problems, i.e. clustering based on load information using game theory and inter-cell resource allocation based graph-coloring algorithms. Thus a two-step joint clustering and scheduling (TS-JCS) scheme is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that TS-JCS has the capability to jointly consider clustering with the requirements on resources.

In such systems, the problem of transmission power balancing between pilot and data is known to have a large impact on the mean square error (MSE) for the received signal and, consequently, on the achievable uplink data rate. In this paper, we derive a closed form expression of the MSE for the received signal as a function of the pilot and data power levels under a per-user sum pilot-data power constraint. As a major contribution, our model is developed for arbitrary channel covariance matrices and it enables us to study the impact of the number of antennas and antenna correlation structures, including the popular 3GPP spatial channel model. Numerical results suggest that the effect of the antenna spacing is limited, but the angle of arrival and angular spread have a strong and articulated impact on the MSE performance. Moreover, as the number of antennas at the base station grows large, we show that a higher percentage of the power budget should be allocated to pilot signals than with a lower number of antennas.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Uplink","Covariance matrices","Mean square error methods","Estimation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antennas","cellular radio","channel estimation","covariance matrices","mean square error methods","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-data balance","multiple antenna systems","single cell single input multiple output system","SIMO system","mobile stations","intracell orthogonal pilots","uplink channel estimation","transmission power balancing","mean square error","MSE","uplink data rate","data power levels","per-user sum pilot-data power constraint","channel covariance matrices","antenna correlation structures","3GPP spatial channel model","antenna spacing","base station"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248715","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248715.pdf","startPage":"2590","endPage":"2596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of antenna correlation on the pilot-data balance in multiple antenna systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of antenna correlation on the pilot-data balance in multiple antenna systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248715/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248715/","accessionNumber":"15438260","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of antenna correlation on the pilot-data balance in multiple antenna systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06699S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248717,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew F.

UEC based schemes rely on an iterative decoding process, which involves three decoding blocks when concatenated with a turbo code. Owing to this, following the activation of one of the three blocks, the next block to be activated must be chosen from the other two decoding block options. Furthermore, the UEC decoder offers a number of decoding options, allowing its complexity and error correction capability to be dynamically adjusted. It has been shown that iterative decoding convergence can be expedited by activating the specific decoding option that offers the highest Mutual Information (MI) improvement to computational complexity ratio. This paper introduces an iterative demodulator, which is shown to improve the associated error correction performance, while reducing the overall iterative decoding complexity. The challenge is that the iterative demodulator has to forward its soft-information to the other two iterative decoding blocks, and hence the corresponding MI improvements cannot be compared on a like-for-like basis. Additionally, we also propose a method of eliminating the logarithmic calculations from the adaptive iterative decoding algorithm, hence further reducing its implementational complexity without impacting its error correcting performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248717/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15437886","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive iterative detection for expediting the convergence of a serially concatenated Unary Error Correction decoder, turbo decoder and an iterative demodulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive iterative detection for expediting the convergence of a serially concatenated Unary Error Correction decoder, turbo decoder and an iterative demodulator","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066417S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7248719,"authors":[{"name":"Feibai Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Feibai","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085745325"},{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402452900"},{"name":"Vincent K.

To exploit such sparse structure, we propose to use a receiver working at sampling rate much lower than Nyquist rate (sub-Nyquist sampling) to acquire the data corrupted by noise as well as multipath channel. With the sub-Nyquist rate samples, the joint channel estimation and data recovery is formulated as a sparse maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem which maximizes the associated non-concave likelihood function under the sparsity constraints on channel and data. This Sparse MLE framework is proved to provide solutions with bounded error w.r.t. the true value of channel and data under certain restricted isometry property (RIP) conditions. We propose an alternating sparse matching pursuit (ASMP) algorithm to solve the non-convex Sparse MLE problem. We also establish the sufficient conditions for ASMP to converge to solution with bounded error under certain restricted isometry property (RIP) conditions. Simulations show that when sparse structure is exploited, a low rate sub-Nyquist receiver using ASMP performs nearly as well as a Nyquist rate receiver.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248719.pdf","endPage":"2619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and data recovery of communication systems with sub-Nyquist receiver","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248719","startPage":"2614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and data recovery of communication systems with sub-Nyquist receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248719/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438179","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248719/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and data recovery of communication systems with sub-Nyquist receiver","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063206S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248726,"authors":[{"name":"Yohannes Jote Tolossa","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Sciences Jacobs University Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yohannes Jote","lastName":"Tolossa","id":"37085632597"},{"name":"Giuseppe Abreu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Sciences Jacobs University Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Abreu","id":"37298699700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248726","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness","Probabilistic logic","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","optimisation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic based TX-beamformer design","partial CSIT","optimized SINR estimation","CoMP","relaxation-restriction approach","SINR-constrained transmit-power minimization","CoMP algorithm","Bernstein-type inequality relaxation","robust SINR-constrained optimization problem","bisection method","quality-of-service constraints"]}],"abstract":"A long-standing problem in CoMP is that existing methods either require perfect and instantaneous CSIT which implies the need of excessive piloting and backhauling, so as to acquire and distribute CSIT accurately and timely. Thus, it is required to formulate a robust beamforming method to circumvent this drawbacks and has been the focus of many research papers recently. In this paper, a solution to the problem, which follows a relaxation-restriction (RAR) approach and emerges from the observation that the crux of the robustness problem is the construction of the SINR estimates themselves, subject to partial CSIT. Specifically, it is shown considering SINR-constrained transmit-power minimization that CoMP algorithms built using the biased estimator significantly outperform the best recent alternative method, namely the outage based probabilistic approach with Bernstein-type inequality relaxation of [1]. Our proposed alternative is also less relaxed as compared to existing literature. The level of conservatism can be further reduced through incorporating bisection method on top of the robust SINR-constrained optimization problem so that the required outage probability in this case is satisfied as per the user requirement and transmit power efficient solutions is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248726","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248726","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"2656","endPage":"2661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic based TX-beamformer design under partial CSIT using optimized SINR estimate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic based TX-beamformer design under partial CSIT using optimized SINR estimate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248726/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437879","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic based TX-beamformer design under partial CSIT using optimized SINR estimate","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098132S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248728,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Sun","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, P.R., China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085343080"},{"name":"Shuangfeng Han","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, P.R., China"],"firstName":"Shuangfeng","lastName":"Han","id":"37085347882"},{"name":"I.

The CSDMA scheme differentiates signals from different users by requiring each user to circularly shift their respective signals by a unique number of time domain samples. At the transmitter, each modulated data symbol is spread onto a subset of orthogonal subcarriers in the frequency domain, and the signals are then circularly shifted in the time domain. At the receiver, the received signals are oversampled in the time domain and then converted into the frequency domain for processing. The combination of circularly shifting at the transmitter and oversampling at the receiver ensures full multipath diversity, and it results in a special signal structure that allows the receiver to extract the signals from different users with zero or a small amount of multiple access interference (MAI). Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed oversampled CSDMA scheme can achieve significant performance gains over conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) with the same spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248732","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2697","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248732.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circular-shift division multiple access with oversampling receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Circular-shift division multiple access with oversampling receivers","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248732/","accessionNumber":"15437497","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248732/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circular-shift division multiple access with oversampling receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076134S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248733,"authors":[{"name":"Babar Aziz","affiliation":["IFSTTAR, LEOST, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France","Universite Lille Nord de France, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Babar","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37712505900"},{"name":"Fouzia Elbahhar","affiliation":["IFSTTAR, LEOST, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France","Universite Lille Nord de France, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Fouzia","lastName":"Elbahhar","id":"37294428900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248733","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Fading","Frequency synchronization","Time-frequency analysis","Interference","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intercarrier interference","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization errors","bit error rate","BER","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wideband systems","BPSK MB-OFDM UWB systems","Nakagami-m fading channels","OFDM based systems","carrier frequency offsets","CFO","intercarrier interference","Matlab simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Carrier frequency offset","Intercarrier interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the BER performance of Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Ultra Wideband (MB-OFDM UWB) systems with frequency synchronization errors.

Device diversity (DD) which leads to Received Signal Strength (RSS) value difference between the users' device and the reference device is becoming an increasingly important factor impacting the positioning accuracy. Thus, the device diversity is a key problem gained more and more attention in fingerprinting location system recently, which introduces many uncertainties to the positioning result. Traditionally, the Euclidean distance is widely adopted in fingerprinting method. However, when encountering with RSS value difference caused by device diversity, the localization performance is degraded significantly. Due to this problem, our paper proposes a method employing cosine similarity instead of the Euclidean distance to improve the positioning accuracy about 13.15% higher within 2 meters when device diversity exists in the positioning. The experiment results show that the proposed method presents a good performance without the expenses of computation caused by calibration method which is employed in many previous works.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248735.pdf","startPage":"2710","endPage":"2714","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cosine similarity based fingerprinting algorithm in WLAN indoor positioning against device diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Euclidean distance","Fingerprint recognition","Accuracy","Wireless LAN","Performance evaluation","Calibration","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","diversity reception","fingerprint identification","indoor navigation","radionavigation","RSSI","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cosine similarity","fingerprinting algorithm","device diversity","fingerprinting location method","WLAN indoor positioning system","received signal strength","RSS","fingerprinting location system","Euclidean distance","calibration method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device diversity","Euclidean distance","Cosine Similarity","Received signal strength","WLAN Positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cosine similarity based fingerprinting algorithm in WLAN indoor positioning against device diversity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248735/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438468","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cosine similarity based fingerprinting algorithm in WLAN indoor positioning against device diversity","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090802S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248737,"authors":[{"name":"George N.

Although the noncoherent OOK detector is usually operated as a simple single-symbol (one-shot) energy detector, it does not take into account memory that is induced by the channel. Hence, optimal noncoherent detection of OOK takes the form of sequence detection and has exponential complexity in the sequence length when implemented through an exhaustive search among all possible sequences. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that performs generalized-likelihood-ratio-test (GLRT) optimal noncoherent sequence detection of OOK signals in flat fading with cubic (in the sequence length) complexity. Moreover, for Rayleigh fading channels, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) noncoherent sequence detector. Due to its polynomial complexity, the proposed algorithm allows implementation of the optimal sequence detector for large sequence lengths, for which the conventional exhaustive-search approach becomes infeasible. Interestingly, with a large enough sequence length, the noncoherent detector attains nearly-coherent performance, although it does not utilize any knowledge about the propagation channel.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248737.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2726","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cubic-complexity optimal noncoherent OOK sequence detection in flat fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cubic-complexity optimal noncoherent OOK sequence detection in flat fading","htmlLink":"/document/7248737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cubic-complexity optimal noncoherent OOK sequence detection in flat fading","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570053869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107981S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248738,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085611377"},{"name":"Xiongbin Rao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiongbin","lastName":"Rao","id":"38247069600"},{"name":"Vincent K.N.

To achieve this goal, we first transform the problem of AUD and CE into standard CS problems.

The new technique takes advantage of regular mobile users' movement inside the environment to build the radio map. During these movements mobile users can measure and record received signal strength (RSS) from available wireless access points. The radio map will be adapted to environment changes using the recent collected RSSs data. The proposed algorithm does not use extra hardware (e.g., accelerometer, magnetometer) to exploit the collected RSSs.

However, when transmit power is constrained as a constant, the SNR under LOS scenario is larger than that under NLOS scenario benefiting from the strong LOS ray. Spatial correlation and SNR are two contradictory factors which both impact the performance of SM systems. In order to analyze performances of SM systems with a constant power under LOS and NLOS indoor scenarios, 15150 complex MIMO channel matrices are measured in a typical building of Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology. Based on measured data and motivated by the Minimum Distance Lower Bound (MDLB) approach, Euclid distances between received symbols of SM systems, as a monotonic function of ABEP, is analyzed. It is found that the effect of the SNR is much more important than the spatial correlation in the indoor environment so that SM system under LOS scenario shows a better performance than NLOS when the transmitting power is a constant. Furthermore, it is observed that bottlenecks of ABEP under LOS and NLOS scenarios are different. Under the LOS scenario, the bottleneck of ABEP is the antenna index error. On the contrary, under the NLOS scenario, the bottleneck of ABEP is the joint error. Using two extreme cases, such phenomena is analytically explained in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248742","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248742.pdf","startPage":"2750","endPage":"2755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of spatial modulation with constant transmitted power under LOS and NLOS scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248742/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of spatial modulation with constant transmitted power under LOS and NLOS scenarios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437884","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248742/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of spatial modulation with constant transmitted power under LOS and NLOS scenarios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083139S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248745,"authors":[{"name":"Peiyao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peiyao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085741440"},{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian","id":"38244081400"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.","Faculty of Engineering, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248745","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248745","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the low density parity check (LDPC) coded multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with iterative detection and decoding (IDD).

Combining uplink signals received by the different BSs by employing iterative frequency-domain algorithms allows for the correct separation of the signals transmitted by each MT. To transmit those signals, MTs rely on single-carrier (SC) modulation with frequency-domain equalization (FDE). Those SC-FDE transmissions combined with iterative block decision feedback equalization (IB-DFE) techniques have been shown to be a effective mean to transmit cyclic-prefix (CP) assisted blocks within broadband wireless systems. In this paper, we aim to combine the aforementioned concepts of uplink transmission based on IB-DFE with BS cooperation in a clever manner. Our proposed scheme improves both the frequency reuse factor and the MTs' performance at cell edges, with further improved performance when low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and turbo IB-DFE equalization schemes are considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248748/","accessionNumber":"15437880","displayDocTitle":"Towards an enhanced frequency reuse: Base station cooperation with turbo frequency domain receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards an enhanced frequency reuse: Base station cooperation with turbo frequency domain receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067007S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7248749,"authors":[{"name":"Roya Arab Loodaricheh","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Roya","lastName":"Arab Loodaricheh","id":"37085353729"},{"name":"Shankhanaad Mallick","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Shankhanaad","lastName":"Mallick","id":"38489619300"},{"name":"Vijay K.

We develop resource allocation schemes to minimize the dissatisfaction of the users through goal programming approach. First, we develop an offline scheme assuming that complete information about the harvested energy and channel state information (CSI) is available. The optimization problem is formulated as convex and efficient solution is provided based on dual decomposition algorithm. Next, we devise an online scheme considering the availability of causal and incomplete information about the harvested energy and CSI.

We also showed that the associated BSs are essentially no longer a PPP such that modeling them as a PPP to facilitate the analysis of interference-related performance metrics may detach from reality if the BS intensity is not significantly large if compared with the user intensity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248753","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248753.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random cell association and void probability in poisson-distributed cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random cell association and void probability in poisson-distributed cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248753/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438006","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248753/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random cell association and void probability in poisson-distributed cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050529S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7248754,"authors":[{"name":"SaiDhiraj Amuru","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech"],"firstName":"SaiDhiraj","lastName":"Amuru","id":"38548298900"},{"name":"Cem Tekin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA"],"firstName":"Cem","lastName":"Tekin","id":"38265507300"},{"name":"Mihaela van der Schaar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"van der Schaar","id":"37285114700"},{"name":"R.

In this paper, we answer this question in the positive, by developing a cognitive jammer that disrupts the communication between a victim transmitter-receiver pair. We formalize the problem using a novel multi-armed bandit framework where the jammer can choose various physical layer parameters such as signaling scheme, power level and the on-off/pulsing duration in an attempt to obtain power efficient jamming strategies. We first present novel online learning algorithms to maximize the jamming efficacy against static transmitter-receiver pairs i.e., the case when the victim does not change its communication technique despite the presence of interference. We prove that our learning algorithm converges to the optimal jamming strategy. Even more importantly, we prove that the rate of convergence to the optimal jamming strategy is sub-linear, i.e. the learning is fast, which is important in dynamically changing wireless environments. Also, we characterize the performance of the proposed bandit-based learning algorithm against adaptive transmitter-receiver pairs.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248754","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248754.pdf","startPage":"2822","endPage":"2827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systematic learning method for optimal jamming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A systematic learning method for optimal jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248754/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438325","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic learning method for optimal jamming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102838S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7248755,"authors":[{"name":"Rongrong Qian","affiliation":["Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Qian","id":"37399014800"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Switches","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive arrays","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","beam steering","directive antennas","femtocellular radio","indoor radio","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercell interference mitigation","femtocell network downlink","single radio parasitic antenna","indoor coverage improvement","system capacity improvement","electronically steerable parasitic array radiator antenna","ESPAR antenna","femtocell base station","user terminal","single radio frequency chain","wireless terminal","switched-beam array directional beam pattern","beampattern steering design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","ESPAR","beam switching","adaptive beamforming"]}],"abstract":"The femtocell networks provide a promising solution to increase system capacity and improve indoor coverage. However, inter-cell interference becomes enormous in femtocells due to dense deployment and cell-size reduction. This paper proposes the interference mitigation method for the downlink of femtocells, using the electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna at both femto-base stations (FBSs) and user terminals (UTs), which relies on a single radio-frequency (RF) chain; thus meets the demanding low-power, low-cost and small-size requirements of modern wireless terminals - FBSs and UTs. We first exploit the ESPAR antenna as a switched-beam array capable of predefining directional beampatterns accessing to different angular sectors. Then each FBS/UT dynamically selects an appropriate beampattern according to its measurement of desired direction. We also consider an optimal way to employ the ESPAR antenna by adaptively designing the beampattern steering to desired direction while placing nulls to interferers. The results show significant gains obtained by using ESPPAR antennas at both FBSs and UTs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation in femtocell networks using single-radio parasitic antennas","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248755","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248755.pdf","startPage":"2828","endPage":"2833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation in femtocell networks using single-radio parasitic antennas","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248755/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438360","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation in femtocell networks using single-radio parasitic antennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093254S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248756,"authors":[{"name":"Meisam Mirahsan","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Meisam","lastName":"Mirahsan","id":"37085591722"},{"name":"Rainer Schoenen","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Schoenen","id":"37442832700"},{"name":"Sebastian S.

User locations in cellular networks are often modeled as homogeneous (uniform) Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, the real user distributions are seldom purely homogeneous. Network users are usually concentrated at social attractors such as residential and office buildings, shopping malls, and bus stations. Wireless spectral efficiency depends significantly on the users' spatial heterogeneity, and thus relevant spatial traffic generators and models are important. In future (5G) networks, for which device-to-device (D2D), millimeter-wave (mmWave), and small-cell deployments in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), are promising technologies, it will become more important to have spatial traffic models which can represent the broad possibilities from completely homogeneous cases (e.g., a deterministic lattice) to extremely heterogeneous cases (e.g., highly clustered scenarios). In this paper, we study the spatial traffic heterogeneity of outdoor users in the denser areas of the city center of Paris, France. The building shape data is freely available from the OpenStreetMaps project. We measure the heterogeneity via a second-order statistic: the Coefficient of Variation (CoV) of two spatial metrics of the resulting point process: the Voronoi cell areas and the Delaunay cell edge lengths. The expected value of the CoV of these metrics allows us to study how the heterogeneity increases with the density of users. Moreover, we find that the statistical distribution of both these metrics is close to Weibull. Our results illustrate that the topology of the buildings in the city imposes a significant degree of heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of the wireless traffic.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248756","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248756.pdf","startPage":"2834","endPage":"2838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the spatial heterogeneity of outdoor users in wireless cellular networks based on open urban maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248756/","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the spatial heterogeneity of outdoor users in wireless cellular networks based on open urban maps","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438219","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248756/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the spatial heterogeneity of outdoor users in wireless cellular networks based on open urban maps","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100508S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248758,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37709690700"},{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China","Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085338056"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Chen Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37557551900"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248758","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Algorithm design and analysis","Interference","Channel estimation","Contamination","Training","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","estimation theory","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot reuse design","dense small cell networks","SCN","channel training","maximum ratio combining","MRC","data detection","channel state information","CSI","ergodic rate","pilot reuse factors","estimation error criterion","pilot contamination"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the uplink of a dense small cell network (SCN) using pilot reuse in channel training and maximum ratio combining (MRC) for data detection.

In the case of dense small cells networks, the standard single slope path-loss model has been shown to provide interesting, but supposedly too optimistic, properties such as the invariance of the outage/coverage probability and of the spectral efficiency to the base station density. This paper seeks to explore the performance of dense small cells networks when a more accurate path-loss model is taken into account. We first propose a stochastic geometry based framework for small cell networks where the signal propagation accounts for both the Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) components, such as the model provided by the 3GPP for evaluation of pico-cells in Heterogeneous Networks. We then study the performance of these networks and we show the dependency of some metrics such as the outage/coverage probability, the spectral efficiency and Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE) on the base station density and on the LOS likelihood of the propagation environment. Specifically, we show that, with LOS/NLOS propagation, dense networks still achieve large ASE gain but, at the same time, suffer from high outage probability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

Compared to the other complementary codes, I/Q column-wise complementary (IQCC) codes can support much more users with a given flock size, and at the same time it can still maintain perfect correlation properties via quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) spreading scheme. In this paper, we analyze the downlink bit error rate (BER) performance of an IQCC-based CDMA communication system. Utilizing the derived BER expression, we demonstrate the multiple access and multi-path interferences resistant performance of the system under both flat and frequency-selective fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248765","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2888","endPage":"2893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On performance of I/Q column-wise complementary coded CDMA communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On performance of I/Q column-wise complementary coded CDMA communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438214","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On performance of I/Q column-wise complementary coded CDMA communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080092S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248768,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Douik","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Douik","id":"37085434378"},{"name":"Hayssam Dahrouj","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA"],"firstName":"Hayssam","lastName":"Dahrouj"},{"name":"Tareq Y.

Consider the downlink of a cloud-radio access network (CRAN), where the cloud is only responsible for the scheduling policy and the synchronization of the transmit frames across the connected base-stations (BS). The transmitted frame of every BS consists of several time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZ), maintained at fixed transmit power. The paper considers the problem of scheduling users to PZs and BSs in a coordinated fashion across the network, by maximizing a network-wide utility under the practical constraint that each user cannot be served by more than one base-station, but can be served by one or more power-zones within each base-station frame. The paper solves the problem using a graph theoretical approach by introducing the scheduling graph in which each vertex represents an association of users, PZs and BSs. The problem is formulated as a maximum weight clique, in which the weight of each vertex is the benefit of the association represented by that vertex. The paper further presents heuristic algorithms with low computational complexity. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed algorithms and suggest that the heuristics perform near optimal in low shadowing environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248768","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248768.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248768","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated scheduling for the downlink of cloud radio-access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated scheduling for the downlink of cloud radio-access networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248768/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248768/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437388","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated scheduling for the downlink of cloud radio-access networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053664S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248769,"authors":[{"name":"Huseyin Haci","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Haci","id":"38109046400"},{"name":"Huiling Zhu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Huiling","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37401249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248769","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":864},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Silicon carbide","Signal to noise ratio","Uplink","OFDM","Integrated circuits","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference suppression","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","asynchronous nonorthogonal multiple access","NOMA systems","small cell uplink scenario","synchronous communications","uplink transmission","NOMA users","interfering users"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel interference cancellation technique is proposed for asynchronous non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems and the performance is theoretically investigated in a small cell uplink scenario.

The proposed model considers air station (AS) and ground base station (BS) located at foci points of a virtual bounding ellipsoid corresponded from the delay of longest propagation path. The scattering region around the ground BS is thus designed based on this virtual bounding ellipsoid truncated by the ground plane and average rooftop level of the BS's surroundings. Closed-form expressions for joint and marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of angle of arrival (AoA) observed at both AS and BS in correspondence with both azimuth and elevation planes are derived. Impact of various physical channel parameters on the elevational and azimuthal angular dispersion is thoroughly observed; which is useful in designing advanced signal processing techniques for directional antennas employed in aeronautical communication links.

The objective is to maximize the sum throughput of active cellular users (CUs) and feasible D2D groups in a cell, while guaranteeing a certain level of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for both the CUs and D2D groups. We formulate the problem of power and channel allocations as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem where each D2D group can reuse the channel of at most one CU and each CU can share their resources with at most one D2D group. A maximum weight bipartite matching based scheme is developed to assign the optimal channel for each feasible D2D group to reuse. A heuristic algorithm is then proposed which has less complexity compared to the matching algorithm. The performance of both schemes is evaluated through simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic scheme outperforms other heuristic schemes in the literature and can achieve close-to-optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248773","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"2937","endPage":"2942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel and power allocation in underlay multicast device-to-device communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel and power allocation in underlay multicast device-to-device communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248773/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437737","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel and power allocation in underlay multicast device-to-device communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05156S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248775,"authors":[{"name":"Monowar Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Monowar","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37061348800"},{"name":"Ekram Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Ekram","lastName":"Hossain","id":"38514511000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248775","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Radio transmitters","Wireless communication","Receivers","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","D2D-enabled multitier cellular networks","auction approach","wireless network","macrocell","device-to-device communication","centralized radio resource allocation","interference management scheme","transmitter node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-tier cellular networks","device-to-device (D2D) communication","distributed resource allocation","auction method"]}],"abstract":"Future wireless networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous with the co-existence of macrocells and small cells and they will also provide support for device-to-device (D2D) communication. In such muti-tier heterogeneous systems, centralized radio resource allocation and interference management schemes will not be scalable. In this work, we propose an auction-based distributed solution to allocate radio resources in a muti-tier heterogeneous network.

The signaling issues (e.g., information exchange over control channels) for the proposed distributed solution is also discussed.

D2D communications consume low energy and enhance system capacity via proximity range transmissions, where multi-hop transmissions are needed for real-time content sharing. Aiming to solve the challenging problem for multi-hop D2D communication networks, existing works only consider physical domain information to create Long-range Links (LLs) to reduce the transmission delay of multi-hop. In contrast, in this paper, we propose social community aware LLs establishment strategy, which exploits the interplay between social network's features and physical domain constrains. We first formulate the LLs establishment strategy as a cost optimization problem, then propose an efficient optimal greedy algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which is suitable for scenarios of both single sink and distributed content sharing. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution decreases the average path length significantly compared with other state-of-the-art schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248777","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248777.pdf","startPage":"2961","endPage":"2966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social community aware long-range link establishment for multi-hop D2D communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Social community aware long-range link establishment for multi-hop D2D communication networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248777/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437551","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248777/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social community aware long-range link establishment for multi-hop D2D communication networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082144S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7248778,"authors":[{"name":"Taehoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Taehoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37071166900"},{"name":"Kab Seok Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kab Seok","lastName":"Ko","id":"38486827000"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248778","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Quality of service","Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Random variables","Machine-to-machine communications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","OFDM modulation","quality of service","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prioritized random access","machine-to-machine communications","OFDMA based systems","quality-of-service","machine nodes","access priority","transmission power level","collision probability","access delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine-to-Machine","random access","access priority","fixed-location","timing alignment"]}],"abstract":"In machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, machine nodes perform a random access (RA) to synchronize with the eNodeB in order to transmit their new packets.

In this paper, we propose a prioritized random access (PRA) scheme, which enables machine nodes to indicate their access priority during the access phase by differentiating their transmission power level.

In order to cope with the massive number of machines, there is a need for new techniques to coordinate the access and allocate the resources. Although the majority of the proposed solutions are focused on the adaptation of the traditional cellular networks to the M2M traffic patterns, novel approaches based on the direct communication among nearby devices may represent an effective way to avoid access congestion and cell overload. In this paper, we propose a new strategy inspired by the classical Trunked Radio Systems (TRS), exploiting the Device-to-Device (D2D) connectivity between cellular users and Machine-Type Devices (MTDs). The aggregation of the locally generated packets is performed by a user device, which aggregates the machine-type data, supplements it with its own data and transmits all of them to the Base Station. We observe a fundamental trade-off between latency and the transmit power needed to deliver the aggregate traffic, in a sense that lower latency requires increase in the transmit power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248779/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437596","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Aggregation and trunking of M2M traffic via D2D connections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregation and trunking of M2M traffic via D2D connections","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053749S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248783,"authors":[{"name":"Germ\u00e1n Corrales Madue\u00f1o","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Germ\u00e1n Corrales","lastName":"Madue\u00f1o","id":"38233571800"},{"name":"Nuno K.

The existing solutions take a reactive approach in dealing with massive arrivals, such as non-selective barring when a massive arrival event occurs, which implies that the devices cannot get individual reliability guarantees. In this paper we propose a proactive approach, based on a standard operation of the cellular access. The access procedure is divided into two phases, an estimation phase and a serving phase. In the estimation phase the number of arrivals is estimated and this information is used to tune the amount of resources allocated in the serving phase.

To overcome this shortcoming, we record user motions as well as WiFi signals without the active participation of the users to construct the fingerprint database, in place of the previous site survey. In this paper, we develop an indoor localization system called WicLoc, which is based on WiFi fingerprinting and crowdsourcing. We design a fingerprint model to form fingerprints of each location of interest after fingerprint collection. We propose a weighted KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm to assign different weights to APs and achieve room-level localization. To obtain the absolute coordinate of users, we design a novel MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling) algorithm called MDS-C (Multi-Dimensional Scaling with Calibrations) to calculate coordinates of interested locations in the corridor and rooms, where anchor points are used to calibrate absolute coordinates of users. Experimental results show that our system can achieve a competitive localization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art WiFi fingerprint-based methods while avoiding the labor-intensive site survey.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248785","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"3008","endPage":"3013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WicLoc: An indoor localization system based on WiFi fingerprints and crowdsourcing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WicLoc: An indoor localization system based on WiFi fingerprints and crowdsourcing","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248785/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437808","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WicLoc: An indoor localization system based on WiFi fingerprints and crowdsourcing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052308S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7248797,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Pantisano","affiliation":["European Commission, JRC - Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Pantisano","id":"37720197600"},{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["CWC - Centre for Wireless Communications, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bennis","id":"37299803500"},{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Huawei France R&D, Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Paris, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248797","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"abstract":"Caching multimedia files at the network edge has been identified as a key technology for enhancing users' quality-of-service (QoS), while reducing redundant transmissions over capacity-constrained backhauls. Nevertheless, in small cell networks, the efficiency of a caching policy depends on the ability of small base stations (SBSs) to anticipate the requests from the user equipments (UEs). In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering (CF) scheme for estimating the required backhaul usage at each SBS, by mining the cacheability of UEs' file requests. In the proposed approach, each SBS has a two-fold objective: update the bandwidth allocation based on the estimated backhaul utilization, and, given the current bandwidth availability, identify which UEs to service. We formulate the problem as a one-to many matching game between SBSs and UEs, and we propose a novel cache-aware user association algorithm that minimizes the backhaul usage at each SBS, subject to individual QoS requirements. Simulation results, based on real-world service request logs, have shown that the proposed CF-based solution can yield significant gains in terms of backhaul efficiency and cache hit-ratio, reaching up to 25%, with a maximum gap of 9% to an optimal cache-aware association technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248797.pdf","startPage":"3082","endPage":"3087","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Match to cache: Joint user association and backhaul allocation in cache-aware small cell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Interference","Wireless communication","Quality of service","Resource management","Bismuth","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","collaborative filtering","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint user association","backhaul allocation","cache-aware small cell networks","quality-of-service","redundant transmissions","capacity-constrained backhauls","caching policy","collaborative filtering scheme","bandwidth allocation","cache-aware user association algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Match to cache: Joint user association and backhaul allocation in cache-aware small cell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438309","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Match to cache: Joint user association and backhaul allocation in cache-aware small cell networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069854S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248799,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37858750000"},{"name":"Andres Kwasinski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248799","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Source coding","Video coding","Silicon","Standards","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","Markov processes","video coding","video streaming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive learning","scalable video transmission","HARQ","dynamic wireless channels","time-varying wireless channel","adaptive source coding control","scalable video coding schemes","video-layer-based hybrid automatic repeat request scheme","adaptive error protection allocation","joint source-channel resource allocation","constrained Markov decision process","MDP","R-learning-based on-line algorithm","Lagrangian approach"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of dynamic, real-time video transmission control over a time-varying wireless channel. The problem of adaptive source coding control is studied on the basis of scalable video coding schemes. A video-layer-based hybrid automatic repeat request scheme is adopted to achieve adaptive error protection allocation. The problem of joint source-channel resource allocation over a time-varying wireless channel is posed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). The goal of the proposed video streaming MDP is to minimize the average end-to-end frame distortion with the constraint on the average transmission time for each layer. In order to address the issue of unknown channel dynamics and inaccurate distortion model, the R-learning-based on-line algorithm is adopted for learning the transmission police. To handle the constrained MDP with the standard R-learning algorithm, the constrained MDP is converted into an unconstrained MDP through the Lagrangian approach. The efficiency and convergence of the proposed learning algorithm are demonstrated with the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248799","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248799.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"3094","endPage":"3099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive learning for scalable video transmission with HARQ over dynamic wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive learning for scalable video transmission with HARQ over dynamic wireless channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248799/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437836","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive learning for scalable video transmission with HARQ over dynamic wireless channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570044899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084986S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248802,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Communication Networks, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"38260710800"},{"name":"Phuong Nga Tran","affiliation":["Communication Networks, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Phuong Nga","lastName":"Tran","id":"37566139100"},{"name":"H\u00fcseyin Kerem T\u00fct\u00fcnc\u00fco\u011flu","affiliation":["Communication Networks, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"H\u00fcseyin Kerem","lastName":"T\u00fct\u00fcnc\u00fco\u011flu","id":"37085615460"},{"name":"Andreas Timm-Giel","affiliation":["Communication Networks, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Timm-Giel","id":"38264136600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248802","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Integrated circuits","Throughput","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Heuristic algorithms","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","optimisation","quality of experience","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE femtocell cluster","quality of experience","coordinated QoE-based resource allocation problem","transport network limitation","convex optimization problem","Lagrangian relaxation","allocated bandwidth","physical resource blocks","transport network capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE femtocell cluster","QoE","Radio Resource Allocation","Utility","Lagrangian relaxation","Subgradient projection method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the coordinated QoE-based resource allocation problem for downlink direction in a LTE femtocell cluster, considering the transport network limitation.

This approach provides an ideal resource allocation solution but it is not practical, because the allocated bandwidth in the model is assumed to be a real value, while in practice, only an integer amount of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) can be assigned to a user. However, it is considered as a benchmark for our new developed algorithms. Afterwards, we propose efficient heuristics, which can be applied in real LTE systems due to their low complexity. The performance of our algorithms is investigated and evaluated by simulations. The simulations show that the coordinated resource allocation scheme considering transport limitation results in a better average QoE compared the scheme that does not take into account the transport network capacity.

Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) techniques have been proposed for macro-cell networks to mitigate interference. However, these static schemes are not adaptive to meet the traffic demand changes from mobile users, and thus inefficient with respect to power consumption in many scenarios. This paper starts with the basic soft fractional frequency reuse (SFFR) framework and proposes a traffic demand orientated green power control scheme that can make power allocation by considering different traffic demands. Afterwards, this green concept is extended to heterogeneous network (HetNet) for the power control strategies in low-power nodes (LPNs). Numerical results show that our proposed schemes can achieve considerable improvement in terms of throughput and power consumption, as well as extra rewards of high flexibility and low complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438181","htmlLink":"/document/7248811/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Traffic aware power allocation and frequency reuse for green LTE-A heterogeneous networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic aware power allocation and frequency reuse for green LTE-A heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062267S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248815,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Meskar","affiliation":["McMaster University Michael G DeGroote School of Medicine, Hamilton, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Erfan","lastName":"Meskar"},{"name":"Terence D.

In computational offloading, users can reduce energy consumption by executing jobs on a remote cloud server, rather than locally. In order to execute a job in the cloud, a mobile user must upload the job over a base station channel which is shared by all of the uploading users. The jobs are subject to hard deadline constraints, and since the channel quality may be different for each user, this may restrict the users ability to reduce energy usage. The system is modelled as a competitive game where each user is interested in minimizing its own energy use. The game is subject to the real-time constraints imposed by job execution deadlines, user specific channel bit rates, and the competition over the shared communication channel. The paper shows that for known classes of parameters, a game where each user independently adjusts its offload decisions always has a pure Nash equilibrium, and a Gauss-Seidel-like method for determining this equilibrium is presented. Results are then presented which illustrate that the system always converges to a Nash equilibrium using Gauss-Seidel. Data is presented which show the number of Nash equilibria that are found, the number of iterations required, and the quality of the solutions obtained. In particular, we find that the solutions perform well compared to a lower bound on total energy performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248815","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248815.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"3192","endPage":"3197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient offloading for competing users on a shared communication channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient offloading for competing users on a shared communication channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248815/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437666","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248815/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient offloading for competing users on a shared communication channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06443S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248816,"authors":[{"name":"Animesh Yadav","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Animesh","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37544843000"},{"name":"Mathew Goonewardena","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Superieure (ETS), Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"Goonewardena","id":"38234439000"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"},{"name":"Halima Elbiaze","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Halima","lastName":"Elbiaze","id":"37266950100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248816","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel retransmission scheme for energy harvesting transmitter and receiver","abstract":"We consider a point-to-point wireless link with automatic repeat request (ARQ) based packet transmission where both the transmitter and receiver nodes are energy harvesting (EHNs). Transmitter EHN has access to low-grade channel state information (CSI) as it is implicitly obtained from ARQ feedback. Furthermore, signal processing tasks such as sampling and decoding at the receiver EHN can be interrupted if there is insufficient energy in the battery that cause loss of packet and wastage of harvested energy both at the transmitter and receiver EHNs. We propose selective sampling (SS) scheme where only part of the transmitted packet is sampled and stored depending on the receiver nodes stored energy. SS information (SSI) is then fed back to the transmitter. Packet decoding is not performed until full packet is constructed. Hence, we modify the conventional ARQ messages, i.e., ACK/NAK by adding few more bits to carry additional SSI as well. Another objective is to find the optimal power allocation policy to adapt to the low-grade CSI and SSI available at the transmitter such that harvested energy can be utilized efficiently especially at the receiver. Furthermore, using a decision-theoretic framework, we propose greedy power allocation scheme to evaluate the performance of the proposed retransmission scheme. In numerical examples, we illustrate that our proposed scheme has lower average packet transmission time and packet drop probability (PDP) compared to the equal power allocation and greedy power allocation with conventional retransmission scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248816","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"3198","endPage":"3203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248816.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","Resource management","Automatic repeat request","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","decoding","energy harvesting","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retransmission scheme","energy harvesting transmitter","energy harvesting receiver","point-to-point wireless link","automatic repeat request","ARQ","packet transmission","EHN","channel state information","CSI","signal processing","SSI","selective sampling information","packet decoding","ACK/NAK","greedy power allocation scheme","packet drop probability","PDP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel retransmission scheme for energy harvesting transmitter and receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248816/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248816/","accessionNumber":"15438167","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel retransmission scheme for energy harvesting transmitter and receiver","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06271S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248817,"authors":[{"name":"Thai Hoang Dinh","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Thai","lastName":"Hoang Dinh","id":"37088477580"},{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Nguyen Tai Hung","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Tai","lastName":"Hung","id":"37085749607"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248817","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Internet","Satellites","Markov processes","Convergence","Energy states","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balloons","channel allocation","energy harvesting","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","stochastic programming","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balloon network","signal transmission","base station","Internet service provider","ISP","Earth","energy harvesting","natural energy sources","network performance optimisation","stochastic optimization problem","Markov decision process","learning algorithm","simulation-based method","optimal energy allocation policy","wireless network","sky"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet in the sky","Google Loon Project","Markov decision process"]}],"abstract":"Google's Project Loon [1] was launched in 2013 with the aim of providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. In the Loon network, balloons travel around the Earth and bring access points to the users who cannot connect directly to the global wired Internet. The signals from the users will be transmitted through the balloon network to the base stations connected to the Internet service provider (ISP) on Earth. The process of transmitting and receiving data consume a certain amount of energy from the balloon, while the energy on balloons cannot be supplied by stable power source or by replacing batteries frequently. Instead, the balloons can harvest energy from natural energy sources, e.g., solar energy, or from radio frequency energy by equipping with appropriate circuits. However, such kinds of energy sources are often dynamic and thus how to use this energy efficiently is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we study the optimal energy allocation problem for the balloons such that network performance is optimized and the revenue for service providers is maximized. We first formulate the stochastic optimization problem as a Markov decision process and then apply a learning algorithm based on simulation-based method to obtain optimal policies for the balloons. Numerical results obtained by extensive simulations clearly show the efficiency and convergence of the proposed learning algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal energy allocation policy for wireless networks in the sky","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248817","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248817.pdf","startPage":"3204","endPage":"3209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal energy allocation policy for wireless networks in the sky","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248817/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437976","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal energy allocation policy for wireless networks in the sky","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570020237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056496S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248818,"authors":[{"name":"Longzhuang He","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Longzhuang","lastName":"He","id":"37085544850"},{"name":"Jintao Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085620213"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085614079"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["National Engineering Lab. for DTV(Beijing)","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37085525158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248818","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","MIMO","Modulation","Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation coding","prescalers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial modulation performance improvement","phase-only prescaling SM scheme","multiple input multiple output channel","MIMO channel","transmitted information encoding","minimum Euclidean distance","transmitted symbol phase rotation","iteration process","phase-only prescaling factor design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spatial modulation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","phase-only pre-scaling","constellation shaping"]}],"abstract":"Spatial modulation (SM) is a modulation scheme that exploits the spatial dimension of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels to encode the transmitted information.

We show that the power allocation of the SBS can affect both the sensing performance and the transmission capacity, and thus, we jointly consider the power allocation problem in the spectrum management process.

The power allocation of each user equipment (UE) is subject to its quality-of-service (QoS) requirement as a function of the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). The macro base station (MBS) offloads the macro UEs (MUEs) to the femto access points (FAPs) in order to improve the energy efficiency of the entire system since certain MUEs are closer to the FAP(s) than to the MBS. When multiple femtocells exist in the network, auction mechanism is appropriate to establish the hybrid access. Each FAP bids for serving extra MUEs while the MBS acts as the auctioneer. In order to reduce the overhead of the information exchange, we assume that the FAPs decide their bids independently of each other by maximizing their own utilities. After receiving the bids, the MBS searches the winner FAP(s) and optimizes the number of offloaded MUEs. The compensation fee based on the bid is paid by the MBS to the winner FAP(s) for serving the additional MUEs. Numerical results show that the lowest bidder wins the auction. The proposed auction for motivating the hybrid access in the two-tier macro-femtocell network results in a win-win solution since both utilities of the MBS and FAPs are maximized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auction based spectrum sharing for hybrid access in macro-femtocell networks under QoS requirements","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248839","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248839.pdf","startPage":"3335","endPage":"3340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Auction based spectrum sharing for hybrid access in macro-femtocell networks under QoS requirements","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248839/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction based spectrum sharing for hybrid access in macro-femtocell networks under QoS requirements","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079051S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248843,"authors":[{"name":"Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn","affiliation":["Inria/Ens, 23 av. d'Italie 75214 Paris, France"],"firstName":"Bartlomiej","lastName":"Blaszczyszyn"},{"name":"Anastasios Giovanidis","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Giovanidis"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248843","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":237,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Linear programming","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Mathematical model","Cache memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","content management","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal geographic caching","wireless cellular network","optimal geographic placement","Poisson point process","base station","signal-to-interference-and noise ratio","SINR","optimal randomized content placement policy","coverage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless cache","Poisson cellular network","SINR k-coverage","hit probability","content popularity","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248843","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248843.pdf","startPage":"3358","endPage":"3363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248843","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal geographic caching in cellular networks","abstract":"In this work we consider the problem of an optimal geographic placement of content in wireless cellular networks modelled by Poisson point processes.

In this work, we show that the activation policy should be jointly derived with the caching policy, that places popular content files at the base station caches. As a result content is fetched effectively closer to the mobile end-users and can be transported via energy-prudent links, while at the same time as many as possible of the base stations are powered off. We then formulate the energy-minimizing problem, which is NP-hard, and introduce a novel approximation framework for its efficient solution.

Yet it can only apply to cellular users within WiFi coverage. Recently, delayed WiFi offloading is proposed to exploit users' mobility to purposely travel to WiFi coverage for data offloading. Its successful implementation depends on users' willingness to delay ongoing cellular data services until entering WiFi coverage. This paper proposes an incentive mechanism to allow a network operator to optimally reward his users to participate in delayed WiFi offloading, so as to reduce the network congestion. We formulate the design problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game: in Stage I, the operator announces a uniform reward to users to delay their existing cellular services; and in Stage II, each user decides to join the delayed offloading or not, depending on the reward, the network congestion, and his estimation of waiting cost for WiFi connection. The operator and users may or may not know all users' mobility and waiting cost information; thus, we propose optimal reward mechanisms under various information availability scenarios. Interestingly, we show that the optimal reward does not always increase with the cellular traffic load, as the increased network congestion can also help motivate users to switch to WiFi networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Switches","Delays","Games","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","game theory","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive mechanism design","WiFi offloading","data traffic","cellular networks","network congestion","WiFi coverage","two-stage Stackelberg game"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248848","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248848.pdf","startPage":"3388","endPage":"3393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive mechanism design for delayed WiFi offloading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incentive mechanism design for delayed WiFi offloading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248848/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248848/","accessionNumber":"15438412","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive mechanism design for delayed WiFi offloading","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068971S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248858,"authors":[{"name":"Ahlam Ben Cheikh","affiliation":["LIP6/UPMC University of Paris 6, Paris, France","CRISTAL Lab., University of Manouba, Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ahlam","lastName":"Ben Cheikh","id":"37085712789"},{"name":"Mouna Ayari","affiliation":["LIP6/UPMC University of Paris 6, Paris, France","CRISTAL Lab., University of Manouba, Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mouna","lastName":"Ayari","id":"37862747000"},{"name":"Rami Langar","affiliation":["LIP6/UPMC University of Paris 6, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Langar","id":"37296463300"},{"name":"Guy Pujolle","affiliation":["LIP6/UPMC University of Paris 6, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Pujolle","id":"37277718200"},{"name":"Leila Azouz Saidane","affiliation":["CRISTAL Lab., University of Manouba, Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Leila Azouz","lastName":"Saidane","id":"37297089000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248858","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Mobile communication","Handover","Predictive models","Probability distribution","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","femtocellular radio","hidden Markov models","mobility management (mobile radio)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility prediction scheme","HMM","femtocell network","hidden Markov model","optimization problem","femtocell access point assignment strategy","FAP assignment strategy","wireless communication","mobile geographic position","handoff decision making","cellular modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","Handover","Handoff optimization","Mobility Prediction","Hidden Markov Model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new approach for optimizing the handoff decision in femtocell networks using Hidden Markov Model.

In this regard, millimeter wave (mmW) communication technologies have recently emerged as an attractive solution to realize the vision of a high-speed and reliable wireless small cell backhaul network (SCBN). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for managing the spectral resources of a heterogeneous SCBN that can exploit simultaneously mmW and conventional frequency bands via carrier aggregation. In particular, a new SCBN model is proposed in which small cell base stations (SCBSs) equipped with broadband fiber backhaul allocate their frequency resources to SCBSs with wireless backhaul, by using aggregated bands. One unique feature of the studied model is that it jointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during resource allocation. The problem is then formulated as a one-to-many matching game and a distributed algorithm is proposed to find a stable outcome of the game. The convergence of the algorithm is proven and the properties of the resulting matching are studied. Simulation results show that under the constraints of wireless backhauling, the proposed approach achieves substantial performance gains, reaching up to 30% compared to a conventional best-effort approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248860.pdf","startPage":"3460","endPage":"3465","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching theory for backhaul management in small cell networks with mmWave capabilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Quality of service","Propagation losses","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre waves","mobile communication","resource allocation","telecommunication network management","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matching theory","backhaul management","millimeter wave communication technologies","mmWave communication technologies","wireless small cell networks","SCN","reliable wireless small cell backhaul network","SCBN model","frequency bands","carrier aggregation","small cell base stations","SCBS","broadband fiber backhaul","wireless channel","resource allocation","distributed algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Matching theory for backhaul management in small cell networks with mmWave capabilities","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437930","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching theory for backhaul management in small cell networks with mmWave capabilities","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089919S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248870,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Peng Hui","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung"},{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248870","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Unicast","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Wireless communication","Optimization","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","MIMO communication","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","telecommunication scheduling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic multicast scheduling","unicast transmission","MIMO-OFDM system","content delivery","multicast transmission","IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network","WLAN","multicast precoding","multicast grouping","Lyapunov optimization technique","channel error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicast scheduling","Lyapunov optimization","multicast precoding","WLAN network"]}],"abstract":"We propose a opportunistic multicast scheduling scheme to exploit content reuse when there is asynchronicity in user requests. A unicast transmission setup is used for content delivery, while multicast transmission is employed opportunistically to reduce wireless resource usage. We then develop a multicast scheduling scheme for the downlink multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing system in IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN). At each time slot, the scheduler serves the users by either unicast or multicast transmission. Out-sequence data received by a user is stored in user's cache for future use. Multicast precoding and user selection for multicast grouping are also considered and compliance with the IEEE 802.11 WLAN transmission protocol. The scheduling scheme is based on the Lyapunov optimization technique, which aims to maximize system rate. The resulting scheme has low complexity and requires no prior statistical information on the channels and queues. Furthermore, in the absence of channel error, the proposed scheme restricts the worst case of frame dropping deadline, which is useful for delivering real-time traffic.

In this paper, we make an analysis on the week-long traffic generated by a large population of users in a city of China, and model traffic dependence along both space and time dimensions. The evaluation results suggest connections between spatio-temporal dependence of cellular traffic and the organization of human lives. Region differences are observed to impact traffic dependence to a great extent. Additionally, interactive knowledge between space and time enhances traffic prediction with a decrease in root-mean-square error of 2.8%~25.2%.

Simulation results not only show the accuracy of the presented analysis, but also demonstrate that the analysis based on saturated load assumption may underestimate the actual performance of the OFDMA-random-access system.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248882","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"3592","endPage":"3597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A delay analysis model for Multichannel Random Access in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A delay analysis model for Multichannel Random Access in OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248882/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437493","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248882/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A delay analysis model for Multichannel Random Access in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570045131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053357S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248900,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Wichita State University"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Song","id":"37407137900"},{"name":"Jiang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37279378300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248900","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directional antennas","Receivers","Array signal processing","Directive antennas","Transmitting antennas","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","directive antennas","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","secondary users","common available channel","SU transmitting pair","primary users","directional antennas","average channel rendezvous delay","successful channel rendezvous probability"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) networks, channel rendezvous is a significant operation for two secondary users (SUs) to find a common available channel and establish a link between them. Currently, all previous channel rendezvous designs make the same assumption to ensure that the channel rendezvous process is successful: there must exist at least one common available channel between the SU transmitting pair. However, this assumption is not always feasible. When the number of primary users (PUs) is large, there could be no common available channel between two SUs. This issue results in serious problems in successfully implementing channel rendezvous in CR networks. In this paper, a framework is proposed to tackle this issue by using directional antennas instead of traditionally used omni-directional antennas. Our proposed framework aims to ensure that the probability that the SU pair have at least one common available channel is larger than a pre-defined threshold. Meanwhile, given a channel rendezvous scheme, the average channel rendezvous delay is minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the scenario with omni-directional antennas in terms of the probability of successful channel rendezvous when the number of PUs is large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that utilizes directional antennas to enhance the channel rendezvous performance in CR networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248900","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248900.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248900","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"3702","endPage":"3707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing channel rendezvous in cognitive radio networks with directional antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing channel rendezvous in cognitive radio networks with directional antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248900/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438054","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing channel rendezvous in cognitive radio networks with directional antennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057364S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248901,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Wang","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Research Center, China Faculty of Business & Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085637880"},{"name":"Jia Yu","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Research Center, China Faculty of Business & Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085636924"},{"name":"Xiaodong Lin","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Research Center, China Faculty of Business & Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37289264200"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Research Center, China Faculty of Business & Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248901","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Analytical models","Markov processes","Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","gradient methods","Markov processes","quality of service","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primary network","underutilized spectrum resource","cognitive radio network","CRN","accessible spectrum resource","secondary user","QoS reliability","PRN","interactive process","continuous time Markov decision process","CTMDP","CRN utility function","gradient-based optimal network selection strategy","Markov performance potential"]}],"abstract":"With the development of secondary spectrum markets, it is anticipated that multiple Primary Networks (PRNs) who own underutilized spectrum resources will be incorporated into Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). In this scenario, CRNs will have a greatly enhanced choice of accessible spectrum resources to support large volumes of Secondary Users (SUs), and guarantee the QoS reliability. Network selection problem, i.e. choosing which PRN to access, is essential for CRNs in a multi-PRN environment. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still lack of a unified method to address the network selection problem. In this paper, we aim to present a uniform framework to investigate and evaluate network selection strategies for CRNs. First, we model the interactive process of SUs and PUs as a Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP), and abstract the network selection strategy into the set of decision variables with respect to system states in the CTMDP. Second, under the proposed framework, we discuss multiple existing strategies, such as random, greedy, and statistically-weighted. Third, to achieve a more effective method, we derive the performance gradient of CRNs' utility function with respect to the network selection strategy, and propose a gradient-based optimal network selection strategy by using the theory of Markov performance potential. At last, simulations are conducted to validate the correctness of the proposed analytical framework, and the effectiveness of the proposed network selection scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248901","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248901.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248901","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"3708","endPage":"3713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A uniform framework for network selection in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A uniform framework for network selection in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248901/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248901/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438155","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A uniform framework for network selection in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072069S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248905,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Ben Ghorbel","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mahdi Ben","lastName":"Ghorbel","id":"38196549000"},{"name":"Bassem Khalfi","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Orpegon, USA"],"firstName":"Bassem","lastName":"Khalfi","id":"37085352297"},{"name":"Bechir Hamdaoui","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Orpegon, USA"],"firstName":"Bechir","lastName":"Hamdaoui","id":"37282036600"},{"name":"Mohsen Guizani","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Guizani","id":"37273043000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248905","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Resource management","Throughput","Cost function","Wireless communication","Gain","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","power consumption","pricing","real-time systems","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio systems","dynamic power utility","dynamic power pricing scheme","optimal power allocation analysis","real time power pricing","power consumption","power pricing function","water-filling solution","low-complexity algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy consumption awareness","spectrum access efficiency","power pricing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248905","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248905","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"The focus of this paper is to investigate the fundamental limits of power allocation when taking into account a dynamic power pricing scheme.

In this paper, we address the wireless backhaul reliability problem which arises due to limited control on horizontal mobility of the balloon transceivers. Despite the possibility of moving the balloons vertically, their overall trajectories are greatly dependent on the stratospheric wind which directly affects the availability of the links. In this paper, we show that using a few unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as relays can drastically improve the reliability of the wireless backhaul networks. We investigate the optimal paths that UAVs must follow to maximize the network reliability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Wireless communication","Relays","Trajectory","Mobile communication","Transceivers","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicles","relays","wireless balloon networks","wireless backhaul reliability problem","horizontal mobility","balloon transceivers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248915","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248915","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248915.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248915","startPage":"3795","endPage":"3800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using unmanned aerial vehicles as relays in wireless balloon networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using unmanned aerial vehicles as relays in wireless balloon networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248915/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248915/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437579","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using unmanned aerial vehicles as relays in wireless balloon networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046041S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7248916,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyue Ji","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Southern California, CA"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Ji","id":"38580848200"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Shanmugam","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Shanmugam"},{"name":"Giuseppe Vettigli","affiliation":["EE Department, Universit\u00e1 di Napoli Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Vettigli"},{"name":"Jaime Llorca","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent, Bell labs, NJ"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Llorca","id":"37319664300"},{"name":"Antonia M.

However, the schemes that have been shown to achieve order-optimal performance require content items to be partitioned into a number of packets that grows exponentially with the number of users [1]. In this paper, we first extend the analysis of the order-optimal multiple-groupcast coded multicasting scheme in [2] to the case of heterogeneous cache sizes and demand distributions, providing an achievable scheme and an upper bound on the optimal performance when the number of packets goes to infinity. We then show that the scheme achieving this upper bound can very quickly loose its promising multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization. To overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm based on greedy local graph-coloring that, while keeping the same content packetization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain. Our results show that the achievable schemes proposed to date to quantify the fundamental limiting performance, must be properly designed for practical regimes of finite content packetization.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248916","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"3801","endPage":"3806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient multiple-groupcast coded multicasting scheme for finite fractional caching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient multiple-groupcast coded multicasting scheme for finite fractional caching","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248916/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437421","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient multiple-groupcast coded multicasting scheme for finite fractional caching","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061143S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7248917,"authors":[{"name":"Loris Marini","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Loris","lastName":"Marini","id":"38489457800"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085346801"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248917","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Delays","Learning automata","Games","Resource management","Libraries","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","greedy algorithms","learning automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized learning automata","distributed caching scheme","heterogeneous cellular networks","content placement","downloading latency","independent learning automata","faster-converging discrete generalist pursuit algorithm","conditional inaction","information exchange","greedy algorithm","game convergence speed","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel distributed caching scheme in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCN).

Then we develop a framework for a game of LA based on CIDGPA defining the information exchange between learners and the environment. Within this framework, we design a reward function that approaches the performance of a greedy algorithm and show that a smart partition of the search space can double the game convergence speed, thereby halving the overhead due to signalling. Simulations show that our scheme can approach the greedy algorithm with a very small performance gap while providing a much lower computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed caching based on decentralized learning automata","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248917","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248917.pdf","startPage":"3807","endPage":"3812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed caching based on decentralized learning automata","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248917/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438279","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed caching based on decentralized learning automata","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053693S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248927,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Japan, USA"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37085447655"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085335917"},{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Korea"],"firstName":"Dong In","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085462834"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248927","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Games","Resource management","MIMO","Steady-state","Switches","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","cellular radio","evolutionary computation","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","quality of service","resource allocation","stochastic games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive cell association","antenna allocation","5G massive MIMO networks","5G cellular networks","resource management","quality of service","QoS","access points","hierarchical evolutionary game framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell association","antenna allocation","evolutionary game"]}],"abstract":"Massive MIMO will be one of the technologies adopted in 5G cellular networks due to its ability to enhance transmission performance.

We analyze the competitive situations where users in different classes with different QoS (i.e., data rate) requirement can choose to associate with any cell rationally and independently. Likewise, access points can allocate their antennas to different users. The users and access points are self-interested to maximize their own benefits in terms of data rate and total revenue, respectively. We formulate a hierarchical evolutionary game framework which is composed of the games for cell association and antenna allocation.

In this paper, a reduced-spaced channel quantization and feedback scheme which exploits slow variation of the angle-of-departure (AoD) distribution is proposed. By perceiving the instantaneous spatial channel to be a linear combination of slowly varying subset of matrices, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme offers up to 62.5% dimensionality reduction with negligible throughput loss in 16-antenna FD-MIMO system. When used together with vector quantization, the proposed scheme offers substantial gain over that supported by 3GPP LTE.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248928","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248928.pdf","startPage":"3873","endPage":"3878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced space channel feedback for FD-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248928/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced space channel feedback for FD-MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437357","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248928/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced space channel feedback for FD-MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122245S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248929,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Taleb","affiliation":["Communications and Networking Department, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Taleb","id":"37265763700"},{"name":"Miloud Bagaa","affiliation":["Department of Theories and Computer Engineering, CERIST, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Miloud","lastName":"Bagaa","id":"37945137900"},{"name":"Adlen Ksentini","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Adlen","lastName":"Ksentini","id":"37284835700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248929","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1339},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248929","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Delays","Logic gates","Optimization","Games","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cloud computing","mobility management (mobile radio)","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud offerings","mobile network","mobile traffic","carrier cloud","virtual network functions","VNF","federated cloud","data anchor gateways","sessions mobility","mobility features","service usage behavioral patterns","mobile users","mobile operators cost","VNI","virtual 5G network infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"Cloud offerings represent a promising solution for mobile network operators to cope with the surging mobile traffic. The concept of carrier cloud has therefore emerged as an important topic of inquiry. For a successful carrier cloud, algorithms for optimal placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on federated cloud are of crucial importance. In this paper, we introduce different VNF placement algorithms for carrier cloud with two main design goals: i) minimizing path between users and their respective data anchor gateways and ii) optimizing their sessions' mobility. The two design goals effectively represent two conflicting objectives, that we deal with considering the mobility features and service usage behavioral patterns of mobile users, in addition to the mobile operators' cost in terms of the total number of instantiated VNFs to build a Virtual Network Infrastructure (VNI).

In OFDMA networks, the full-duplex transmission makes the resource allocation problem more challenging, in particular when user devices are not full-duplex capable. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of subcarrier assignment and power allocation to maximize the sum-rate performance in full-duplex OFDMA networks. To achieve high throughput in the considered network, we propose to use a practical subcarrier assignment condition which allows a subcarrier to be allocated to a pair of uplink and downlink nodes when its inter-node channel gain is lower than its uplink channel gain. Considering this condition and the inter-node interference, we design three resource allocation algorithms which run for; i) uplink first, ii) downlink first, and iii) uplink and downlink in pair.

In this paper, cluster formation for downlink transmissions in C-RANs is studied. In particular, with a fixed intro-cluster cooperation strategy, an explicit expression for the successful access probability is derived by applying stochastic geometry. By using the obtained theoretical result as a utility function, the problem of grouping remote radio heads is formulated as a coalitional formation game, and then two distributed algorithms based on the merge and split approach are obtained as efficient solutions for the cases with and without cluster size constraints, respectively. Compared with grand cluster formation, which is a centralized method, simulation results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance with smaller cluster settings.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248933.pdf","startPage":"3903","endPage":"3908","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster formation in cloud-radio access networks: Performance analysis and algorithms design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Simulation","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","radio access networks","stochastic games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster formation","cloud-radio access networks","downlink transmissions","fixed intro-cluster cooperation","explicit expression","access probability","stochastic geometry","utility function","remote radio heads","coalitional formation game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cluster formation in cloud-radio access networks: Performance analysis and algorithms design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438185","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster formation in cloud-radio access networks: Performance analysis and algorithms design","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056043S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248934,"authors":[{"name":"Ruilong Deng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ruilong","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085461564"},{"name":"Rongxing Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rongxing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37309741500"},{"name":"Chengzhe Lai","affiliation":["National Engineering Lab. for Wireless Security, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xian, China","State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengzhe","lastName":"Lai","id":"37085644080"},{"name":"Tom H.

The fog is not a substitute but a powerful complement to the cloud. It is worthy of studying the interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core (cloud). To address this issue, we study the tradeoff between power consumption and delay in a cloud-fog computing system. Specifically, we first mathematically formulate the workload allocation problem. After that, we develop an approximate solution to decompose the primal problem into three subproblems of corresponding subsystems, which can be independently solved. Finally, based on extensive simulations and numerical results, we show that by sacrificing modest computation resources to save communication bandwidth and reduce transmission latency, fog computing can significantly improve the performance of cloud computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards power consumption-delay tradeoff by workload allocation in cloud-fog computing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248934","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248934.pdf","startPage":"3909","endPage":"3914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards power consumption-delay tradeoff by workload allocation in cloud-fog computing","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248934/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438076","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards power consumption-delay tradeoff by workload allocation in cloud-fog computing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071206S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248935,"authors":[{"name":"Chengchao Liang","affiliation":["Depart. of Systems and Computer Eng, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Chengchao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085452637"},{"name":"F.

Unfortunately, existing cellular networks adopting closed-loop communications impose too large spectrum overheads, which lead to an unacceptably low spectrum efficiency and unaffordable traffic burdens. To support the extremely challenging and unavoidable massive data exchanges in 2020 and beyond, we fundamentally re-consider an efficient scheme of the fully packet-switching radio access, that is, open-loop communications. To eliminate the concerns on the capabilities of enhancing the spectrum efficiency and reliability to support multimedia transmissions via open-loop communications, in this paper, we develop the optimum transmission repetition scheme to maximize the resource utilization while providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Our results confirm the efficiency, effectiveness, and practicability of the fully packet-switching radio access as compared with existing closed-loop communications, which suggest a revolutionary

control plane (CP) and data plane (DP) has been proposed for future cellular systems. It aims to overcome limitations of the conventional architecture by providing high data rate services under the umbrella of a coverage layer in a dual connection mode. This configuration could provide significant savings in signalling overhead. In particular, mobility robustness with minimal handover (HO) signalling is considered as one of the most promising benefits of this architecture. However, the DP mobility remains an issue that needs to be investigated. We consider predictive DP HO management as a solution that could minimise the out-of-band signalling related to the HO procedure. Thus we propose a mobility prediction scheme based on Markov Chains. The developed model predicts the user's trajectory in terms of a HO sequence in order to minimise the interruption time and the associated signalling when the HO is triggered. Depending on the prediction accuracy, numerical results show that the predictive HO management strategy could significantly reduce the signalling cost as compared with the conventional non-predictive mechanism.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248939.pdf","endPage":"3944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility prediction for handover management in cellular networks with control/data separation","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248939","startPage":"3939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mobility prediction for handover management in cellular networks with control/data separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248939/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438358","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248939/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility prediction for handover management in cellular networks with control/data separation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052163S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7248951,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we investigate the high-SNR capacity of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-output single-input (MISO) phase-noise channels for both the CLO and the SLO configurations. Our results show that the first-order term in the high-SNR capacity expansion is the same for all scenarios (SIMO/MISO and SLO/CLO), and equal to 0.5 ln(\u03c1), where \u03c1 stands for the SNR. On the contrary, the second-order term, which we refer to as phase-noise number, turns out to be scenario-dependent. For the SIMO case, the SLO configuration provides a diversity gain, resulting in a larger phase-noise number than for the CLO configuration. For the case of Wiener phase noise, a diversity gain of at least 0.5 ln(M) can be achieved, where M is the number of receive antennas. For the MISO, the CLO configuration yields a higher phase-noise number than the SLO configuration. This is because with the CLO configuration one can obtain a coherent-combining gain through maximum ratio transmission (a.k.a. conjugate beamforming). This gain is unattainable with the SLO configuration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248951","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248951.pdf","startPage":"4012","endPage":"4017","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-SNR capacity of multiple-antenna phase-noise channels with common/separate RF oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"High-SNR capacity of multiple-antenna phase-noise channels with common/separate RF oscillators","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437877","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248951/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-SNR capacity of multiple-antenna phase-noise channels with common/separate RF oscillators","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075518S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7248952,"authors":[{"name":"Metodi P.

Simulations show that for a given constellation size, a rate close to the Gaussian capacity can be achieved up to a certain SNR point, which can be found efficiently by optimizing the constellation for the equivalent orthogonal channel, obtained by the singular value decomposition. Furthermore, lower bounds on the constrained capacity are derived for the cases of square and tall MIMO matrix, by optimizing the constellation for the equivalent channel, obtained by QR decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248952","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248952.pdf","startPage":"4018","endPage":"4023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating the constellation constrained capacity of the MIMO channel with discrete input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248952/","displayDocTitle":"Approximating the constellation constrained capacity of the MIMO channel with discrete input","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248952/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating the constellation constrained capacity of the MIMO channel with discrete input","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570028527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089848S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248954,"authors":[{"name":"Borzoo Rassouli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Communication and Signal Processing Group, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Borzoo","lastName":"Rassouli","id":"38246675100"},{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Communication and Signal Processing Group, London, United Kingdom","School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Korea"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Clerckx","id":"37269077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248954","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Gaussian distribution","MIMO communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output identity channel capacity","MIMO identity channel capacity","optimal input probability density function","identity theorem","holomorphic functions","spherical coordinates","capacity-achieving distribution","hyper-spheres","massive MIMO","constant amplitude signaling","discrete-time memoryless Gaussian channel","average power constrained capacity","Gaussian input distribution","discrete finite set"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) identity channel under the peak and average power constraints is investigated. The approach of Shamai et al. is generalized to the higher dimension settings to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal input probability density function. This approach prevents the usage of the identity theorem of the holomorphic functions of several complex variables which seems to fail in the multi-dimensional scenarios. It is proved that in the spherical coordinates, the magnitude and phases of the capacity-achieving distribution are mutually independent and its support is a finite set of hyper-spheres where the points are uniformly distributed on them. Subsequently, it is shown that when the average power constraint is relaxed, if the number of antennas is large enough (e.g. massive MIMO), the capacity has a closed form solution and constant amplitude signaling at the peak power achieves it. Finally, it will be observed that in a discrete-time memoryless Gaussian channel, the average power constrained capacity, which results from a Gaussian input distribution, can be closely obtained by an input where the support of its magnitude is a discrete finite set.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248954","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248954.pdf","startPage":"4030","endPage":"4035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of vector Gaussian channels with bounded inputs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248954/","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of vector Gaussian channels with bounded inputs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437911","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248954/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of vector Gaussian channels with bounded inputs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053587S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248957,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085593750"},{"name":"Md.

A classical-quantum communication system is presented, which relies on error-correction in the classical domain to achieve an information rate that approaches the entanglement-assisted capacity of the quantum channel. Classical information is transmitted over the channel by means of the superdense coding protocol, and the impact of the noisy distribution of initial entanglement resources on the achievable information rate is considered. In this context, the transmission model is equivalent to a non-binary discrete symmetric classical channel, which motivates the use of non-binary error-correcting codes capable of exploiting correlations between the pairs of classical bits communicated via the superdense coding protocol. We illustrate this principle by showing that duo-binary turbo codes significantly outperform binary turbo codes in the considered scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248959","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248959.pdf","startPage":"4060","endPage":"4065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary classical error-correcting codes for quantum communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary classical error-correcting codes for quantum communication","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248959/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438090","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary classical error-correcting codes for quantum communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069447S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248961,"authors":[{"name":"Liyuan Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liyuan","lastName":"Song","id":"37085701958"},{"name":"Mu Zhang","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Zulin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zulin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404933700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248961","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Decoding","Memory management","Iterative decoding","Computational complexity","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","parity check codes","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["majority-logic decoding","non-binary LDPC codes","reliability update","Tanner graph","computational complexity","memory consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-binary LDPC codes","majority-logic decoding","bit-reliability","error-floor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248961","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248961.pdf","startPage":"4072","endPage":"4076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248961","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low error-floor majority-logic decoding based algorithm for non-binary LDPC codes","abstract":"The traditional majority-logic decoding (MLgD) based algorithms suffer error-floors for decoding non-binary LDPC codes with small column weights.

For such a network, we derive new expressions for the capacity of a given user with independent Rayleigh fading and arbitrary path loss between the users and all the antennas at the base stations. Our capacity expression is based on accurate approximations we derive for the characteristic function and the probability density function of the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). Numerical examples demonstrate that our analytical solutions accurately approximate the exact capacity. Furthermore, we highlight that the distributed approach introduces less overhead to the network compared with global cooperation. We note that the performance gap is small when the network is lightly loaded.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Computational modeling","Antennas","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","cooperative communication","least mean squares methods","Rayleigh channels","signal processing","statistical distributions","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed LMMSE estimation","cooperative cellular network","multiple antenna base station cooperative cluster","signal processing","distributed processing architecture","user symbol local LMMSE estimation","Rayleigh fading loss","arbitrary path loss","probability density function","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base station cooperation","Capacity","Multiuser detection","LMMSE","Rayleigh fading"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248963","startPage":"4083","endPage":"4088","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248963.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed LMMSE estimation in cooperative cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed LMMSE estimation in cooperative cellular networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15437982","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7248963/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed LMMSE estimation in cooperative cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068531S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7248965,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Hu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085418467"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Xinqian Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinqian","lastName":"Xie","id":"38237096200"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085497446"},{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248965","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248965","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","Estimation","Fading","Correlation","Matrix decomposition","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","mean square error methods","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud radio access networks","segment training","channel estimation","training design","signal processing functions","centralized baseband unit","remote radio heads","received signals","channel state information","sequential minimum mean square error","MMSE","long-term channel correlation statistics","radio access links","eigenvalue decomposition"]}],"abstract":"Cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) have drawn considerable interests due to the significant improvements of spectral and energy efficiencies. Since most signal processing functions are moved to the centralized baseband unit (BBU), remote radio heads (RRHs) in C-RANs can be regarded as soft relays to transfer the received signals. The centralization characteristics in C-RANs make traditional channel estimation and training design approaches inefficient, and the requirements of perfect channel state information (CSI) would not be satisfied in turn. To solve this problem, a segment training based individual channel estimation scheme and the corresponding training design are proposed for C-RANs in this paper. Particularly, the channel estimator in terms of the sequential minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) is developed through a prior knowledge of long-term channel correlation statistics and previous channel estimates. The optimal training design for the developed estimator is derived by minimizing the estimation mean-square-error (MSE). Further, the optimal training design for the channel estimation of radio access links is computed by applying the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD). Numerical results show that performance gains of the proposed channel estimation and training design schemes are significant.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248965.pdf","startPage":"4095","endPage":"4100","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segment training based channel estimation and training design in cloud radio access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Segment training based channel estimation and training design in cloud radio access networks","htmlLink":"/document/7248965/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437463","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segment training based channel estimation and training design in cloud radio access networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077272S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248970,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It has been recently recognized that optimizing also the order in which uplink and downlink transmissions, or more generally the two directions of a two-way link, are scheduled can lead to significant benefits in terms of interference reduction. In this work, the optimization of bi-directional scheduling is investigated in conjunction with the design of linear precoding and equalization for a general multi-link MIMO two-way system. A simple algorithm is proposed that performs the joint optimization of the ordering of the transmissions in the two directions of the two-way links and of the linear transceivers, with the aim of minimizing the interference leakage power.

Remarkably, we show that the retrospective interference alignment can achieve the optimal sum-DoF in the context of two-cell two-user scenario by providing a new outer bound.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrospective interference alignment for two-cell uplink MIMO cellular networks with delayed CSIT","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248973","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248973.pdf","startPage":"4144","endPage":"4150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Retrospective interference alignment for two-cell uplink MIMO cellular networks with delayed CSIT","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248973/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437881","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrospective interference alignment for two-cell uplink MIMO cellular networks with delayed CSIT","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570029447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064654S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7248975,"authors":[{"name":"Pritam Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Pritam","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37533908900"},{"name":"Ravi Tandon","affiliation":["Discovery Analytics Center and Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Tandon","id":"38556954900"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7248975","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248975","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Encoding","Security","Joints","Transmitting antennas","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","encoding","radio transmitters","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO broadcast channel secrecy","channel state information","radio transmitter","two-user multiple-input single-output broadcast channel","confidential messages","secure degrees of freedom region","symmetry assumption","coding synergistic benefits"]}],"abstract":"The two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCCM) is studied in which the nature of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) from each user can be of the form I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n, i = 1, 2 where I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n; I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n \u2208 {P;D;N}, and the forms P, D and N correspond to perfect and instantaneous, completely delayed, and no CSIT, respectively.

Unlike conventional cooperative networks, the source and relay are assumed to have no embedded energy supplies in the considered system. Hence, they need to first harvest energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signals radiated by the AP in the downlink (DL) before information transmission in the uplink (UL). Inspired by the recently proposed harvest-then-transmit (HTT) and harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocols, we develop a new adaptive transmission (AT) protocol. In the proposed protocol, at the beginning of each transmission block, the AP charges the source. AP and source then perform channel estimation to acquire the channel state information (CSI) between them. Based on the CSI estimate, the AP adaptively chooses the source to perform UL information transmission either directly or cooperatively with the relay. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the average throughput of the proposed AT protocol over Nakagami-m fading channels. The analysis is then verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the proposed AT protocol considerably outperforms both the HTT and HTC protocols.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive transmission protocol for wireless-powered cooperative communications","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7248986","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07248986.pdf","startPage":"4223","endPage":"4228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7248986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7248986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7248986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive transmission protocol for wireless-powered cooperative communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7248986/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437842","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive transmission protocol for wireless-powered cooperative communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570046549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065793S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7248986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7248990,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Dabirnia","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Dabirnia","id":"37085618465"},{"name":"Tolga M.

For instance, an analytical closed-form expression of the Log-normal sum distribution does not exist and is still an open problem. A crude Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is of course an alternative approach. However, this technique is computationally expensive especially when dealing with rare events (i.e. events with very small probabilities). Importance Sampling (IS) is a method that improves the computational efficiency of MC simulations. In this paper, we develop an efficient IS method for the estimation of the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the sum of independent and not identically distributed Log-normal RVs. This technique is based on constructing a sampling distribution via twisting the hazard rate of the original probability measure. Our main result is that the estimation of the CCDF is asymptotically optimal using the proposed IS hazard rate twisting technique.

Assuming Gaussian transmission and Gaussian compress-and-forward relaying strategy for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel with a finite-capacity out-of-band relay-destination link and with arbitrarily correlated noises, this paper proposes a coordinate ascent approach for iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the source and the quantization noise covariance matrix at the relay. We show that the optimization of quantization noise covariance matrix under fixed input can be solved in closed form using a simultaneous diagonalization approach, while the optimization of transmit covariance matrix under fixed quantization can be cast as a convex optimization problem. This paper further introduces the concept of antenna pooling and illustrates the importance of accounting for the noise correlation across the user terminals due to common interference. We show that the optimized transmission and device-to-device relaying strategies that take advantage of the noise correlation can significantly improve the user throughput in a cellular environment by enabling interference rejection across the user terminals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249002.pdf","startPage":"4321","endPage":"4326","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized MIMO transmission and compression for interference mitigation with cooperative relay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optimization","Noise","Quantization (signal)","Interference","Covariance matrices","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","optimisation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized MIMO transmission","MIMO compression","interference mitigation","cooperative relay","device-to-device link","cooperative communication","signal enhancement","interference rejection","Gaussian transmission","Gaussian compress-and-forward relaying strategy","relay channel","finite-capacity out-of-band relay-destination link","coordinate ascent approach","transmit covariance matrix","quantization noise covariance matrix","convex optimization problem","antenna pooling","noise correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized MIMO transmission and compression for interference mitigation with cooperative relay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249002/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438351","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized MIMO transmission and compression for interference mitigation with cooperative relay","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051206S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249003,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanzhan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, P.

Several power-scaling schemes are proposed based on the maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) at the relay. When the number of the relay antennas tends to infinity, we derive and quantify the asymptotic spectral efficiency of the proposed power-scaling schemes. We show that the very large antenna array can significantly reduce the effect of loop interference because of the antenna array gain. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the loop interference can also be reduced by cutting down the transmission power, which is verified by the numerical results. The analytical and numerical results show that the proposed power-scaling schemes can achieve good performance tradeoffs between the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity of two-way massive MIMO full-duplex relay systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249003","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249003.pdf","startPage":"4327","endPage":"4332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On capacity of two-way massive MIMO full-duplex relay systems","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249003/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437654","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity of two-way massive MIMO full-duplex relay systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114271S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249004,"authors":[{"name":"Akbar M.

The D-MIMO transceiver architecture is particularly attractive in emerging high-frequency systems, such as millimeter-wave systems, in which the requirement of a phase-coherent local oscillator at the receiver can be challenging. A direct application of conventional linear interference suppression techniques is not possible with differential communication. Thus, we first develop a general model for D-MIMO systems, with a corresponding D-MIMO channel matrix, that forms the basis of the development in this paper. A surprising result is that a quasi-coherent version of the underlying channel matrix can also be estimated from the D-MIMO matrix, making conventional linear interference suppression possible as well.

Assuming perfect channel state information at the receivers, we study cellular and D2D spectral efficiency. In the asymptotic regime where the number of BS antennas goes to infinity, we find that the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of any cellular user increases unboundedly and the effects of noise, fast fading, and the interfering signals from the other co-channel cellular users and the infinite D2D transmitters vanish completely. In the non-asymptotic regime, we derive simple analytical lower bounds for both cellular and D2D spectral efficiency, which allow for efficient numerical evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249006","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249006.pdf","startPage":"4345","endPage":"4350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral efficiency of massive MIMO systems with D2D underlay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249006/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral efficiency of massive MIMO systems with D2D underlay","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438050","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249006/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral efficiency of massive MIMO systems with D2D underlay","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088035S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249009,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085696162"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291851800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249009","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Network coding","Downlink","Computer numerical control","Encoding","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","decode and forward communication","energy conservation","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","network coding","optimisation","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","decode-and-forward MIMO relay channel","DF MIMO relay downlink channels","two-way relay networks","energy efficiency","spectrum efficiency","multiantenna relay node","multiuser MIMO system","zero-forcing beamforming","ZFBF","channel states","channel matrices","SNR loss"]}],"abstract":"Network coding (NC) has been applied into two-way relay networks to achieve higher throughput and improve energy and spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the achievable rate region of two-way Decode-and-Forward (DF) MIMO relay downlink channels with multi-antenna relay node and users. To figure out the rate region of NC in multiuser MIMO system, a convex optimization solution is presented in this paper. The two schemes, Network Coding and Zero-Forcing BeamForming (ZFBF), are compared in terms of the achievable rate region with different channel states. When both of the two users know the messages destined for the other a priori, it is proved that NC is always the optimal compared with ZFBF. Meanwhile, ZFBF tends to achieve a larger rate region when the channel matrices of the two users approach to be orthogonal to each other. However, NC suffers from the maximum SNR loss in this special case. In particular, the extreme situation is studied to demonstrate the optimality of NC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimality of network coding in two-way Decode-and-Forward MIMO relay channel","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249009","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249009.pdf","startPage":"4363","endPage":"4367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the optimality of network coding in two-way Decode-and-Forward MIMO relay channel","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249009/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437747","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimality of network coding in two-way Decode-and-Forward MIMO relay channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048349S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249010,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Reza Heidarpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali Reza","lastName":"Heidarpour","id":"37085634503"},{"name":"Gunes Karabulut Kurt","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gunes Karabulut","lastName":"Kurt","id":"38191208100"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37278726600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249010","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Broadcasting","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity methods","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","multiplexing","network coding","OFDM modulation","probability","telecommunication network reliability","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","DMT analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","network coded cooperation","NCC-OFDMA system","throughput efficiency","cooperative wireless networks","time division multiple access","multiuser system","outage probability","frequency diversity","spatial diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coded cooperation (NCC)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)"]}],"abstract":"Network coded cooperation (NCC) is an effective method to improve the throughput efficiency in cooperative wireless networks.

We establish a general framework to derive achievable DoF based on linear signal processing. We show that, to achieve a certain DoF, a joint design of the user transmit beamforming, relay precoding, and user receive beamforming is required. We propose novel signal alignment techniques to reduce the number of linearly independent equations required for interference neutralization.

Seamless control with humans in the loop requires latencies on the order of a millisecond with very high reliabilities, paralleling the requirements for high-performance industrial control. Today's practical wireless systems cannot meet these reliability and latency requirements, forcing the use of wired systems. This paper introduces a wireless communication protocol, dubbed \u201cOccupy CoW,\u201d based on cooperative communication among nodes in the network to build the diversity necessary for the target reliability. Simultaneous retransmission by many relays achieves this without significantly decreasing throughput or increasing latency.

High mobility of wireless terminals causes large Doppler spread, which provides Doppler diversity. However, channel estimation errors are usually inevitable in such systems due to fast time-varying fading caused by large Doppler spread, and they will negatively impact system performance. We study the fundamental tradeoff between Doppler diversity and channel estimation errors by identifying the exact analytical expression of the maximum Doppler diversity order achievable in the presence of imperfect CSI. The analytical study is enabled by a simple repetition code at the transmitter and a new optimum diversity receiver, which is developed by analyzing the statistical properties of channel estimation errors. The analytical results show that if the energy of pilot symbols scales linearly with that of data symbols, then systems with imperfect CSI can achieve the same Doppler diversity order as those with perfect CSI. A non-linear scaling between the energy of pilot and data symbols always results in a loss of Doppler diversity for systems with imperfect CSI.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249020.pdf","startPage":"4431","endPage":"4436","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249020","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249020","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249020","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Channel estimation","Diversity reception","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","Doppler effect","fading channels","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio receivers","radio transmitters","statistical analysis","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless terminal high mobility system maximum doppler diversity","imperfect channel state information","imperfect CSI transmitter","large Doppler spread","channel estimation error","fast time-varying fading","maximum Doppler diversity order","optimum diversity receiver","statistical properties","pilot symbol","data symbol","nonlinear scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249020/","displayDocTitle":"On the maximum Doppler diversity of high mobility systems with imperfect channel state information","accessionNumber":"15437224","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249020/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the maximum Doppler diversity of high mobility systems with imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570042255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100789S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249023,"authors":[{"name":"Panos N.

We maximize the secure EE with the given maximum power and the minimum secrecy rate requirements. The difficulty of the problem comes from the nonconvexity of both the objective function and the secrecy rate constraint. Therefore, a suboptimal solution scheme, based on fractional programming, dual decomposition, and DC (difference of convex functions) programming, is addressed to solve this problem iteratively. The proposed solution scheme composed of three-layer iterations transforms the primal problem into easier subproblems at each iterative layer, such that the resulting subproblems can be solved by the corresponding optimization methods mentioned above. The simulation results demonstrate that the secure EE of the proposed scheme is superior than that obtained by the conventional schemes with a small decrease of the average secrecy rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Programming","Security","Linear programming","Physical layer","Minimization","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","convex programming","green computing","iterative methods","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure green communication","amplify-and-forward relaying channels","eavesdroppers","secure energy efficiency metric","minimum secrecy rate requirements","objective function","secrecy rate constraint","fractional programming","dual decomposition","DC programming","difference-of-convex functions programming","three-layer iterations","optimization methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249026","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249026.pdf","startPage":"4468","endPage":"4473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure green communication for amplify-and-forward relaying with eavesdroppers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure green communication for amplify-and-forward relaying with eavesdroppers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249026/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249026/","accessionNumber":"15437693","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure green communication for amplify-and-forward relaying with eavesdroppers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06032S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249027,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Feng","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085470250"},{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, P.

In this paper, we contribute to analyze the network capacity of the push-based converged network with limited user storage and then develop the corresponding optimal pushing schemes. Specifically, we first establish two operational regions for the converged network, namely, the push-limited region and the cache-limited region, to reveal the fundamental tradeoff between the broadcast pushing ability and the user caching capacity. The network capacity is then derived under the traditional popularity-based pushing scheme. Moreover, we investigate the optimal pushing scheme under two different criteria, i.e., to maximize either the offloading probability or the offloading data percent. The pushing optimization problem is modeled as the 0-1 knapsack problem, and can be easily solved by the greedy algorithm. Interestingly, the optimal scheme depends on not only the optimization objective, but also the region where the system operates. Finally, numerical results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the developed analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the push-based converged network with limited storage","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249027","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249027.pdf","startPage":"4474","endPage":"4479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the push-based converged network with limited storage","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249027/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438391","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the push-based converged network with limited storage","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086865S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249037,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085352809"},{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Eng. and Computer Science Queens University of Belfast Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Youngwook","lastName":"Ko","id":"37085432621"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249037","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a sparse signal modulation (SSM) method for precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and study the signal detection. Although a receiver is able to exploit a path diversity gain with random precoding in OFDM, the complexity of the receiver is usually high as the orthogonality is not retained due to precoding. However, with SSM, we can derive a low-complexity detector that can provide reasonably good performances with a low sparsity ratio based on the notion of compressive sensing (CS). An important feature of a CS detector is that it can estimate SSM signals with a small fraction of the received signals over sub-carriers. This feature can allow us to build a low cost receiver with a small number of demodulators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249037.pdf","startPage":"4536","endPage":"4540","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based detector for sparse signal modulation in precoded OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Receivers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","diversity reception","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing based detector","sparse signal modulation","precoded OFDM","precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","low-complexity detector","SSM signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse signal modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based detector for sparse signal modulation in precoded OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437985","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based detector for sparse signal modulation in precoded OFDM","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053717S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249038,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Garcia-Rodriguez","affiliation":["University College London (UCL), London, UK"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Garcia-Rodriguez","id":"37085430266"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["University College London (UCL), London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249038","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"abstract":"In this paper we propose a spatial modulation (SM) technique with improved energy efficiency (EE) for the multiple access channel (MAC) with a large number of antennas.

However, it is sensitive to the time selectivity caused by the high-mobility, which largely degrades the accurate of estimating the channel state information (CSI). Therefore, the channel estimation in high-mobility OFDM systems has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, numerous experimental studies have shown that high-mobility broadband wireless channels tend to have some inherent sparsity. In this paper, we introduce the compressed sensing (CS) to utilize the inherent channel sparsity and estimate the high-mobility channel. Based on the CS minimization criterion, we propose two off-line pilot design algorithms to improve the estimation performance. One is to design the pilot symbol only and the other is to jointly design the pilot symbol and the pilot pattern. Simulation results show that the proposed methods achieve better estimation performances than conventional linear methods in high-mobility environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249040","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249040.pdf","startPage":"4553","endPage":"4557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed channel estimation for high-mobility OFDM systems: Pilot symbol and pilot pattern design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249040/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed channel estimation for high-mobility OFDM systems: Pilot symbol and pilot pattern design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438097","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249040/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed channel estimation for high-mobility OFDM systems: Pilot symbol and pilot pattern design","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570044687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063458S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249041,"authors":[{"name":"Chenhao Qi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chenhao","lastName":"Qi","id":"37707041000"},{"name":"Yongming Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291620400"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Lenan Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lenan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085617856"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249041","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Antennas","Joints","MIMO","Matching pursuit algorithms","Downlink","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","MIMO communication","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse channel estimation","compressed sensing","massive MIMO systems","wireless channels","MIMO channels","probability","block optimized orthogonal matching pursuit","BOOMP","joint channel sparsity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","sparse channel estimation","massive MIMO","large-scale MIMO"]}],"abstract":"The sparse channel estimation which sufficiently exploits the inherent sparsity of wireless channels, is capable of improving the channel estimation performance with less pilot overhead. To reduce the pilot overhead in massive MIMO systems, sparse channel estimation exploring the joint channel sparsity is first proposed, where the channel estimation is modeled as a joint sparse recovery problem. Then the block coherence of MIMO channels is analyzed for the proposed model, which shows that as the number of antennas at the base station grows, the probability of joint recovery of the positions of nonzero channel entries will increase. Furthermore, an improved algorithm named block optimized orthogonal matching pursuit (BOOMP) is also proposed to obtain an accurate channel estimate for the model. Simulation results verify our analysis and show that the proposed scheme exploring joint channel sparsity substantially outperforms the existing methods using individual sparse channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249041","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249041.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4558","endPage":"4563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse channel estimation based on compressed sensing for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse channel estimation based on compressed sensing for massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249041/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438272","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249041/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse channel estimation based on compressed sensing for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570045417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072783S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249042,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085449213"},{"name":"Lu Gan","affiliation":["Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Gan","id":"37266507000"},{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278775200"},{"name":"Cong Ling","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Ling","id":"37275770000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249042","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Training","Scattering","Noise reduction","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","numerical analysis","signal denoising","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic norm denoising","multiple-input multiple-output systems","massive multiuser MIMO systems","channel estimation method","time-division duplexing","TDD","physical channel matrix","alternating direction method of multipliers","ADMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","atomic norm","massive MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation method for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode.

The massive MIMO has been proposed as one of the key technologies for the next generation of wireless communication systems. A major problem in practice to realize the capacity improvement promised by the massive MIMO technology is the availability of the channel state information in downlink at the base station. In frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems, the overhead of the training sequences could overwhelm the precious downlink resources due to the large number of transmit antennas. Therefore, a training sequences design approach that exploits the channel spatial correlation is proposed to reduce the overhead of training sequences. The optimal training sequence structure is analyzed and the length of optimal training sequence which could maximize the achievable data rate is evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulations in this paper. It is shown that the overhead is significantly reduced and a trade-off between accuracy of channel estimation and the system achievable data rate is achieved simultaneously by the proposed training sequences design method.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249043","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4570","endPage":"4575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of downlink training sequences for FDD massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of downlink training sequences for FDD massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437647","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of downlink training sequences for FDD massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106972S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249044,"authors":[{"name":"Shengchu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengchu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077990800"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37292404300"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249044","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Multiuser detection","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","matrix multiplication","maximum likelihood detection","message passing","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","quantisation (signal)","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","massive MIMO","quantized phase-only measurement","MUD","phase quantization","one-bit ADC","sum-product algorithm","central limit theorem","CLT","Taylor expansion","SPA detector","SPAD","PO generalized approximate message passing detector","POG-AMPD","probability distribution","Bayesian manner","matrix-vector multiplication","maximum likelihood detection performance","ML detection performance","BS antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we research the multiuser detection (MUD) in a new massive MIMO with quantized phase-only (PO) measurements.

However, the new problem is how to complete the uplink multiuser detection (MUD) based on the quantized PO measurements. In this paper, it is firstly solved by the sum-product-algorithm (SPA). Based on central limit theorem (CLT) and Taylor expansions, the SPA detector (SPAD) is simplified as a new PO generalized approximate message passing detector (POG-AMPD). POG-AMPD can exploit the quantized phase measurements and signal prior probability distribution in a Bayesian manner. It involves matrix-vector multiplications, and some parallelized non-linear operations, so it is suitable for hardware implementation. Numerical results indicate that POG-AMPD approaches to the maximum likelihood (ML) detection performance. By adopting moderately more BS antennas, massive PO-MIMO can even performs similarly as the conventional massive MIMO with full measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection in massive MIMO with quantized phase-only measurements","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249044","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249044.pdf","startPage":"4576","endPage":"4581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection in massive MIMO with quantized phase-only measurements","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249044/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection in massive MIMO with quantized phase-only measurements","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078772S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249045,"authors":[{"name":"Z.A.

We also demonstrate a practical example of the ToA estimation using real measured indoor channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249050.pdf","startPage":"4612","endPage":"4617","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time of arrival estimation and interference mitigation based on Bayesian compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time of arrival estimation","Interference","Frequency-domain analysis","Channel estimation","Bayes methods","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","compressed sensing","frequency-domain analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time of arrival estimation","interference mitigation","Bayesian compressive sensing","BCS based ToA estimation schemes","posterior probability","channel impulse response","CIR","frequency domain","mean-squared error performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Time of arrival estimation and interference mitigation based on Bayesian compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249050/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438448","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time of arrival estimation and interference mitigation based on Bayesian compressive sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046277S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249053,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Tom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Tom","id":"37658064400"},{"name":"Alphan \u015eahin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX"],"firstName":"Alphan","lastName":"\u015eahin","id":"37705633700"},{"name":"H\u00fcseyin Arslan","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Istanbul Medipol University, Beykoz, \u0130stanbul"],"firstName":"H\u00fcseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249053","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Robustness","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["out-of-band interference reduction","OFDM systems","suppressing alignment","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","cyclic prefix","wireless communications channel","OOB interference suppressing signal","OFDM transmitter","wireless channel","OFDM receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","out-of-band radiation","sidelobe suppression","spectrum shaping","interference alignment"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we introduce a novel approach, called suppressing alignment, to reduce the out-of-band (OOB) interference of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Suppressing alignment exploits the unavoidable redundancy provided by the cyclic prefix (CP) and the wireless communications channel to generate an OOB interference suppressing signal at the OFDM transmitter. However, after passing through the wireless channel, the suppressing signal is aligned with the CP duration at the OFDM receiver, essentially causing no interference to the data portion of the OFDM symbol. The proposed approach reduces the OOB interference by tens of decibels and does not require any change in the receiver structure of legacy OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249053","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249053.pdf","startPage":"4630","endPage":"4634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppressing alignment: An approach for out-of-band interference reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249053/","displayDocTitle":"Suppressing alignment: An approach for out-of-band interference reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249053/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppressing alignment: An approach for out-of-band interference reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062607S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249054,"authors":[{"name":"Hans H.

We assume imperfect channel state information at both BSs and users. The objective is to jointly optimize the precoding, load balancing, and BS operation mode (active or sleep) for improving the energy efficiency of the network. The considered problem is to minimize the weighted total power consumption (both circuit power and dynamic transmit power), while satisfying per-user quality of service constraints and per-BS transmit power constraints. This problem is non-convex, but we prove that for each combination of BS modes, the considered problem has a hidden convexity structure. Thus, the global optimal solution is obtained by an exhaustive search over all possible BS mode combinations. Furthermore, by iterative convex approximations of the non-convex power consumption functions, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain a local optimal solution with low complexity. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithms significantly reduce the total power consumption, compared to the scheme where all BSs are continuously active. This implies that putting a BS into sleep mode by proper load balancing is an important solution for energy savings in heterogeneous networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249059/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438418","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of energy-efficient HetNets: joint precoding and load balancing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of energy-efficient HetNets: joint precoding and load balancing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071372S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249060,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085358930"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249060","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bismuth","Complexity theory","Energy harvesting","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","Markov processes","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-rate variable-power MQAM level","energy harvesting communications","online discrete rate and power adaption policies","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation level","optimal channel threshold","constrained optimization problem","Markov decision process","backward induction method","Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose online discrete rate and power adaption policies based on 1-bit channel feedback for energy harvesting (EH) communications. The receiver (RX) periodically sends 1-bit feedback by comparing the channel power gain with a predetermined threshold. The transmitter (TX) correspondingly adjusts M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) level and transmission power based on the 1-bit feedback and available battery energy. To determine the optimal channel threshold, adaptive MQAM level and corresponding power allocation, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the throughput within a finite horizon. We show that this problem follows a Markov decision process and can be solved via backward induction method. To alleviate the complexity of the backward induction method, we further propose a suboptimal policy. Simulation results show that the optimal policy has higher throughput than the suboptimal policy, but the performance advantage is negligible.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249060","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4670","endPage":"4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for energy harvesting communications with 1-bit feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for energy harvesting communications with 1-bit feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249060/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438143","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249060/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-rate variable-power MQAM for energy harvesting communications with 1-bit feedback","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570042249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088363S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249061,"authors":[{"name":"Anlei Rao","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, KAUST"],"firstName":"Anlei","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085694437"},{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, KAUST"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842400"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, KAUST"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249061","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power demand","Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Covariance matrices","Symmetric matrices","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","least squares approximations","mathematical programming","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDP based design","power minimization","MIMO network","amplify and forward network","relay networks","multiple input multiple output networks","power consumption constraints","quality of service","exact power consumption","quadratic form","minimum square error matrix diagonalization","relay precoding matrix","semidefinite programming relaxation"]}],"abstract":"Relay precoding for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks has been approached by either optimizing the efficiency performance with given power consumption constraints or minimizing the power consumption with quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.

Our simulation results show that such a design can achieve a gain of around 3 dB against the previous design, which optimized the approximated power consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SDP based design of relay precoding for the power minimization of MIMO AF-relay networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249061","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249061.pdf","startPage":"4675","endPage":"4679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A SDP based design of relay precoding for the power minimization of MIMO AF-relay networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249061/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SDP based design of relay precoding for the power minimization of MIMO AF-relay networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074467S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249063,"authors":[{"name":"Xingyu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085340843"},{"name":"Bo Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Bai","id":"37402577600"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291851800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249063","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Mathematical model","Radio frequency","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","mathematical programming","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient relay antenna selection","MIMO two-way relay channels","energy efficiency maximization","amplify and forward MIMO","energy efficient antenna selection algorithm","closed form iterative equation","fractional programming"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization in amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO two-way relay channel (TWRC) combined with relay antenna selection (AS). An iterative energy efficient AS algorithm is proposed to jointly select the active receive and transmit antennas at the relay, as well as optimize the transmission power of the sources and relay. Specifically, the AS at each iteration is based on a derived closed-form iterative equation of EE, which guides us to select a pair of receive and transmit relay antennas that achieves the largest increment of EE under an initial transmission power. After the AS of each iteration, a power adaptation is immediately adopted where we calculate the optimal transmission power using fractional programming and set it as the initial one for the AS of the next iteration. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves nearly the same performance of exhaustive search while with significantly reduced complexity. Moreover, it is capable of simultaneously improving EE and reducing the transmission power.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249063","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249063.pdf","startPage":"4686","endPage":"4691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient relay antenna selection for AF MIMO two-way relay channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249063/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient relay antenna selection for AF MIMO two-way relay channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437844","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249063/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient relay antenna selection for AF MIMO two-way relay channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100937S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249064,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Nissel","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Nissel","id":"37085480413"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249064","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Mathematical model","Estimation","Transfer functions","Noise","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly selective MMSE channel estimation","ICI mitigation","OFDM systems","mobility orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","intercarrier interference","ICI","time-variant channel","minimum mean squared error","data symbols","bit error ratio","BER"]}],"abstract":"In high mobility orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, subcarriers are no longer orthogonal, causing Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). Equalization then becomes more challenging and requires an accurate estimate of the time-variant channel. In this paper, we propose a novel Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimation of the sampled time-variant transfer function. Based on such channel estimation, we propose an iterative three step ICI mitigation technique whereby each step increases the channel estimation accuracy and, consequently, the performance of our MMSE equalization. In Step 1, we consider ICI as an additional noise term. In Step 2, we reduce the ICI at pilot positions and finally, in Step 3, we treat all estimated data symbols, obtained from Step 2, as if they were pilot symbols. We evaluate the Bit Error Ratio (BER) of our ICI mitigation technique by means of simulation and testbed measurements (up to 400 km/h). In both cases, we achieve a BER close to perfect channel knowledge and zero ICI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly-selective MMSE channel estimation and ICI mitigation for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249064","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249064.pdf","startPage":"4692","endPage":"4697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Doubly-selective MMSE channel estimation and ICI mitigation for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249064/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438120","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly-selective MMSE channel estimation and ICI mitigation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570029277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073683S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249065,"authors":[{"name":"Weile Zhang","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weile","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536613100"},{"name":"Qinye Yin","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qinye","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085608923"},{"name":"Huiming Wang","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huiming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085613528"},{"name":"Pengcheng Mu","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Mu","id":"37707474000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249065","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new efficient blind carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems.

By using this property, the minimization of the designed cost function can be solved in a quite computationally efficient manner without any exhausted grid searching procedure.

Because of the existence of two interfering and communication channels, this problem is fundamentally different from the conventional channel estimation problems in half duplex (HD) communication systems. Here, we propose a blind channel estimator that simultaneously estimates the channel parameters of the FD system without requiring time division duplex. A major problem for blind estimators is the identifiability of the parameters. Therefore, thorough analysis is presented to determine the identifiable parameters in this estimation problem. It will be shown that a completely blind estimator utilizing a symmetric modulation set suffers from phase ambiguity. For this reason, only the channel magnitudes can be estimated blindly. It is further presented that if the modulation set is not centered around the origin then this phase ambiguity can be resolved.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4710","endPage":"4714","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249067.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth efficient channel estimation for full duplex communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Modulation","Wireless communication","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","radiocommunication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth efficient channel estimation","full duplex communication system","FD point-to-point wireless communication system","half duplex communication system","HD communication system","blind channel estimator","time division duplex","symmetric modulation set","phase ambiguity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth efficient channel estimation for full duplex communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249067/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249067/","accessionNumber":"15437244","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth efficient channel estimation for full duplex communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.207814S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249071,"authors":[{"name":"Hamdi Joudeh","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Hamdi","lastName":"Joudeh"},{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Clerckx"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249071","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Channel estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Interference","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","channel estimation","mean square error methods","multicast communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum rate maximization","MU-MISO system","channel state information","partial CSIT","base station","imperfect channel estimation","statistical knowledge","average sum rate","power constraint","joint multicasting and broadcasting","JMB","augmented average weighted sum mean square error","alternating optimization","multiple input single output system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint Multicasting and Broadcasting (JMB)","Imperfect CSIT","Robust Design","AWMSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a MU-MISO system where users have highly accurate Channel State Information (CSI), while the Base Station (BS) has partial CSI consisting of an imperfect channel estimate and statistical knowledge of the CSI error.

Both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and FBMC-OQAM suffer from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The classical PAPR reduction schemes suggested for OFDM signals cannot be directly applied on the OFDM-OQM, due to the overlapping structure. In this paper we investigate the problem of PAPR reduction in FBMC-OQAM systems and a trellis-based selected mapping (TSLM) scheme with dynamic programming (DP) has been proposed, which probes for optimal phase rotation vectors. With selected mapping (SLM) scheme, multiple patterns of the modulated signal are generated. Theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that TSLM offer better PAPR reduction performance as compared to symbol-by-symbol approach. Simulation results show that performance of FBMC-OQAM system with this method is not only superior to any scheme based on symbol-by-symbol approach, but also outperforms that of the OFDM with classical SLM scheme. It has also been shown that this result holds for different prototype filter impulse responses that are more or less localized in time or frequency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potency of trellis-based SLM over symbol-by-symbol approach in reducing PAPR for FBMC-OQAM signals","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249075","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249075.pdf","startPage":"4757","endPage":"4762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Potency of trellis-based SLM over symbol-by-symbol approach in reducing PAPR for FBMC-OQAM signals","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249075/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438237","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potency of trellis-based SLM over symbol-by-symbol approach in reducing PAPR for FBMC-OQAM signals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062689S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249076,"authors":[{"name":"M\u00e0rius Caus","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"M\u00e0rius","lastName":"Caus","id":"38358358300"},{"name":"Ana I.

This is due to the inherent lack of orthogonality of FBMC modulations in these situations.

Due to the fact that GFDM uses only one cyclic prefix (CP) for a group of symbols rather than a CP per symbol and it has a well contained spectral properties, it is more bandwidth efficient than the widely used OFDM modulation. In this paper, we propose novel receiver designs for GFDM by taking advantage of the particular structure in the modulation matrix. A unified receiver structure for matched filter (MF), zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers is derived. Our proposed MF receiver is based on sparsification of the modulation matrix using block discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. The proposed ZF and MMSE receiver algorithms in this paper harness the special block circulant property of the matrices involved in the demodulation stage to reduce the computational cost of the system implementation. In addition, our algorithms do not incur any performance loss as no approximation is involved. The computational costs of our proposed techniques are analyzed in detail and are compared with the existing solutions that are known to have the lowest complexity. It should be highlighted that a substantial computational complexity reduction can be achieved by adopting our techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249078.pdf","startPage":"4775","endPage":"4780","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity GFDM receiver design: A new approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","OFDM","Prototypes","Discrete Fourier transforms","Modulation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency division multiplexing","matched filters","mean square error methods","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity GFDM receiver design","generalized frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation technique","5G wireless communication systems","cyclic prefix","modulation matrix","unified receiver structure","matched filter","zero forcing","minimum mean square error receivers","block discrete Fourier transform matrix","computational complexity reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity GFDM receiver design: A new approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249078/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437467","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity GFDM receiver design: A new approach","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076343S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249079,"authors":[{"name":"Zeineb Hraiech","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Laboratory, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Zeineb","lastName":"Hraiech","id":"37085354837"},{"name":"Fatma Abdelkefi","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Laboratory, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Abdelkefi","id":"38478613200"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Laboratory, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37085354625"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249079","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Time-frequency analysis","Prototypes","Optimization","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","future wireless communication systems","maximal spectral efficiency","prototype waveform","time-varying characteristics","strongly delay-spread characteristics","channel propagation","intercarrier interference","ICI","intersymbol interference","ISI","time-frequency dispersion","radio mobile channel","ping-pong optimized pulse shaping-OFDM algorithm","POPS-OFDM algorithm","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR","transmitter","receiver","multicarrier system","Hermite functions","5G systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hermite functions","Inter-Carrier Interference","Inter-Symbol Interference","Optimized Waveforms","POPS-OFDM","SINR","5G"]}],"abstract":"Recently, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has gained more attention as an effective technique for high data rate future wireless communication systems. In order to provide maximal spectral efficiency, the prototype waveform, used in these systems, must guarantee orthogonality even the rapidly time-varying and strongly delay-spread characteristics of the channel propagation. However, its performance gain degrades in the presence of the system Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) which make it essential to develop an efficient technique to overcome these interference over the time-frequency dispersion of the radio mobile channel. In this paper, we propose a Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM) algorithm that maximizes the received Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) by systematically optimizing the OFDM waveforms at the Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) sides. We derived the exact closed-form expression of the SINR of the considered multicarrier system and the optimized waveform is searched as a linear combination of several of the most localized Hermite functions. The results confirm the advantage behind the POPS-OFDM algorithm in enhancing the performance compared to multicarrier systems using conventional waveforms. Simulations are given to support our claims.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249079","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249079.pdf","startPage":"4781","endPage":"4786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POPS-OFDM: Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM for 5G systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249079/","displayDocTitle":"POPS-OFDM: Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM for 5G systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437773","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249079/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POPS-OFDM: Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM for 5G systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067287S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249080,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lin","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085665797"},{"name":"Naila Lahbabi","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Naila","lastName":"Lahbabi","id":"37085666276"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37085500262"},{"name":"Xiwen Jiang","affiliation":["Eurecom, Biot, France"],"firstName":"Xiwen","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085669634"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249080","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Complexity theory","Transceivers","Receivers","Modems","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FTN implementation","OFDM-OQAM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing offset quadrature amplitude modulation","faster-than-Nyquist signaling","iterative detector method","high constellation order transmission"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an implementation method for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) with Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling.

Since CR transceivers need to transmit over multiple non-contiguous frequency holes, multi-carrier based system is one of the best candidates for CR's physical layer design. In this paper, we propose a combined chaotic scrambling (CS) and chaotic shift keying (CSK) scheme in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based CR to enhance its physical layer security. By employing chaos based third order Chebyshev map which allows optimum bit error rate (BER) performance of CSK modulation, the proposed combined scheme outperforms the traditional OFDM system in overlay scenario with Rayleigh fading channel. Importantly, with two layers of encryption based on chaotic scrambling and CSK modulation, large key size can be generated to resist any brute-force attack, leading to a significantly improved level of security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing physical layer security of Cognitive Radio transceiver via chaotic OFDM","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249083","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249083.pdf","startPage":"4805","endPage":"4810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing physical layer security of Cognitive Radio transceiver via chaotic OFDM","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249083/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438383","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing physical layer security of Cognitive Radio transceiver via chaotic OFDM","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056146S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249086,"authors":[{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Univ. of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Jarkko Kaleva","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Univ. of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Kaleva","id":"38229960800"},{"name":"Petri Komulainen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Univ. of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Komulainen","id":"37393360200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249086","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"abstract":"Linear coordinated transmit-receive beamforming methods are proposed for spatial underlay direct device-to-device (D2D) communication in cellular networks where both user terminals (UT) and base stations (BS) employ multiple antenna elements. For a D2D terminal pair, direct communication is a beneficial alternative compared to the cellular mode, where the direct data is relayed via BS. The transmitter and receiver design is formulated as a weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem subject to individual transmit power constraints at BSs and users, where the utility is the aggregate sum of end-to-end data rates carried via uplink, downlink, and D2D links. The direct D2D links are allowed to co-exist with the cellular connections. The original problem is reformulated as an equivalent log-MSE minimization problem allowing alternating optimization of the transmit and receive beamformers. The precoder optimization step is efficiently solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) of the non-convex objective and constraints. According to the results, the system performance can be significantly improved with efficient mode selection between the BS and D2D transmission as opposed to solely serving all the users via D2D links or BS. Also, in certain scenarios, it is beneficial to allow a multi-route connection between the UTs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249086.pdf","startPage":"4822","endPage":"4827","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode selection and transceiver design for rate maximization in underlay D2D MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Uplink","Downlink","Optimization","Transmitters","Approximation methods","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","MIMO communication","minimisation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode selection","transceiver design","rate maximization","underlay D2D MIMO systems","linear coordinated transmit-receive beamforming methods","spatial underlay direct device-to-device communication","cellular networks","user terminals","UT","base stations","BS","weighted sum-rate maximization problem","WSR maximization problem","direct D2D links","log-MSE minimization problem","precoder optimization step","successive convex approximation","SCA","cellular connections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mode selection and transceiver design for rate maximization in underlay D2D MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249086/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437670","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode selection and transceiver design for rate maximization in underlay D2D MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056261S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249088,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37076184500"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085460480"},{"name":"Xiangchuan Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Xiangchuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37596006600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249088","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Fading","Covariance matrices","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","fading channels","Hermitian matrices","MIMO communication","probability","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic SEP analysis","optimally precoded large MIMO channels","ZF detection","symbol error probability","uniformly precoded large correlated MIMO fading channels","zero-forcing detector","mathematical tools","asymptotic behaviors","error performance","large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices","transmitter antennas","SEP approximation","large MIMO systems","multipath scattering","antenna elements","exponential correlation matrix model","channel fading correlation","optimal precoding technique","uniform power allocation strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large MIMO","ZF equalization","Toeplitz matrix","Szeg\u00f6's theorem"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the asymptotic analysis of symbol error probability (SEP) for either optimally precoded or uniformly precoded large correlated MIMO fading channels using the zero-forcing (ZF) detector. For such systems, we reveal some very nice structures which naturally lead us to the exploration of two very strong and very useful mathematical tools for the systematic study of asymptotic behaviors on their error performance. The first tool is the Szeg\u00f6's theorem on large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and the second tool is the well known limit: lim\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x\u2192\u221e</sub>\n(1 + 1/x)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sup>\n = e. This new approach enables us to attain a very simple expression for the SEP limit as the number of the transmitter antennas goes to infinity. One of the major advantages for this method is that its convergence rate is very fast. Hence, this expression is very efficient and effective SEP approximation for the large MIMO systems. Due to the constraint on allowable space and limited (sparse) multi-path scattering, fading correlation between neighbouring antenna elements is almost inevitable in a large MIMO architecture. By specifically examining an exponential correlation matrix model, we show that channel fading correlation can lead to significant performance loss. The optimal precoding technique can yield substantial power gain over the uniform power allocation strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249088","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249088.pdf","startPage":"4834","endPage":"4839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic SEP analysis for optimally precoded large MIMO channels with ZF detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249088/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic SEP analysis for optimally precoded large MIMO channels with ZF detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438051","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249088/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic SEP analysis for optimally precoded large MIMO channels with ZF detection","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071633S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249090,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan C.

Furthermore, Space-Time Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (ST-BICM) based channel coding schemes are considered, i.e. convolutional or turbo code based, and the system performance is evaluated in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) over MIMO Rayleigh fading channels. The proposed near-optimal IDD scheme performs cancellation of SI by iteratively exchanging the soft information of the desired and SI signals between the detector, which comprises adaptive MMSE filtering with log-likelihood ratio (LLR) demapping, and the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder implementing linear to logarithmic approximation of the maximum a posteriori algorithm. Performance results are presented to demonstrate the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of the proposed coded FD-MIMO as a function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed IDD system with relevant state-of-the-art approaches is given which shows a significant improvement in performance as a result of the introduced iterative processing that reduces SI considerably.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249092/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437728","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coded full-duplex MIMO with iterative detection and decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded full-duplex MIMO with iterative detection and decoding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04549S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249097,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37715133100"},{"name":"Ian J.

The majority of the theoretical results derived within CS are expressed in terms of the known sparsity order of the signal. In this work we address the problem of sparsity order estimation of multiband signals with unknown sparse spectral supports. We show that it can be estimated directly in the compressed domain as the dimension of the signal subspace of the observations' covariance matrix. We analyze how the results of the sparsity estimation can be utilized during the reconstruction step and which requirements it imposes on the performance of the subspace estimation algorithms. The results of the numerical study demonstrate that the reconstruction step is particularly sensitive to type II errors. This in turn indicates that the classical non-parametric model order selection algorithms might be unfavorable for this application since they tend to underestimate model order in the low SNR regime. As a remedy we propose to apply parametric approaches that allow to compromise resulting probabilities of over- and underestimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249100/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437252","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity order estimation for sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery of sparse multiband signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity order estimation for sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery of sparse multiband signals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05722S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249101,"authors":[{"name":"Trung-Hien Nguyen","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Trung-Hien","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38576767500"},{"name":"Pascal Scalart","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Campus Beaulieu, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Scalart","id":"37284469800"},{"name":"Michel Joindot","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Joindot","id":"37297486500"},{"name":"Mathilde Gay","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Mathilde","lastName":"Gay","id":"37394704300"},{"name":"Laurent Bramerie","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Bramerie","id":"37085540831"},{"name":"Christophe Peucheret","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Peucheret","id":"37085422428"},{"name":"Arnaud Carer","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Campus Beaulieu, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Carer","id":"37845932900"},{"name":"Jean-Claude Simon","affiliation":["FOTON Laboratory, CNRS, University of Rennes 1, ENSSAT, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Simon","id":"37269861700"},{"name":"Olivier Sentieys","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Campus Beaulieu, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sentieys","id":"37085556675"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249101","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Finite impulse response filters","Optical fibers","Optical transmitters","Optical filters","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","FIR filters","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical filters","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint simple blind IQ imbalance compensation","adaptive equalization","16-QAM optical communication","in-phase-quadrature imbalance","m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation coherent optical fiber communication system","butterfly-structured finite impulse response filter","FIR filter","hardware complexity reduction","power penalty reduction","bit error rate","BER","group velocity dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent optical fiber communications","m-QAM","IQ imbalance","adaptive filter"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel simple blind adaptive compensation method for in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance in m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM) coherent optical fiber communication systems.

Assuming practical imperfect eavesdroppers' channel state information (ECSI), we propose a robust approach to optimize the relay AF matrix, subject to power constraint, in order to maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the destination while satisfying a set of secrecy constraints. The ECSI errors are assumed to fall within some predefined bounded sets. Since the resultant optimization problem is non-convex and semi-infinite, we transform it into a form constituted by the differences of convex functions (DC) using suitable matrix transformation techniques. Then an algorithmic solution with proven convergence is proposed by resorting to the penalty-DC algorithm (P-DCA).

Each round of data exchange consists of one uplink transmission from users to relay and one downlink transmission from relay back to users. The data exchange model is unicast, i.e., every user transmits one message and intends to receive one message from one other user. We categorize unicast patterns using the notion of orbit borrowed from abstract algebra. Roughly speaking, an orbit is a minimum subset of users such that data exchange is closed within this subset. We analyze the achievable DoF of wireless MIMO switching with various numbers of orbits. Particularly, the DoF capacity for unicast with one and two orbits are established. Furthermore, we study communication secrecy with an untrusted relay in wireless MIMO switching. We present an achievable secrecy sum rate and the corresponding achievable secrecy DoF by assuming a non-regenerative relay. Then, we focus on unicast patterns with one and two orbits, and show that this achievable lower bound is actually the secrecy DoF capacity based on a novel genie-aided technique. Our results build a bridge between the DoF and the secrecy DoF in multiway relaying. The methodology of the proof can be generally applied to analyze the secrecy DoF in other relay networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249106.pdf","startPage":"4943","endPage":"4948","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless MIMO switching with trusted and untrusted relays: Degrees of freedom perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Switches","Wireless communication","Orbits","Unicast","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless MIMO switching","untrusted relays","trusted relays","multiway relay networks","DoF capacity","communication secrecy","nonregenerative relay","novel genie-aided technique","multiway relaying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degrees of freedom","MIMO switching","physical-layer network coding","multiway relay","secrecy sum rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless MIMO switching with trusted and untrusted relays: Degrees of freedom perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249106/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437643","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless MIMO switching with trusted and untrusted relays: Degrees of freedom perspective","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074548S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249107,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwen Jiang","affiliation":["EURECOM, Campus Sophia Tech., Biot, France"],"firstName":"Xiwen","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085755973"},{"name":"Mirsad \u010cirki\u0107","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden","Ericsson, Ericsson Research, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mirsad","lastName":"\u010cirki\u0107","id":"37085434062"},{"name":"Florian Kaltenberger","affiliation":["EURECOM, Campus Sophia Tech., Biot, France"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kaltenberger","id":"37392197300"},{"name":"Erik G.

However when the transceivers' radio frequency (RF) hardware is taken into consideration, TDD channel reciprocity no longer holds because of the non-symmetric characteristics of RF transmit and receive chains. Relative calibration has been proposed to compensate this hardware impairment with a multiplicative matrix. In this paper we perform hardware measurements on this calibration matrix which gives a direct insight on the physical phenomenon of TDD transceivers. Especially, we inspect the assumption that this calibration matrix is diagonal, which is widely adopted in literature but has never been verified by experiments.

Under practical transmitter imperfections, the received SI is affected by transmitter nonlinearities and propagation channel, which need to be estimated in order to cancel the SI. The proposed estimation method is based on subspace decomposition. The major detriment of subspace technique is the need of oversampling or multisensor receiver to obtain a nondegerate noise subspace. We modify the traditional subspace techniques by exploiting the covariance and the pseudo-covariance of the received signal. This enables us to increase the dimension of the received signal without resulting to oversampling or multisensor receiver. The different parameters are estimated, up to an ambiguity term, without any knowledge of the intended signal. We develop a joint detection and ambiguity identification procedure that requires a considerably smaller number of pilots than standard training-based methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can properly estimate the SI channel coefficients and the nonlinear parameters without any pilot symbol from the intended transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249108","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4954","endPage":"4959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital subspace-based self-interference cancellation in full-duplex MIMO transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A digital subspace-based self-interference cancellation in full-duplex MIMO transceivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249108/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437221","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249108/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital subspace-based self-interference cancellation in full-duplex MIMO transceivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051987S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249109,"authors":[{"name":"Kangqi Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kangqi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085509725"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao","id":"37283006000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249109","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Upper bound","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Null space"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","DoF upper bound","K-user MIMO Y channels","DoF analysis","antenna configurations","signal group based alignment","signal pattern approach","source node","relay node","genie-aided approach","generalized signal alignment","GSA"]}],"abstract":"This work is to study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the K-user MIMO Y channel.

Assuming each mobile station can only be assigned to one base station, our design objective is to minimize the sum transmit power across the base stations with a set of target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios at the mobile stations. Since the original optimization problem involves binary variables for base station associations, finding its optimal solution is a challenging task. To circumvent this difficulty, the original problem is relaxed into a new optimization problem by expanding its constraint set. Interestingly, it is shown that the relaxed problem can be solved optimally and its solution is also optimal to the original problem. We then propose two solution approaches to tackle the relaxed problem: one via its Lagrangian dual problem and the other via its dual uplink problem. Simulation results show that the resulting jointly optimal base station association and beamforming design can significantly outperform fixed base station association schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249110/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15437443","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal joint base station association and beamforming design for downlink transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal joint base station association and beamforming design for downlink transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023443S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7249110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249111,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia A.

Compared with its static counterpart, channel estimation in high mobility scenarios consumes excessive energy and spectrum to achieve similar performance. To address this issue, we exploit delay correlation with sequential antenna-hopping (AH) to convert the rapid fading channels to a virtual slow-fading channel. As a result, robust communication can be achieved with much less channel estimation overhead even under high mobility. Finally, two important performance metrics, namely, channel estimation mean square error (MSE) and transmission symbol error rate (SER), are re-examined for this virtual slow-fading channel. Numerical results verify the good performance of the proposed scheme and elucidate its effectiveness in high mobility communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249113","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"4984","endPage":"4989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequential antenna-hopping scheme for high mobility MIMO communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sequential antenna-hopping scheme for high mobility MIMO communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249113/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438059","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249113/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential antenna-hopping scheme for high mobility MIMO communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053958S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249114,"authors":[{"name":"Moonsik Min","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moonsik","lastName":"Min","id":"38548365900"},{"name":"Gi-Hong Im","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gi-Hong","lastName":"Im","id":"37265558500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249114","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Multiplexing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","MIMO","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","feedback","MIMO communication","multiplexing","quantisation (signal)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel quantization","limited feedback-based block diagonalization","BD","multiple antenna MIMO broadcast channel","multiuser interference","chordal distance","ChD","quantization measure","signal to noise ratio","SNR","wireless communication","sum capacity","multiplexing gain"]}],"abstract":"We consider block diagonalization (BD) based on limited feedback for multiple-antenna broadcast channels. With limited feedback, achievable sum rate is reduced due to multi-user interference. When the chordal distance (ChD) is used as a quantization measure, the number of quantization bits should scale with the signal to noise ratio (SNR) to guarantee full multiplexing gain of MIMO channel. Although the ChD can be used to prove such bit-scaling law, it is not an optimal quantization criterion for limited-feedback-based BD. Moreover, the required number of quantization bits for full multiplexing gain is too large to be realized in practical wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a more-appropriate quantization criterion for channel direction information that can achieve much higher sum capacity with moderate feedback rate than can ChD. We also consider a sufficient condition for quantization bits to maintain achievable multiplexing gain of the proposed quantization criterion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel quantization for limited feedback-based block diagonalization in MIMO broadcast channels","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249114","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249114.pdf","startPage":"4990","endPage":"4995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel quantization for limited feedback-based block diagonalization in MIMO broadcast channels","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249114/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437801","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel quantization for limited feedback-based block diagonalization in MIMO broadcast channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077618S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249115,"authors":[{"name":"Merve Turan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Merve","lastName":"Turan","id":"37085652818"},{"name":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7 \u00d6ner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7","lastName":"\u00d6ner","id":"37268389500"},{"name":"Hakan \u00c7\u0131rpan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"\u00c7\u0131rpan","id":"37347283800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249115","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"Blind and noncooperative identification of the transmission parameters of unknown communication signals has been employed both in military and civilian applications.

The network throughput, end-to-end packet delay and packet loss rate are evaluated by means of both service level agreement and class-of-service differentiation. As a result the packet delay at 80% ONU offered load is less than 3 ms even for the lowest service level ONUs.

Scintillations are typically modeled by the log-normal and Gamma-Gamma distributions for weak and strong turbulence conditions, respectively. In this paper, we propose and study a generalized pointing error model based on the Beckmann distribution. We then derive the asymptotic ergodic capacity of FSO systems under the joint impact of turbulence and generalized pointing error impairments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249128.pdf","startPage":"5072","endPage":"5077","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the asymptotic ergodic capacity of FSO links with generalized pointing error model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Atmospheric modeling","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive optics","Integrated optics","Optical transmitters","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","gamma distribution","log normal distribution","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic ergodic capacity","FSO links","generalized pointing error model","free-space optical communication systems","scintillation","atmospheric turbulence","Gamma-Gamma distributions","log-normal distributions","Beckmann distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free-space optical","log-normal fading","Gamma-Gamma fading","Ergodic capacity","asymptotic","high SNR","pointing errors","Beckmann distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the asymptotic ergodic capacity of FSO links with generalized pointing error model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249128/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438283","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the asymptotic ergodic capacity of FSO links with generalized pointing error model","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049202S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249129,"authors":[{"name":"Shenjie Huang","affiliation":["The Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Shenjie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085641781"},{"name":"Majid Safari","affiliation":["The Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Safari","id":"37313601600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249129","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249129","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coherence","Apertures","Photonics","Optical receivers","Integrated optics","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","direction-of-arrival estimation","diversity reception","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","atmospheric angular spread","optical detection scheme","turbulence-induced effect","angle-of-arrival fluctuation","AOA fluctuation","log-amplitude fluctuations","atmospheric turbulence","channel modelling","FSO receiver","optimal receiver field-of-view","FOV","coherent detection","spatial diversity receiver"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249129","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249129.pdf","startPage":"5078","endPage":"5083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-space optical communication in the presence of atmospheric angular spread","abstract":"In this paper, different optical detection schemes are investigated in the presence of turbulence-induced effects.

These schemes have a reduced spectral efficiency due to the restrictions imposed on their frame structure. The enhanced unipolar OFDM (eU-OFDM) modulation scheme was recently introduced to compensate for the reduced spectral efficiency in unipolar OFDM (U-OFDM). The concept exploits the frame structure of U-OFDM and allows for multiple U-OFDM information streams to be combined, thus increasing the overall spectral efficiency of the communication system. In this paper, the concept of the enhanced U-OFDM scheme is generalized for arbitrary combinations of U-OFDM data streams with various constellation sizes and various power allocations. A closed-form theoretical bound on the bit error rate (BER) performance of the GeneRalizEd EnhaNcEd unipolaR OFDM (GREENER-OFDM) is derived and verified by comparison with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed scheme has an improved power efficiency compared with a spectrally equivalent DCO-OFDM. The GREENER-OFDM allows the gap in spectral efficiency between DCO-OFDM and the inherently unipolar optical OFDM schemes to be completely closed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International

wireless communication systems with intensity modulation (IM) and direct detection (DD), diffuse links could be established through reflecting. For such a case, line-of-sight does not exist between the transmitter and receiver, and the channel delay spread will be large. The dispersion of the channel might cause inter-symbol interference. Also, the transmitted signal must be nonnegative. Thus most modulation schemes for radio communications cannot be used directly for such a system. This paper develops a new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) IM/DD systems: real and imaginary coefficients separation (RIS) system. Two transmit data streams require only one inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) block, resulting in a low computational complexity. Compared with traditional OFDM based schemes, the RIS scheme achieves a better BER performance and requires fewer IFFT blocks at the transmitter. The transmitter architecture and receiver algorithm are analyzed in detail. BER performance and simulation results are provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coefficients separation MIMO-OFDM optical wireless communication system in diffuse fading channels","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249138","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249138.pdf","startPage":"5132","endPage":"5137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coefficients separation MIMO-OFDM optical wireless communication system in diffuse fading channels","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249138/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437858","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coefficients separation MIMO-OFDM optical wireless communication system in diffuse fading channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570046665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080322S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249140,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza A.

We assume intensity modulation/direct detection with on-off keying and present the BER performance of single-input multiple-output (SIMO), multiple-input single-output (MISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems over this new channel model.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"5144","endPage":"5149","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249140.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of MIMO FSO communications over Double Generalized Gamma fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Receivers","Atmospheric modeling","MIMO","Apertures","Diversity reception","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","atmospheric turbulence","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","gamma distribution","intensity modulation","MIMO communication","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO FSO communication","double generalized gamma fading channel","free space optical communication system","spatial diversity technique","turbulence-induced fading mitigation","FSO link error rate performance","atmospheric turbulence channel","double generalized gamma distribution","generic statistical model","intensity modulation-direct detection","on-off keying","BER performance","single input multiple output FSO system","SIMO FSO system","multiple input single output system","MISO system","multiple input multiple output FSO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric turbulence","Double GG distribution","bit error rate","error rate performance analysis","Free-space optical systems","spatial diversity","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of MIMO FSO communications over Double Generalized Gamma fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249140/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249140/","accessionNumber":"15438487","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of MIMO FSO communications over Double Generalized Gamma fading channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061963S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249144,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Foggi","affiliation":["CNIT Research Unit, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Foggi","id":"37546427500"},{"name":"Giulio Colavolpe","affiliation":["Dip.

A tighter channel spacing, however, requires narrower filters, which increase linear intersymbol interference (ISI), and may dramatically reduce system reach. Commercial coherent receivers are based on symbol by symbol detectors, which are quite sensitive to ISI. In this context, Nyquist spacing is considered as the ultimate limit to wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) packing. In this paper, we show that by introducing a limited-complexity trellis processing in the receiver, either the reach of Nyquist WDM flexi-grid networks can be significantly extended, or a higher spectral efficiency (SE) is possible at equal reach. By adopting information-theoretic techniques, we design a limited-complexity trellis processing and quantify its SE gain in flexi-grid architectures where wavelength selective switches over a frequency grid with 12.5GHz granularity are employed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Optical fiber networks","Optical receivers","Parity check codes","Nonlinear optics","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel spacing","frequency allocation","intersymbol interference","optical fibre networks","optical receivers","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexi-grid long-haul optical systems","filtering penalty","flexible grid optical networks","fiber capacity","frequency allocation","channel spacing","linear intersymbol interference","coherent receivers","symbol detectors","Nyquist spacing","wavelength division multiplexing","limited-complexity trellis processing","Nyquist WDM flexi-grid networks","frequency 12.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communications","Coherent detection","Nonlinear propagation","Nyquist-WDM","Time-frequency packing","Polarization-multiplexed quaternary phase-shift keying","Flexi-grid","ROADM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249144","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249144.pdf","startPage":"5168","endPage":"5173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming filtering penalties in flexi-grid long-haul optical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming filtering penalties in flexi-grid long-haul optical systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249144/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249144/","accessionNumber":"15437248","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming filtering penalties in flexi-grid long-haul optical systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058857S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7249150,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

For these or similar strategies to achieve their objectives, accurate estimators of the EDFA output power (EOP) are of the essence. These EOP estimators must take into account the amplifier characteristics including unequal power values of the input signals, frequency of each signal and desired target gain for each amplifier. The scope of this paper is to propose and assess the accuracy of three EOP efficient linear estimators. The EOP estimators are part of a framework comprising four modules, which are simple to implement and flexible to use. The proposed estimators are efficient in that they compute EOP estimates in seconds and require only a limited set of EDFA measured data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249153/","accessionNumber":"15437535","displayDocTitle":"Estimating EDFA output power with an efficient numerical modeling framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating EDFA output power with an efficient numerical modeling framework","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05068S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249165,"authors":[{"name":"Jingpu Duan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jingpu","lastName":"Duan","id":"37085638031"},{"name":"Zhi Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37598005600"},{"name":"Chuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085636961"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249165","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":725},"abstract":"A basic need in datacenter networks is to provide high throughput for large flows such as the massive shuffle traffic flows in a MapReduce application. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has been investigated as an effective approach toward this goal, by spreading one TCP flow onto multiple paths. However, the current MPTCP implementation has two major limitations: (1) a fixed number of subflows are used without reacting to the actual traffic condition; (2) the routing of subflows of a multipath TCP connection relies heavily on the ECMP-based random hashing. The former may lead to a waste of both the server and network resources, while the latter can cause throughput degradation when multiple subflows collide on the same path. This paper proposes a responsive MPTCP system to resolve the two limitations simultaneously. Our system employs a centralized controller for intelligent subflow route calculation and a monitor running on each server for actively adjusting the number of subflows. Working in synergy, the two modules enable MPTCP flows to respond to the traffic conditions and pursue high throughput on the fly, at very low computation and messaging overhead. NS3-based experiments show that our system achieves satisfactory throughput with less resource overhead, or better throughput at similar amounts of overhead, as compared to common alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249165.pdf","startPage":"5296","endPage":"5301","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Responsive multipath TCP in SDN-based datacenters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Monitoring","Servers","Control systems","Aggregates","Estimation","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralised control","computer centres","routing protocols","software defined networking","telecommunication control","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["responsive multipath TCP","SDN-based data center network","MapReduce","massive shuffle traffic flows","ECMP-based random hashing","network resources","throughput degradation","responsive MPTCP system","centralized controller","intelligent subflow route calculation","NS3-based experiments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Responsive multipath TCP in SDN-based datacenters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249165/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437787","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Responsive multipath TCP in SDN-based datacenters","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052142S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249176,"authors":[{"name":"Hazem Ibrahim","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hazem","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37085736591"},{"name":"Hesham ElSawy","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"ElSawy","id":"38523664000"},{"name":"Uyen T.

Network densification increases the spatial frequency reuse efficiency while maintaining the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) performance, hence, increases the spatial spectral efficiency and improves the overall network performance. However, control signaling in such dense networks consumes considerable bandwidth and limits the densification gain. Radio access network (RAN) virtualization via control plane (C-plane) and user plane (U-plane) splitting has been recently proposed to lighten the control signaling burden and improve the network throughput. In this paper, we present a tractable analytical model for virtualized downlink cellular networks, using tools from stochastic geometry. We then apply the developed modeling framework to obtain design insights for virtualized RANs and quantify associated performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249176","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249176.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"5360","endPage":"5366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling virtualized downlink cellular networks with ultra-dense small cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling virtualized downlink cellular networks with ultra-dense small cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249176/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438364","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249176/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling virtualized downlink cellular networks with ultra-dense small cells","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065529S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249179,"authors":[{"name":"Hisham Elshaer","affiliation":["Vodafone Group R&D, Newbury, UK","King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hisham","lastName":"Elshaer","id":"37085335853"},{"name":"Federico Boccardi","affiliation":["Vodafone Group R&D, Newbury, UK"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Boccardi","id":"37294661800"},{"name":"Mischa Dohler","affiliation":["King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mischa","lastName":"Dohler","id":"37273439700"},{"name":"Ralf Irmer","affiliation":["Vodafone Group R&D, Newbury, UK"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Irmer","id":"37426927200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249179","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Power control","Throughput","Load management","Downlink","Art","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","radio equipment","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backhaul aware decoupled downlink-uplink access","load aware decoupled downlink-uplink access","5G systems","cellular 3GPP systems","4G cellular systems","user equipment","cell association","pathloss prediction","realistic user distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Load-Balancing","Backhaul Capacity","Heterogeneous Networks","Downlink and Uplink Decoupling"]}],"abstract":"Until the 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n Generation (4G) cellular 3GPP systems, a user equipment's (UE) cell association has been based on the downlink received power from the strongest base station.

In this paper, we advance prior art by explicitly considering the cell-load as well as the available backhaul capacity during the association process. We introduce a novel association algorithm and prove its superiority w.r.t. prior art by means of simulations that are based on Vodafone's small cell trial network and employing a high resolution pathloss prediction and realistic user distributions.

This paper demonstrates how D2D communication can be used to improve the energy-efficiency of cellular networks, leading to a greener system operation and a prolonged battery life of the mobile devices. Assuming a flexible TDD system, we develop optimal mode selection policies for minimizing the energy cost (either from the system or from the device perspective) while guaranteeing a certain rate requirement. The jointly optimal transmit power and time allocation, as well as the optimal mode selection, is found by solving a small convex optimization problem. Special attention is given to the geometrical interpretation of the obtained results. We show that when network energy is the primary concern, D2D mode is preferable in a large portion of the cell. When the device energy consumption is most important, on the other hand, the area where D2D mode is preferable shrinks and becomes close to circular. Finally, we investigate how network parameters affect the range where direct communication is preferred.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249183","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249183.pdf","startPage":"5404","endPage":"5409","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode selection for energy efficient D2D communications in dynamic TDD systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mode selection for energy efficient D2D communications in dynamic TDD systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437638","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249183/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode selection for energy efficient D2D communications in dynamic TDD systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570042553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063252S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249185,"authors":[{"name":"Saman Atapattu","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Atapattu","id":"37395727200"},{"name":"Hai Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085491222"},{"name":"Jamie Evans","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Evans","id":"37085363108"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37085488004"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249185","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":674},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Approximation methods","Fading","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","energy harvesting","optimisation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time switching energy harvesting","wireless energy harvesting relay network","time switching protocol","throughput maximisation","relay selection","numerical simulation","diversity reception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","relay selection","outage probability","throughput"]}],"abstract":"We consider a wireless energy harvesting (EH) relay network.

These strategies are devised so that to minimize the energy consumption of the mobile terminals while satisfying predefined delay constraints. We compare online learning based solutions where the network adapts dynamically to the application that is run on mobile terminals, and pre-calculated offline solutions which are employed when a certain level of knowledge about the application and the channel conditions is available at the network side.

However, this substantial coding gain is attained at the cost of large delivery delay, which is not tolerable in delay-sensitive applications such as video streaming. In this paper, we identify and investigate the tradeoff between the performance gain of coded caching and the delivery delay. We propose a computationally efficient caching algorithm that provides the gains of coding and respects delay constraints. The proposed algorithm achieves the optimum performance for large delay, but still offers major gains for small delay. These gains are demonstrated in a practical setting with a video-streaming prototype.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249208","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249208.pdf","startPage":"5559","endPage":"5564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded caching for delay-sensitive content","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coded caching for delay-sensitive content","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249208/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438081","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249208/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded caching for delay-sensitive content","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570036063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084639S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7249214,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sai Qian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085344433"},{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085341127"},{"name":"Hadi Bannazadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Bannazadeh","id":"38269966600"},{"name":"Alberto Leon-Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Leon-Garcia","id":"38270617400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249214","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":821},"abstract":"Many multicast services such as live multimedia distribution and real-time event monitoring require constructing a multicast mechanism that involves network functions (e.g. firewall, video transcoding).

To further improve spectrum efficiency in next-generation wireless networks, however, a promising direction is to shift to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To address the new technical challenges brought forth by NOMA, in this paper we investigate the problem of scheduling multiple NOMA users in the same resource block previously dedicated to a single user in OFDMA. Unlike related work that relies on the ideal link capacity model for profiling the performance gain of NOMA, we start by implementing a more practical NOMA simulator to investigate problems such as modulation/coding scheme (MCS) selection, power allocation, and error propagation along with transmission scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for transmission scheduling with the goal of providing proportional fairness to the set of users served by a base station. We then propose a method to integrate physical-layer simulation into a meta-heuristic search algorithm for solving the joint optimization problem. Evaluation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively solve the problem in the target scenario and NOMA can achieve significant performance benefits over OMA, thus motivating further investigation along this direction.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249220","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249220.pdf","startPage":"5633","endPage":"5638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving towards non-orthogonal multiple access in next-generation wireless access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249220/","displayDocTitle":"Moving towards non-orthogonal multiple access in next-generation wireless access networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437445","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249220/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving towards non-orthogonal multiple access in next-generation wireless access networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110137S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249223,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuhua Li","affiliation":["Dept.

However, the wireless link capacity, the radio access networks, and MNOs' backhaul networks cannot deal with the traffic load effectively. To solve this problem, content caching is regarded as an effective emerging technique to reduce the duplicated transmissions of the content downloads demanded by mobile users and improve users' quality of service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, we mainly focus on the cooperative cell caching for future mobile networks, where each cell (e.g., base station) can cache popular contents for improving QoS especially on the overall delay performance of users. The task is formulated as a problem of minimizing the expected overall user delay of accessing the demanded contents. Instead of rewriting it as a non-linear and non-convex problem based on an approximate transformation, we convert it to a linear programming problem by using a novel equivalent transformation. To solve the problem, rather than using the existing branchand-bound (BNB) method, which suffers from exponential-time and exponential-space complexity, we propose a new distributed suboptimal algorithm, which has polynomial-time and linearspace complexity. Numerical evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed cooperative cell caching framework can reduce the expected overall delay significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249223","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249223.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"5652","endPage":"5657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay performance analysis of cooperative cell caching in future mobile networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay performance analysis of cooperative cell caching in future mobile networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249223/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438414","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249223/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay performance analysis of cooperative cell caching in future mobile networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097948S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249249,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Tavana","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Tavana","id":"37085756555"},{"name":"Vahid Shah-Mansouri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Shah-Mansouri","id":"38275680000"},{"name":"Vincent W.S.

An MTC device randomly chooses a preamble from a pool of preambles and transmits it during the RACH. The evolved node B (eNodeB) acknowledges the successful reception of a preamble if that preamble is transmitted by only one device. To reduce the burstiness of the connection requests in heavy traffic situations, access class barring (ACB) is proposed in the 3GPP standard. Using ACB, an MTC device postpones its request in a RACH with a probability p. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive ACB scheme for congestion control of bursty M2M traffic. The optimal value of the ACB depends on the total number of MTC devices competing in a RACH. To estimate this number, we derive a joint conditional probability distribution function (PDF) for the number of preambles selected by zero or one MTC device, conditioned on the number of MTC devices that passed the ACB check. We design a maximum likelihood estimator using this PDF. We use this estimation to dynamically adjust the ACB factor. To further improve our estimation, we use Kalman filtering based on the dynamics of the system. Numerical results show that the total service time for the proposed method is very close to the optimal case where the information of the number of MTC devices is given.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249249","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249249.pdf","startPage":"5815","endPage":"5820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion control for bursty M2M traffic in LTE networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Congestion control for bursty M2M traffic in LTE networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438065","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249249/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion control for bursty M2M traffic in LTE networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068269S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7249250,"authors":[{"name":"Nusrat Afrin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science The University of Newcastle Callaghan, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Nusrat","lastName":"Afrin","id":"37085506326"},{"name":"Jason Brown","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science The University of Newcastle Callaghan, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Brown","id":"38579547800"},{"name":"Jamil Y Khan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science The University of Newcastle Callaghan, NSW, AUSTRALIA"],"firstName":"Jamil Y","lastName":"Khan","id":"37275082200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249250","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"abstract":"One of the major limitations of the LTE system in context of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications is the excessive control signalling required for dynamic scheduling of radio resources. Although the queue awareness and link adaptation features of the dynamic scheduler can be very beneficial for M2M traffic as well, these two properties come at a cost of significant control overhead. In this paper, we propose an adaptive semi-persistent LTE uplink scheduler which reduces the control overhead by a significant level and utilizes the uplink capacity efficiently to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of M2M traffic. The concept of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) has already been implemented for Voice over IP (VoIP) service in the LTE standard. However, we have further developed this into an adaptive SPS scheme which can adapt to the sudden bursts of stochastic M2M traffic flow by utilizing the device buffer information as well as respond to the channel fluctuations caused by fading while satisfying the M2M packet delay constraints. The performance of the proposed adaptive SPS scheme has been compared to an LTE dynamic scheduler using the OPNET simulation software for fading channels. The simulation results demonstrate the adaptive SPS scheme to outperform the dynamic scheduler in terms of both control channel utilization and satisfying QoS requirements of M2M traffic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Dynamic scheduling","Fading","Delays","Resource management","Indexes","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scheduling","fading channels","Internet telephony","Long Term Evolution","quality of service","queueing theory","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer adaptive LTE","channel adaptive LTE","M2M communication","machine-to-machine communication","radio resource scheduling","queue awareness","link adaptation feature","M2M traffic","adaptive semi-persistent LTE uplink scheduler","uplink capacity","quality of service","QoS","SPS","voice over IP","VoIP service","device buffer information","channel fluctuation","M2M packet delay constraint","OPNET simulation software","fading channel","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","M2M","Fading channel","packet scheduling","semi-persistent","delay"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249250","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249250.pdf","startPage":"5821","endPage":"5826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a buffer and channel adaptive LTE semi-persistent scheduler for M2M communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a buffer and channel adaptive LTE semi-persistent scheduler for M2M communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249250/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249250/","accessionNumber":"15438235","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a buffer and channel adaptive LTE semi-persistent scheduler for M2M communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054236S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7249257,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Antunes","affiliation":["Center for Computacional and Stochastic Mathematics University of Lisbon and University of Algarve, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Antunes","id":"37605473000"},{"name":"Vladas Pipiras","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Operations Research University of North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Vladas","lastName":"Pipiras","id":"37573428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249257","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249257","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Internet","Distribution functions","Random variables","Reliability","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic monitoring","flow distributions","traffic estimation","mathematical framework","censoring analysis","nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators","flow duration","size distributions","EM algorithm","real Internet trace"]}],"abstract":"Traffic monitoring and estimation of flow characteristics, such as the size and duration distributions, can be problematic when the length of an observation window is constrained (e.g., due to hard network resources). Indeed, as shown in this work, sampled flows are usually affected by censoring in an observation window, which leads to biased estimators. To account for censoring, a mathematical framework that describes sampling of flows in a time window is developed. Using censoring analysis, we provide nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators for the flow duration and size distributions. The estimators are computed using the EM algorithm. Finally, the estimators are applied to an actual traffic trace, and are found to perform very well.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249257","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249257.pdf","startPage":"5865","endPage":"5871","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and censoring in estimation of flow distributions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and censoring in estimation of flow distributions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249257/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437755","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249257/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and censoring in estimation of flow distributions","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570024425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062007S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249268,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Pappas","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linkoping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Pappas","id":"37543533000"},{"name":"Johan Gunnarsson","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linkoping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Gunnarsson","id":"37322677300"},{"name":"Ludvig Kratz","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linkoping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ludvig","lastName":"Kratz","id":"37085682679"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

In the model we study, the packet generation time may vary at each source, and the packets go through the network with a random delay. Each update carries a time stamp of its generation, allowing the destination to calculate for each source the so called Age of Information, which measures the timeliness of each status update arriving. Considering that queuing delay can unnecessarily increase the age of a critical status update, we propose here a queue management technique, in which we maintain a queue with only the latest status packet of each source, overwriting any previously queued update from that source. This simple technique drastically limits the need for buffering and can be applied in systems where the history of source status is not relevant. We show that this scheme results in significantly less transmissions compared to the standard M/M/1 queue model. Furthermore, the proposed technique reduces the per source age of information, especially in settings not using queue management with high status update generation rates.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249268","startPage":"5935","endPage":"5940","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249268.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age of information of multiple sources with queue management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249268/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Age of information of multiple sources with queue management","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437910","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249268/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age of information of multiple sources with queue management","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079979S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7249273,"authors":[{"name":"Dionysia Triantafyllopoulou","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems (ICS) University of Surrey Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Dionysia","lastName":"Triantafyllopoulou","id":"37542772600"},{"name":"Klaus Moessner","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems (ICS) University of Surrey Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Moessner","id":"37283643500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249273","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Resource management","Downlink","Quality of service","Energy efficiency","Scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation algorithm","quality of service provision","QoS provision","energy efficiency","downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","downlink OFDMA systems","downlink packet delay","average delay","buffer status","packet segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)","Quality of Service (QoS)","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present and evaluate the performance of a resource allocation algorithm to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) provision and energy efficiency of downlink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems.

While the use of energy harvesters ideally provides infinite lifetime, the unpredictable amount of harvested energy may not guarantee that all data transmissions can be done in due time because of temporary energy shortages. We propose in this paper the Energy Harvesting-aware Reservation Dynamic Frame Slotted-ALOHA (EH-RDFSA) protocol as a solution suitable for managing the access of end-devices that transmit bursts of data packets while taking into account the energy availability. We derive a model based on a discrete-time Markov chain to analyze the evolution of the energy available in an end-device and to evaluate the performance of the network. In particular, we compute the data delivery ratio, which measures the ability of the protocol to successfully transmit data to the gateway without depleting the energy reserves of the end-devices, and the time efficiency, which measures the amount of data that can be transmitted in a given period of time. We have validated the accuracy of the analysis by means of computer-based simulations. Results show that the overall performance is influenced by the energy harvesting rate and the amount of data to transmit from each end-device. Finally, we have compared the performance of EH-RDFSA with that of DFSA and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249276","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249276.pdf","startPage":"5985","endPage":"5991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reservation Dynamic Frame Slotted-ALOHA for wireless M2M networks with energy harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249276/","displayDocTitle":"Reservation Dynamic Frame Slotted-ALOHA for wireless M2M networks with energy harvesting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437989","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249276/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reservation Dynamic Frame Slotted-ALOHA for wireless M2M networks with energy harvesting","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570046855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094157S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249278,"authors":[{"name":"Neda Petreska","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Embedded Systems and Communication Technologies ESK"],"firstName":"Neda","lastName":"Petreska","id":"37073277300"},{"name":"Hussein Al-Zubaidy","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Al-Zubaidy","id":"38277928900"},{"name":"Rudi Knorr","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Embedded Systems and Communication Technologies ESK"],"firstName":"Rudi","lastName":"Knorr","id":"37396797800"},{"name":"James Gross","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Gross","id":"37298444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249278","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the recursive nature of end-to-end delay bound for heterogeneous wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless networks","Spread spectrum communication","Transforms","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","probability","quality of service","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive nature","heterogeneous wireless networks","multi-hop wireless networks","end-to-end quality of service","end-to-end probabilistic delay bound","underlying fading channel parameters","distributed channel gain"]}],"abstract":"Multi-hop wireless networks are increasingly becoming more relevant to current and emerging wireless network deployment. The need for understanding the performance of such networks in order to be able to provide quantifiable end-to-end quality of service is apparent. Until recently, only asymptotic results that describe the scaling of the delay in the size of the network under numerous conformity conditions were available. Recently, a new methodology for wireless networks performance analysis based on stochastic network calculus was presented [1]. This methodology enables the computation of end-to-end probabilistic delay bound of multi-hop wireless networks in terms of the underlying fading channel parameters. However, the approach assumes identically distributed channel gain which applies to a very specific class of networks. In this work, we seek to develop an end-to-end probabilistic delay bound for multi-hop wireless networks with non-identically distributed channel gains. We show that the delay bound for such networks can be computed recursively. We validate the resulting bound by means of simulation and discuss various numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249278","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249278.pdf","startPage":"5998","endPage":"6004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249278/","displayDocTitle":"On the recursive nature of end-to-end delay bound for heterogeneous wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437453","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249278/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the recursive nature of end-to-end delay bound for heterogeneous wireless networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045298S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249287,"authors":[{"name":"Dejene Boru","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Via alla Cascata 56/D, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Dejene","lastName":"Boru"},{"name":"Dzmitry Kliazovich","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Kliazovich","id":"37283713000"},{"name":"Fabrizio Granelli","affiliation":["DISI - University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Granelli","id":"37283745900"},{"name":"Pascal Bouvry","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bouvry","id":"37282633800"},{"name":"Albert Y.

Using measurements taken in an outdoor environment, it is demonstrated that for 802.11 wireless links the channel provided by corrupted frames alone (i.e. ignoring frames with PHY errors and frames received correctly) can be accurately modelled as a binary symmetric channel (BSC) provided appropriate pre- and post- processing is carried out. Also, the channel provided by corrupted frames and other frames combined can be accurately modelled as a hybrid binary symmetric/packet erasure channel. Importantly, it is found that this hybrid channel offers capacity increases of more than 100% compared to a conventional packet erasure channel over a wide range of RSSIs. This indicates that the potential exists for significant network throughput gains if the information contained in 802.11 corrupted packets is exploited.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249299/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437831","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Frames in outdoor 802.11 WLANs provide a hybrid binary-symmetric/packet-erasure channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frames in outdoor 802.11 WLANs provide a hybrid binary-symmetric/packet-erasure channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570025767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062842S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249300,"authors":[{"name":"Saud Althunibat","affiliation":["University of Trento, DISI, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Saud","lastName":"Althunibat","id":"38519389900"},{"name":"Tung Manh Vuong","affiliation":["University of Trento, DISI, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Tung Manh","lastName":"Vuong","id":"37085499196"},{"name":"Fabrizio Granelli","affiliation":["University of Trento, DISI, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Granelli","id":"37283745900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249300","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Silicon","Throughput","Noise","Minimization","Interference","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","minimisation","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","cognitive radio technology","energy resources","achievable throughput","multi-channel systems","energy detection","energy samples","variant channel conditions","throughput maximization setup","interference minimization setup","sensing energy minimization setup"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249300","abstract":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio technology consumes a significant amount of time and energy resources. Thus, it has a direct effect on the achievable throughput and consumed energy. In case of multi-channel systems, the problem becomes more effective since both the resources expenditure and the performance influence of spectrum sensing increase. Considering energy detection as the spectrum sensing method, a number of energy samples should be collected from each channel. Unlike the conventional scheme, the number of samples collected from each channel should be different due to the variant channel conditions. In this paper, the number of samples collected from each channel is optimized based on different setups, namely, throughput maximization setup, interference minimization setup, and sensing energy minimization setup.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249300","startPage":"6133","endPage":"6138","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249300.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the number of samples for multi-channel spectrum sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the number of samples for multi-channel spectrum sensing","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249300/","accessionNumber":"15437956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249300/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the number of samples for multi-channel spectrum sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570043961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049009S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7249311,"authors":[{"name":"Pouya Ghofrani","affiliation":["institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Pouya","lastName":"Ghofrani","id":"37889025900"},{"name":"Tong Wang","affiliation":["institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37596698900"},{"name":"Anke Schmeink","affiliation":["institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37391595400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249311","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks","Convergence","Mathematical model","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","AWGN channels","channel estimation","computational complexity","matrix algebra","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["set-membership affine projection channel estimation","wireless sensor network","complex matrix","additive white Gaussian noise","matrix invertibility problem","complexity reduction"]}],"abstract":"A set-membership affine projection algorithm is applied to estimate the communication channel between the wireless sensor nodes in a general form, where the channel is modeled as a complex matrix in the presence of additive white gaussian noise.

In wireless sensor networks, CB can enable low power communication by allowing a collection of sensor nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a distant fusion center in one hop. Besides the traditional CB approach where all nodes need to share and transmit the same data, a more recent technique allows each node to transmit its own data while still achieving the benefits of cooperation. However, the intricacies of varying beamforming gains in the direct sequence spread spectrum with binary frequency shift keying multiple access scheme used in this context need to be taken into account when evaluating the performance of this beamforming technique. In this paper, we take the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of this individual-data CB technique by proposing a best suited decoding scheme and analyzing its bit error rate (BER) performance over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Through analytical expressions and simulation results BER curves are drawn and the achieved performance improvement offered by the CB gain is quantified.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249316","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249316.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249316","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"6228","endPage":"6233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error rate analysis of cooperative beamforming for transmitting individual data streams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bit error rate analysis of cooperative beamforming for transmitting individual data streams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249316/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437969","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error rate analysis of cooperative beamforming for transmitting individual data streams","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05925S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249367,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Sensor nodes are battery powered devices, and hence their limited energy resources have to be optimally managed. The latest advancements in compressive sensing (CS) provide ample promise to increase WSNs lifetime by limiting the amount of measurements that have to be collected. Additional energy savings can be achieved through CS-based scheduling schemes that activate only a limited number of sensors to sense and transmit their measurements, whereas the rest are turned off. The ultimate objective is to maximize network lifetime without sacrificing network connectivity and monitoring performance. This problem can be approximated by an energy balancing approach that consists of multiple simpler subproblems, each of which corresponds to a specific time period. Then, the sensors that should be activated within a given period can be optimally derived through dynamic programming. The complexity of the proposed CS-based scheduling scheme is characterized and numerical evaluation reveals that it achieves comparable monitoring performance by activating only a fraction of the sensors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249390.pdf","startPage":"6681","endPage":"6686","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient monitoring of water distribution networks via compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Wireless sensor networks","Pipelines","Compressed sensing","Schedules","Complexity theory","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","dynamic programming","energy conservation","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling","water","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient monitoring","water distribution networks","compressive sensing","water monitoring","wireless sensor networks","energy savings","CS-based scheduling schemes","network lifetime","energy balancing approach","multiple simpler subproblems","dynamic programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient monitoring of water distribution networks via compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249390/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438285","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient monitoring of water distribution networks via compressive sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064083S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249398,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Woon Jeon","affiliation":["Andong National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Woon","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37292894500"},{"name":"Song-Nam Hong","affiliation":["Andong National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Song-Nam","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085359269"},{"name":"Mingyue Ji","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Lab., CA"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Ji","id":"38580848200"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["University of Southern California, CA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37085369313"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249398","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"abstract":"We consider a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network in which the nodes are uniformly distributed at random over the network area and can cache information from a library of possible messages (files).

Under the classical \u201cprotocol model\u201d of wireless ad hoc networks, we characterize the optimal throughput scaling law by presenting a feasible scheme formed by a decentralized caching policy for the parameter regimes of interest and a local multihop transmission protocol. The scaling law optimality of the proposed strategy is shown by deriving a new throughput upper bound. Surprisingly, we show that decentralized uniform random caching yields optimal scaling in most of the system interesting regimes. We also observe that caching improves the throughput scaling law of classical ad hoc networks, and that multihop improves the previously derived scaling law of caching wireless networks under one-hop transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249398.pdf","startPage":"6732","endPage":"6737","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching in wireless multihop device-to-device networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Ad hoc networks","Protocols","Wireless communication","Spread spectrum communication","Libraries","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","protocols","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless device-to-device network","wireless D2D network","library","popularity distribution","requested file","local cache","protocol model","wireless ad hoc networks","optimal throughput scaling law","decentralized caching policy","parameter regimes of interest","local multihop transmission protocol","scaling law optimality","throughput upper bound","decentralized uniform random caching","one-hop transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["caching","multihop D2D networks","scaling laws"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Caching in wireless multihop device-to-device networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249398/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437715","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching in wireless multihop device-to-device networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249429,"authors":[{"name":"Khitem Ben Ali","affiliation":["LETI laboratory, University of Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Khitem Ben","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085645880"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

Unlike previous work, our proposed scheme distributes the FEC encoded bit streams to multiple spatial channels so that additional diversity gains can be obtained. Due to the complexity of the optimization, we decompose the original problem into several sub-problems, which can then be solved by a heuristic algorithm. The optimal solution can be found by choosing the best among all the candidate solutions obtained from the sub-problems. The effectiveness and superb performance of our proposed scheme can be demonstrated by many simulations with different videos and channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoE-driven FEC rate adaptation scheme for scalable video transmissions over MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249434","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249434.pdf","startPage":"6953","endPage":"6958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A QoE-driven FEC rate adaptation scheme for scalable video transmissions over MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249434/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438103","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoE-driven FEC rate adaptation scheme for scalable video transmissions over MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080299S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249453,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Victoria, Australia"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38467633200"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Victoria, Australia","School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, P.

Meanwhile, due to the popularity of Twitter, it also becomes a main target for spamming activities. In order to stop spammers, Twitter is using Google SafeBrowsing to detect and block spam links. Despite that blacklists can block malicious URLs embedded in tweets, their lagging time hinders the ability to protect users in real-time. Thus, researchers begin to apply different machine learning algorithms to detect Twitter spam. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation on each algorithms' performance for real-time Twitter spam detection due to the lack of large groundtruth. To carry out a thorough evaluation, we collected a large dataset of over 600 million public tweets. We further labelled around 6.5 million spam tweets and extracted 12 light-weight features, which can be used for online detection. In addition, we have conducted a number of experiments on six machine learning algorithms under various conditions to better understand their effectiveness and weakness for timely Twitter spam detection. We will make our labelled dataset for researchers who are interested in validating or extending our work.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249453.pdf","startPage":"7065","endPage":"7070","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"6 million spam tweets: A large ground truth for timely Twitter spam detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Chaos","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","social networking (online)","unsolicited e-mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Twitter spam detection","spam Tweets","Google SafeBrowsing","online social networks","machine learning algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"6 million spam tweets: A large ground truth for timely Twitter spam detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249453/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437475","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"6 million spam tweets: A large ground truth for timely Twitter spam detection","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073425S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249468,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Xiamen Univ., China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37579297100"},{"name":"Jinliang Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Xiamen Univ., China"],"firstName":"Jinliang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085390809"},{"name":"Qiangda Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering, Xiamen Univ., China"],"firstName":"Qiangda","lastName":"Li","id":"37085421087"},{"name":"H.

However, due to the distributed and potentially selfish nature of smartphone users, mobile crowdsensing applications are vulnerable to faked sensing attacks by users who bid a low price in an MCS auction and provide faked sensing reports to save sensing costs and avoid privacy leakage. In this paper, the interactions among an MCS server and smartphone users are formulated as a mobile crowdsensing game, in which each smartphone user chooses its sensing strategy such as its sensing time and energy to maximize its expected utility while the MCS server classifies the received sensing reports and determines the payment strategy accordingly to stimulate users to provide accurate sensing reports. Nash equilibrium (NE) of a static MCS game is evaluated and a closed-form expression for the NE in a special case is presented. Moreover, a dynamic mobile crowdsensing game is investigated, in which the sensing parameters of a smartphone are unknown by the server and the other users. A Q-learning discriminated pricing strategy is developed for the server to determine the payment to each user. Simulation results show that the proposed pricing mechanism stimulates users to provide high-quality sensing services and suppress faked sensing attacks.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249468","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249468.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249468","startPage":"7157","endPage":"7162","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure mobile crowdsensing game","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15438115","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure mobile crowdsensing game","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570046961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058739S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7249476,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our simulation results demonstrate that the use of jammer helps trade between secure rate and fairness performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249486","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7263","endPage":"7268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jammer assisted sum rate and fairness improvement in secure OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Jammer assisted sum rate and fairness improvement in secure OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249486/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437588","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249486/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jammer assisted sum rate and fairness improvement in secure OFDMA","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075281S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249487,"authors":[{"name":"Qingqi Pei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Qingqi","lastName":"Pei","id":"37294380000"},{"name":"Lichuan Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Lichuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085652751"},{"name":"Hongning Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Hongning","lastName":"Li","id":"38009785600"},{"name":"Zi Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Zi","lastName":"Li","id":"37076925500"},{"name":"Dingyu Yan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Dingyu","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085644435"},{"name":"Zhao Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Networks Services, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Li","id":"37597745900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249487","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Sensors","Games","Databases","Information systems","Security","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","game theory","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","reputation-based coalitional games","spectrum allocation method","coalition formation game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","coalitional games","spectrum allocation","trust value"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) technique is proved to be an efficient approach for mitigating the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless communications and spectrum allocation methods construct the foundation of such a technique. However, it will degrade the performance of CR when paying no attention to the behavior of second users (SUs) and their demands for spectrum attribute. In this paper, the spectrum allocation problem is first modeled as a coalition formation game, taking SUs reputation and requirements of spectrums into consideration. The rule named Assigning spectrum by probability among coalitions and by demand within coalitions is used to optimize the spectrum utilization and fairness when allocating spectrum among SUs. For each SU is equipped with an agent, a central authority is not needed and therefore the scheme can be more applicable in dynamic cognitive radio networks. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can efficiently improve the fairness and efficiency of spectrum allocation in CR context.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249487","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249487.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249487","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"7269","endPage":"7274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reputation-based coalitional games for spectrum allocation in distributed Cognitive Radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reputation-based coalitional games for spectrum allocation in distributed Cognitive Radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249487/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437435","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reputation-based coalitional games for spectrum allocation in distributed Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092929S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249495,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Kasiri","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Kasiri","id":"37396911300"},{"name":"Ioannis Lambadaris","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Lambadaris","id":"37269823000"},{"name":"Fei Richard Yu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Fei Richard","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279171400"},{"name":"Helen Tang","affiliation":["Defence R&D Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289160500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249495","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Privacy","Games","Channel allocation","Signal to noise ratio","Bismuth","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cooperative communication","data privacy","game theory","mobile ad hoc networks","signal detection","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preserving spectrum sensing","distributed cooperative spectrum sensing","multichannel cognitive radio","MANET","location privacy preservation","signal-to-noise ratio random manipulation","coalitional game theory","distributed channel assignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy preservation","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","mobile ad hoc networks"]}],"abstract":"Location privacy preservation in multi-channel cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks (CR-MANETs) is a challenging issue, where the network does not rely on a trusted central entity to impose privacy-preserving protocols.

In this paper, location privacy is studied for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in multi-channel CR-MANETs.We first quantify the location privacy. Then, we propose a new privacy-preserving distributed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for multi-channel CR-MANETs. We design a new anonymization method based on random manipulation of the exchanged signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Afterwards, a coalitional game-theoretic distributed channel assignment is proposed to maximize location privacy and sensing performance over each channel in the network.

Zero forcing (ZF) processing is utilized at various locations to improve the capacity when the eavesdropper is equipped with a single antenna. The impact of the proposed ZF-based technique on the secrecy capacity is investigated for three different scenarios depending on where the ZF is applied, namely, 1) ZF at the relay and destination, 2) ZF at the source and relay, 3) ZF at the relay. For these configurations, analytical expressions for the ergodic-secrecy capacity are derived, and simulation results are provided throughout the paper to validate our analysis. Results reveal that reducing the number of source and/or destination antennas will enhance the ergodic-secrecy capacity and the significance of this enhancement is dependent on the particular scenario adopted. Furthermore, it will be shown that, in general, secrecy capacity improves with increasing the relay power.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249501.pdf","startPage":"7353","endPage":"7358","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249501","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249501","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249501","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Interference","Relay networks (telecommunications)","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel capacity","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy capacity","two hop AF relay networks","zero forcing","MIMO half duplex amplify-and-forward relay network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AF relay","MIMO","physical layer security","secrecy capacity","zero forcing (ZF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249501/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of secrecy capacity for two hop AF relay networks with zero forcing","accessionNumber":"15437500","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249501/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of secrecy capacity for two hop AF relay networks with zero forcing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071051S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249503,"authors":[{"name":"Elham Nosrati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Nosrati","id":"38232681600"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"},{"name":"Arash Khabbazibasmenj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Khabbazibasmenj","id":"37400208100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249503","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Capacity planning","Security","Receivers","Fading","Transmitters","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy capacity enhancement","two-hop relaying","eavesdropper","random phase shifting","modulated data symbols","dual-hop decode and forward relaying","communication signal wiretapping","energy efficient communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-hop relaying","secrecy capacity","decode-and-forward"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249503","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249503.pdf","startPage":"7365","endPage":"7369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy capacity enhancement in two-hop DF relaying systems in the presence of eavesdropper","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a random phase shifting scheme applied to modulated data symbols of a dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system to enhance its secrecy capacity in the presence of an eavesdropper, which can wiretap the communication signals of both hops.

The proposed system exploits the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) widely used in compressive sensing to encrypt the data. Because the channels at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper are inherently different, the corresponding sensing matrices are different. Thus the eavesdropper cannot decode the data successfully. More specifically, when full channel state information (CSI) at the legitimate receiver is known to the transmitter, the proposed precoder can simultaneously maximize receive SNR and attain secrecy. Simulation results corroborate theoretical results, and show that the proposed system enjoys different advantages when different recovery algorithms are used.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249506","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249506.pdf","startPage":"7383","endPage":"7387","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure MIMO transmission via compressive sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure MIMO transmission via compressive sensing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437510","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249506/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure MIMO transmission via compressive sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570035997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068567S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249511,"authors":[{"name":"Nedasadat Hosseinidehaj","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Nedasadat","lastName":"Hosseinidehaj","id":"37085740213"},{"name":"Robert Malaney","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Malaney","id":"37282041100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249511","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Fading","Satellites","Quantum entanglement","Uplink","Noise","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","atmospheric turbulence","communication complexity","fading channels","quantum communication","quantum cryptography","quantum entanglement","radio transceivers","satellite ground stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined atmospheric fading channel","quantum communication scheme","entanglement-based continuous variable quantum key distribution","ground station","turbulence induced beam","engineering complexity","ground transceiver","reflector","quantum key generation rate","continuous variable quantum key rate","reflection off low-earth-orbit satellite"]}],"abstract":"In this work we analyze a quantum communication scheme for entanglement-based continuous variable quantum key distribution between two ground stations.

Thus, data owners usually encrypt their data before outsourcing them to the cloud server for security and privacy concerns. At the same time, very often users need to find data for specific keywords of interest to them. This motivates the research on the searchable encryption technique, which allows the search user to search over the encrypted data. Many mechanisms have been proposed, and are mainly focusing on the symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) technique. However, they do not consider the search authorization problem that requires the cloud server only to return the search results to authorized users. In this paper, we propose an authorized and ranked multi-keyword search scheme (ARMS) over encrypted cloud data by leveraging the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and SSE techniques. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed ARMS scheme can achieve confidentiality of documents, trapdoor unlinkability and collusion resistance. Extensive experiments show that the ARMS is more superior and efficient than existing approaches in terms of functionalities and computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249517","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7450","endPage":"7455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving authorized and ranked multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achieving authorized and ranked multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249517/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437962","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249517/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving authorized and ranked multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060104S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":7249519,"authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Zhang","affiliation":["Departmcnt of Computer Science and Operations Research, University of Montreal, Canada","School of Electric Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, P.

In this paper, a novel database-augmented spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed for a secondary access to the TV White Space (TVWS) spectrum. The proposed database-augmented sensing algorithm is based on an existing geo-location database approach for detecting incumbents like Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE) users, but is combined with spectrum sensing to further improve the protection to these primary users (PUs). A closed-form expression of secondary users' (SUs) spectral efficiency is also derived for its opportunistic access of TVWS. By implementing previously developed power control based geo-location database and adaptive spectrum sensing algorithm, the proposed database-augmented sensing algorithm demonstrates a better spectrum efficiency for SUs, and better protection for incumbent PUs than the exiting stand-alone geo-location database model. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the unregistered PMSE on the reliable use of the channel for SUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249520/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15437590","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249520/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Database-augmented spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database-augmented spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048138S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249523,"authors":[{"name":"Deborah Cohen","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Cohen","id":"38237615800"},{"name":"Alon Akiva","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Alon","lastName":"Akiva","id":"37085671693"},{"name":"Barak Avraham","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Barak","lastName":"Avraham","id":"37085671809"},{"name":"Yonina C.

Sub-Nyquist sampling has been considered for this task in order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck of the wideband signals a CR usually deals with, by exploiting their multiband structure. However, communication signals suffer from fading and shadowing effects that affect a single CR's performance. In this paper, we consider collaborative spectrum sensing by a network of CRs, each sharing an observation matrix derived from sub-Nyquist samples of their respective received signal with a fusion center. Exploiting the fact that all received signals share a joint support, equal to that of the transmitted signal, the fusion center recovers it by combining the measurements of the different CRs. We present two joint reconstruction algorithms, Block Sparse Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BSOMP) and Block Sparse Simultaneous Iterative Hard Thresholding (BSIHT), that adapt the original OMP and IHT to both block sparse and matrix (simultaneous) inputs. Simulations show that our algorithms outperform a collaborative scheme based on hard decisions, namely the union of the supports recovered by each CR individually, demonstrating that cooperation between CRs via measurement fusion improve their performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7486","endPage":"7491","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249523.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249523/","displayDocTitle":"Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437784","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570040813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073893S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249524,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Abu Alkheir","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ala Abu","lastName":"Alkheir","id":"38246674600"},{"name":"Hussein T.

Computer simulations are used to show the advantages of the proposed strategies compared to the conventional decision-based cooperative spectrum sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438012","htmlLink":"/document/7249524/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for RF-energy harvesting cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for RF-energy harvesting cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053438S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249526,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Lv","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085388324"},{"name":"Han Qian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085399335"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Fengye Hu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Fengye","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277800700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249526","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Probability","Simulation","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antenna based sensing and recognition","primary user","multiple transmit power levels","spectrum sensing problem","cognitive radio network","secondary user","channel information","multiple primary transmit power"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple antenna based sensing and recognition when primary user has multiple transmit power levels","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","endPage":"7508","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249526","startPage":"7504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249526","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the multiple antenna based spectrum sensing problem for a cognitive radio (CR) network.

We identify the causes that i) degrade node outreach even with increasing deployment density under the SINR model and ii) lead to duplicate transmissions under the Boolean model. Further performance degradation occurs due to the additional constraints imposed by the primary users in such networks. To increase node outreach in interference-limited cognitive radio networks, we propose a modified version of probabilistic flooding that uses lower message overhead without compromising network connectivity. This is achieved by having just enough number of neighbors of a node to rebroadcast to others. The subset of neighbors that are selected to broadcast is decided on the number of neighbor a nodes has, their spatial orientation with respect to each other, and the interference they might cause. Identification of such subsets reduce duplicate retransmissions which in turn reduces interference. We use a localized clustering technique in conjunction with the concept of critical density from percolation theory such that each node decides its own rebroadcasting probability in a distributed manner. Through simulations, we compare the proposed technique with flooding and probabilistic flooding. Results validated that, the proposed technique reduces number of rebroadcasts and increases node outreach both under SINR and Boolean models.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249531/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15438037","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249531/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NAPF: Percolation driven probabilistic flooding for interference limited cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NAPF: Percolation driven probabilistic flooding for interference limited cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570034801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109735S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249532,"authors":[{"name":"Yasir Al-Mathehaji","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle, Upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Al-Mathehaji","id":"37085662028"},{"name":"Said Boussakta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle, Upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Boussakta","id":"37271881700"},{"name":"Martin Johnston","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle, Upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37274107100"},{"name":"Harith Fakhrey","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle, Upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Harith","lastName":"Fakhrey","id":"37085677016"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249532","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Protocols","Network topology","Sensors","Bipartite graph","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","graph theory","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio ad hoc networks","distributed reliable cognitive radio broadcast protocol","CRBP","reliable data dissemination","joint transmitter-receiver channel selection","primary user communication protection","local topology","network topology","spectrum observations","bipartite graph","spectrum information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRBP","Cognitive radio ad hoc networks","Distributed broadcast","Data dissemination","Bipartite graph"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables unlicensed users to opportunistically use the vacant spectrum bands assigned to licensed users, thereby enhancing the spectrum utilization. In the last decade, Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have been well studied and many important works have been proposed. However, the broadcast problem, which is one of the most fundamental operations in CRNs, has not been well studied. In this paper, a distributed reliable Cognitive Radio Broadcast Protocol (CRBP) for cognitive radio ad hoc networks is proposed that makes the following contributions: (i) reliable data dissemination, (ii) joint transmitter-receiver channel selection, (iii) protection of primary users' communication and (iv) coordinating the broadcast process without the need for a common channel. A key novelty of the proposed CRBP is the formulation of the broadcast problem from the viewpoint of connecting different local topologies, which is a unique feature in cognitive radio networks. We jointly map the network topologies and the spectrum observations as a bipartite graph which allows the channel selection undertaken at each node to capture the spectrum information and the environmental topologies of all the neighbouring nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249532","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249532.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249532","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"7540","endPage":"7545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRBP: A broadcast protocol for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"CRBP: A broadcast protocol for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249532/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437468","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRBP: A broadcast protocol for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122383S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249533,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Hu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, P.R.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where a secondary user provides effort to the primary user to win the competition from many secondary users and simultaneously achieves optimal throughput. We establish a novel cooperation scheme termed Low Price to Win (LPW), and abstract the cooperation problem in CRNs as an optimization problem with multiple constraints. Unlike some traditional methods that provide direct solutions, we design a novel greedy algorithm using the Lyapunov optimization technique, by which the sophisticated optimization problem can be divided into a few subproblems and then cross-layer optimization can be applied.

However, this proposal suffers from two major problems that may significantly decrease the system performance: (1) collision among the secondary users (SUs) can hardly be detected, thus leading to the secondary transmission failures, and (2) SUs cannot abort transmission when collision occurs, making the long collision duration possible. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive MAC protocol for efficient DSA based on full-duplex CRNs (FD-CRNs), where SUs are able to perform simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission owing to full-duplex techniques. Specifically, SUs can detect the collision during transmission, so as to reduce the collision time and improve secondary network performance. Analytical results include the derivations of key design parameters such as the collision ratio with the PU, spectrum usage ratio, optimal contention window size, and the performance comparisons with the conventional DSA in half-duplex CRNs (HD-CRNs), which are further confirmed by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized dynamic spectrum access in full-duplex cognitive radio networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249534","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249534.pdf","startPage":"7552","endPage":"7557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized dynamic spectrum access in full-duplex cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249534/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437528","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized dynamic spectrum access in full-duplex cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086267S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249535,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Huang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38266787300"},{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Zan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279082100"},{"name":"Jiangbo Si","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Jiangbo","lastName":"Si","id":"37402423800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249535","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity reception","Interference","Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","power control","radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication control","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisource multirelay underlay cognitive radio networks","multiple primary users","outage behavior","dual hop cognitive radio network","cooperative cognitive radio network","multiple primary transmitters","multiple primary receivers","outage constraints","adaptive power control","cooperative diversity","multiuser diversity","secondary source-relay pair","outage probability","reactive decode-and-forward relaying","maximum ratio combining","selection combining","Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"abstract":"The outage behavior of a dual-hop multi-source multi-relay cooperative underlay cognitive radio network is investigated in the presence of multiple primary transmitters and multiple primary receivers. Firstly, with primary users' (PUs') outage constraints, an adaptive power control scheme is adopted to obtain maximum allowed secondary transmission power. Then, an SINR-based scheme is proposed for the combined use of cooperative diversity and multiuser diversity, where the best secondary source-relay pair is selected to communicate with the secondary destination. In this context, exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability of reactive decode-and-forward (DF) relaying are derived for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) over Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. In particular, we consider the dependence among the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the destination caused by multiple PUs. It is shown that although there exists outage floor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, increasing the number of secondary sources or available relays are efficient ways to decrease the outage floor.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249535","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249535.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249535","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"7558","endPage":"7563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-source multi-relay underlay cognitive radio networks with multiple primary users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-source multi-relay underlay cognitive radio networks with multiple primary users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249535/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249535/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437576","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-source multi-relay underlay cognitive radio networks with multiple primary users","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073611S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249536,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In our framework, a primary base station (PBS), acted as the spectrum auctioneer, leases its under-utilized channels to secondary users (SUs) who request and access spectrum on the fly. Different from most of existing works in online spectrum allocation, we focus on a more practical situation that the auctioneer (or the PBS) has no prior knowledge of PUs' activities so that its channel states are not static. In order to balance the auction profits from granted SUs' spectrum requests and the potential penalties caused by incomplete services to PUs, we introduce the idea of virtual spectrum sellers and formulate the problem as an online double spectrum auction. We then propose a novel online admission and pricing mechanism which also considers the reusability of wireless spectrum. Theoretical analyses are provided to prove that our auction algorithm satisfies all desired economic properties in terms of budget-balance, individual rationality and truthfulness. Simulation results show that our proposed auction algorithm can increase the utility of the PBS, enhance spectrum utilization and achieve better satisfaction for SUs compared to counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249538/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15437478","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249538/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Online spectrum auction in cognitive radio networks with uncertain activities of primary users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online spectrum auction in cognitive radio networks with uncertain activities of primary users","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570039905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077932S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249542,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Monemi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Neyriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Monemi","id":"38666645800"},{"name":"Mehdi Rasti","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Rasti","id":"37683692900"},{"name":"Ekram Hossain","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Ekram","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37085364984"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249542","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Quality of service","Aggregates","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underlay cognitive radio networks","feasible interference region","primary users","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios","secondary users","primary receiving-points","feasible cognitive interference region","interference management","interference temperature limit","FCIR polyhedron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","feasible cognitive interference region (FCIR)","power and admission control","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) assignment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249542","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249542.pdf","startPage":"7603","endPage":"7608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing feasible interference region for underlay cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN), in order to guarantee protection of primary users (PUs) (i.e., all PUs achieve their target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios [SINRs]), the interference caused by all secondary users (SUs) to the primary receiving-points should be controlled. To do so, the feasible cognitive interference region (FCIR), i.e., the region for allowable values of interference at all of the primary receiving-points, which guarantee protecting the PUs, needs to be formally characterized. In the state-of-the-art interference management schemes for underlay CRNs, it is considered that all PUs are protected if the cognitive interference for each primary receiving-point is lower than a maximum threshold, the so called interference temperature limit (ITL) for the corresponding receiving-point. This is assumed to be fixed and independent of ITL values for other primary receiving-points. This corresponds to a box-like FCIR, which is not correct. In this paper, we analytically obtain the FCIR and show that, the FCIR is a polyhedron (i.e., the maximum feasible cognitive interference threshold for each primary receiving-point is not constant, and it depends on that for other primary receiving-points). Therefore, in practical interference management algorithms, it is not proper to consider a constant and independent ITL value for each of the primary receiving-points. This finding would significantly affect the design of practical interference management schemes for CRNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249542/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15437454","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249542/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing feasible interference region for underlay cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing feasible interference region for underlay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570050559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061918S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249543,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Li","id":"37085669631"},{"name":"Tao Jing","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jing","id":"37285468000"},{"name":"Xiuzhen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Xiuzhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37273146300"},{"name":"Yan Huo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Huo","id":"38244554200"},{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37077455700"},{"name":"Dechang Chen","affiliation":["Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dechang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37274185100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249543","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Interference","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","jamming","MIMO communication","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO cooperative cognitive radio network","secure communication","multiple input multiple output CCRN","spectrum efficiency improvement","secondary user","multiple antennas","cooperative relay network","primary user","secondary traffic","wiretapping opportunity","physical layer","legitimate receiver","beamformer design","power allocation vector","secrecy capacity maximization","cooperative jamming scheme","PHY layer security"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks (MIMO-CCRNs) have been proposed recently to further improve the spectrum efficiency. In MIMO-CCRNs, secondary users (SUs) equipped with multiple antennas can cooperatively relay the primary signals for the primary users (PUs) while concurrently accessing the same spectrum to send the secondary traffic for themselves. This communication model is intrinsically vulnerable to eavesdropping as more wiretapping opportunities can be exploited by attackers. In this paper, we propose to employ cooperative jamming at physical (PHY) layer to achieve secure transmissions. In cooperative jamming, certain SUs are employed as helpers to send jamming signals to jam the eavesdropper without interfering the legitimate receivers. We optimize the design of the beamformers (including the information beamformer and the jamming beamformer) as well as the power allocation vector to maximize the secrecy capacity in two scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the secrecy capacity is remarkably enhanced in our cooperative jamming scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to investigate the PHY layer security issue for MIMO-CCRNs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative jamming for secure communications in MIMO Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249543","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249543.pdf","startPage":"7609","endPage":"7614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative jamming for secure communications in MIMO Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249543/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437675","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative jamming for secure communications in MIMO Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570034001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065129S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249544,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Nanjing Univ. of Posts and Telecom., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Xu","id":"37694363300"},{"name":"Qun Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Nanjing Univ. of Posts and Telecom., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085538555"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249544","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Propagation losses","Cognitive radio","Channel state information","Simulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form optimal power allocation strategy","cognitive radio networks","primary user secrecy rate loss constraint","malicious eavesdropper","confidential messages","SU maximum transmit power constraint","secondary users","PU secrecy level improvement","transmission rate maximization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for cognitive radio networks with primary user secrecy rate loss constraint","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","endPage":"7621","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249544","startPage":"7615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249544","abstract":"This paper considers a cognitive radio (CR) network in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper who attempts to receive confidential messages from a pair of primary users (PUs).

Our results indicate that the PU secrecy rate improves significantly with the help of the SU transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437690","htmlLink":"/document/7249544/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for cognitive radio networks with primary user secrecy rate loss constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for cognitive radio networks with primary user secrecy rate loss constraint","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570037673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058238S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249546,"authors":[{"name":"Lokman Sboui","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Lokman","lastName":"Sboui","id":"38234483900"},{"name":"Hakim Ghazzai","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hakim","lastName":"Ghazzai","id":"38577935800"},{"name":"Zouheir Rezki","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Rezki","id":"37294101200"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249546","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Cognitive radio","Antennas","MIMO","Resource management","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way relaying achievable rate","two-way relaying cognitive radio","space alignment","multiple antenna two-way relaying","spectrum sharing system","interference avoidance","optimal power allocation","total power budget"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO space alignment","cognitive radio","two-way relaying","amplify-and-forward relay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249546","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249546","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"We study a multiple-antenna two-way relaying (TWR) spectrum sharing system.

It is assumed that the CRN is subject to Nakagami-m fading. Secondary users are allowed to utilize the licensed radio spectrum of the primary users through underlay spectrum access. A finite buffer at the secondary transmitter is partitioned into two regions, the first region serves both classes of packets while the second region serves only packets of the highest priority class. Therefore, the examined CRN can be modeled as an M/G/1/K queueing system using partial buffer sharing. An embedded Markov chain is applied to analyze the queueing behavior of the system. Utilizing the balance equations and the normalized equation, the equilibrium state distribution of the system at an arbitrary time instant can be found. This outcome is utilized to investigate the impact of queue length, arrival rates, and fading parameters on queueing performance measures such as blocking probability, throughput, mean packet transmission time, channel utilization, mean number of packets in the system, and mean packet waiting time for each class of packets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15437266","htmlLink":"/document/7249549/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Packet loss priority of cognitive radio networks with partial buffer sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet loss priority of cognitive radio networks with partial buffer sharing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570025743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089866S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249550,"authors":[{"name":"Junhui Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junhui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38486693200"},{"name":"Jiao Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085732638"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249550","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Bandwidth","Resource management","Bismuth","Interference","Optimization","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cognitive radio","optimisation","quality of service","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimization algorithm","cognitive radio network","centralized spectrum sharing","primary users","computational complexity","low complexity suboptimal power allocation algorithm","bandwidth allocation","QoS","cognitive users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","joint optimization","multiple levels","power allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249550","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249550","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"In this paper, a joint optimization algorithm for cognitive radio (CR) network based on centralized spectrum sharing is proposed.

In the SN, two secondary transceivers adopt multiple access broadcast protocol for the secondary data transmission and at each bidirectional relay, there exist two buffers of size L data elements. Hence, each relay can store the incoming secondary data and retransmit it in an appropriate time slot later. We propose a novel buffer-aided bidirectional relay selection policy with secondary power minimization and successive interference cancellation in which the interference between the PN and SN is eliminated. Since buffers are used at the relays, data transmission in the SN is not limited to a predefined schedule. Hence, at each time slot, based on the instantaneous buffer state information of the relays and the instantaneous or statistical channel state information of the involved links, the SN makes a decision. The SN decides optimally when to use one of the relays for the multiple access, use one of the relays for the broadcast mode or be silent provided that the data transmission in both the PN and SN are error free and the secondary power expenditure is minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme minimizes the secondary power expenditure, and achieves up to 40% improvement in the secondary throughput for 6 middle relays compared to the other recently proposed policies without buffer.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249555","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249555","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"7683","endPage":"7688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer-aided relay selection and secondary power minimization for two-way cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-aided relay selection and secondary power minimization for two-way cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249555/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437508","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-aided relay selection and secondary power minimization for two-way cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570038019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06238S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249556,"authors":[{"name":"Valentin Rakovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, SS.

However, applying radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) in a cognitive radio system could potentially circumvent this tradeoff, resulting in a secondary system with limitless power supply and meaningful achievable information rates. This paper proposes an online solution for the optimal time allocation (time sharing) between the EH phase and the information transmission (IT) phase in an underlay cognitive radio system, which harvests the RF energy originating from the primary system. The proposed online solution maximizes the average achievable rate of the cognitive radio system, subject to the \u03b5-percentile protection criteria for the primary system. The optimal time sharing achieves significant gains compared to equal time allocation between the EH and IT phases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438205","htmlLink":"/document/7249556/","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal time sharing in underlay cognitive radio systems with RF energy harvesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal time sharing in underlay cognitive radio systems with RF energy harvesting","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570041813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049177S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7249558,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Kaushik","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Kaushik","id":"37085391602"},{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Shree Krishna","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38489086200"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"},{"name":"Friedrich Jondral","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Jondral","id":"37270652500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249558","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Accuracy","Estimation","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","power control","radio links","radio transmitters","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation-throughput tradeoff","underlay cognitive radio system","dynamic spectrum access","secondary transmitter","ST","power control mechanism","primary receiver","PR","pilot channel transmission","channel estimation","secondary link"]}],"abstract":"Understanding the performance of cognitive radio systems is of great interest. To perform dynamic spectrum access, different paradigms are conceptualized in the literature. Of these, Underlay System (US) has caught much attention in the recent past. According to US, a power control mechanism is employed at the Secondary Transmitter (ST) to constrain the interference at the Primary Receiver (PR) below a certain threshold. However, it requires the knowledge of channel towards PR at the ST. This knowledge can be obtained by estimating the received power, assuming a beacon or a pilot channel transmission by the PR. This estimation is never perfect, hence the induced error may distort the true performance of the US. Motivated by this fact, we propose a novel model that captures the effect of channel estimation errors on the performance of the system. More specifically, we characterize the performance of the US in terms of the estimation-throughput tradeoff. Furthermore, we determine the maximum achievable throughput for the secondary link. Based on numerical analysis, it is shown that the conventional model overestimates the performance of the US.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249558","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249558.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249558","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","startPage":"7701","endPage":"7706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation-throughput tradeoff for Underlay cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Estimation-throughput tradeoff for Underlay cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249558/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7249558/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437240","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation-throughput tradeoff for Underlay cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570047569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070634S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249559,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Network Computing and Information System, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085346660"},{"name":"Shuyu Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA","National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuyu","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085621630"},{"name":"Kaigui Bian","affiliation":["Institute of Network Computing and Information System, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaigui","lastName":"Bian","id":"37296444800"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085619797"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249559","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Clocks","Schedules","Cognitive radio","Synchronization","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","protocols","telecommunication scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio rendezvous network","average-maximum TTR trade-off optimization","rendezvous delay","channel hopping rendezvous protocol design","neighbor discovery problem","wake-up schedule","rendezvous diversity","time-to-rendezvous"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249559","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249559","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) networks, \u201cTTR\u201d, a.k.a. time-to-rendezvous, is one of the most important metrics for evaluating the performance of a channel hopping (CH) rendezvous protocol, and it characterizes the rendezvous delay when two CRs perform channel hopping. There exists a trade-off of optimizing the average or maximum TTR in the CH rendezvous protocol design. On one hand, the random CH protocol leads to the best \u201caverage\u201d TTR without ensuring a finite \u201cmaximum\u201d TTR (two CRs may never rendezvous in the worst case), or a high rendezvous diversity (multiple rendezvous channels). On the other hand, many sequence-based CH protocols ensure a finite maximum TTR (upper bound of TTR) and a high rendezvous diversity, while they inevitably yield a larger average TTR. In this paper, we strike a balance in the average-maximum TTR trade-off for CR rendezvous by leveraging the advantages of both random and sequence-based CH protocols. Inspired by the neighbor discovery problem, we establish a design framework of creating a wake-up schedule whereby every CR follows the sequence-based (or random) CH protocol in the awake (or asleep) mode. Analytical and simulation results show that the hybrid CH protocols under this framework are able to achieve a greatly improved average TTR as well as a low upper-bound of TTR, without sacrificing the rendezvous diversity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7707","endPage":"7712","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249559.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing average-maximum TTR trade-off for cognitive radio rendezvous","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249559/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing average-maximum TTR trade-off for cognitive radio rendezvous","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437943","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing average-maximum TTR trade-off for cognitive radio rendezvous","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570048113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068573S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249560,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085483571"},{"name":"Hongxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky"],"firstName":"Hongxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37600675300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6432-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6431-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"7249560","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Message systems","Interference","Convergence","Radio frequency","Energy efficiency","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","MIMO communication","optimisation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO cognitive radio network","distributed energy efficiency optimization algorithm","centralized energy efficiency optimization algorithm","nonconvex problems","Dinkelbach method","parametric problem","optimal solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","cognitive radio","energy efficiency","fractional programming","transmission beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio and MIMO have drawn significant attention to achieve high spectrum utilization efficiency.

Finally, simulation results confirm the correctness of our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249564","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249564.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7737","endPage":"7742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser scheduling for cognitive MIMO with channel estimation errors and feedback delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser scheduling for cognitive MIMO with channel estimation errors and feedback delay","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249564/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437695","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249564/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser scheduling for cognitive MIMO with channel estimation errors and feedback delay","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570049449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104081S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7249566,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Our novel solution incorporates the probabilities of channel availability obtained through spectrum sensing for allocating power and subcarrier in a multi-user multi-band environment. In order to protect the licensed users from harmful intervention under imperfect sensing information, stochastic transmit and interference power constraints are imposed on the CRs. The performance of the proposed RRA algorithm and advantages over the conventional hard-decision-based approaches are demonstrated via simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2015.7249566","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225357/7248285/07249566.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248285","startPage":"7750","endPage":"7755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic resource allocation for hybrid spectrum access OFDMA-based cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7249566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic resource allocation for hybrid spectrum access OFDMA-based cognitive radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7249566/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15437750","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7249566/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic resource allocation for hybrid spectrum access OFDMA-based cognitive radios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1570051443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062051S","chronDate":"8-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225357","isNumber":"7248285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7248285","articleId":"7249566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"}]
