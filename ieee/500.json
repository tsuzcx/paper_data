An examination of the characteristics of present and future generation GaAs integrated circuits indicates that they will emphasize moderate on-chip gate counts and high gate speeds. Complete advantage can be taken of GaAs digital technology only if traditional signal processor architectures are completely recast at the memory layout, logic design, arithmetic implementation, and system architecture levels, and if these issues are considered in combination with system, logic board, and chip layout and packaging constraints in a single integrated approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit technology","Signal processing","Logic design","Digital integrated circuits","Signal design","Process planning","Technology planning","Character generation","Gallium Arsenide"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5005468","doi":"10.1109/MAES.1987.5005468","startPage":"30","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/62/5005450/05005468.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5005450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.1987.5005468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5005468/","displayDocTitle":"The Need for a Wholistic Design Approach when using Gallium Arsenide Technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","volume":"2","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Need for a Wholistic Design Approach when using Gallium Arsenide Technology","sourcePdf":"AES-M-v2-n8-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056632S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"5005450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","articleId":"5005468","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5005573,"authors":[{"name":"Larry N.

In this time, roughly 20 machines have been built and tested specifically for such purposes as simulation, design rule checking, placement, and routing. Their uses are increasing, and the machines are becoming commercially available. This survey describes not only the machines but also their problems and limitations. It also gives comparative data on speed-up techniques and performance. Examples include a simulation machine that achieves roughly a million-times speed-up over a conventional 1-MIP mainframe and a very low cost machine for design rule checking that provides a 100-times improvement. These and other examples clearly demonstrate the viability of special-purpose engines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Hardware Accelerators Used in Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/MDT.1984.5005647","startPage":"21","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.1984.5005647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5005631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/5005631/05005647.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5005647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5005647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1984","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Hardware Accelerators Used in Computer-Aided Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Hardware Accelerators Used in Computer-Aided Design","sourcePdf":"DT-M-v1-n3-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08222S","chronDate":"Aug.  1984","isNumber":"5005631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"131","articleId":"5005647","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5005692,"authors":[{"name":"Yashwant K.

The conditions peculiar to this problem are in many instances vastly different from those normally encountered in laboratory research, and are related to the over-all spacecraft design requirements. These new conditions attach a new significance to calibration philosophy, sampling rates, conversion accuracies, and reliability. Furthermore, the ground data handling problem of extracting information from the large quantities of data is extremely severe and usually requires careful planning by the experimenters several months prior to the actual measurement.

The effects of humidity and temperature variations are examined, and preliminary results of measurements to 800\u00b0C are given.","doi":"10.1109/IRE-I.1962.5006623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRE-I.1962.5006623","startPage":"162","endPage":"165","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5006544/5006603/05006623.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Instrumentation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5006603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and Standardization of Dielectric Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1962","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and Standardization of Dielectric Samples","publicationDate":"Dec. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"I-11","issue":"3/4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5006623/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and Standardization of Dielectric Samples","sourcePdf":"IRE-I-vI-11-n3-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027538S","chronDate":"Dec.  1962","isNumber":"5006603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5006544","citationCount":"22","articleId":"5006623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5006636,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A description is given of an alternative design employing a conical resistor element with a cylindrical outer conductor which results in a much simpler mechanical design with fewer discontinuities than the tractorial configuration. It is estimated that with the new resistor element it should be possible to achieve a resistive termination of VSWR 0.996 in the range 0-4 Gc with a \u00be inch OD system. The principle of operation is explained in terms of electromagnetic wave propagation over a resistive film surface in which the tilt angle \u03b8 of the electric field from the normal to the film surface is given by sin \u03b8= \u03c1/Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n where \u03c1 is the surface resistivity and Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n the wave impedance of the medium.

The proposed plan makes use of the cumulative results of a number of previous inspection lots to determine the disposition of a subsequent lot when a sampling plan with zero acceptance number is used and only one (1) defect is found in the sample. The proposed plan has the effect of decreasing the producer's risk in the area of relatively good quality while increasing the consumer's risk only slightly at Pa (.50) over that obtained by the MIL-STD plan with zero acceptance number. At Pa (.1) the CC curve for the plan practically coincides with the corresponding MIL-STD plan with zero acceptance number. The use of the proposed plan should overcome much of the reluctance of suppliers to the application of statistical sampling to product that is submitted in small lots and may, in some instances, permit the use of sampling when 100% inspection was heretofore necessary. It is recommended that consideration be given to the general use of Cumulative Results Sampling Plans where the continued use of sampling plans with zero acceptance numbers becomes necessary.","doi":"10.1109/IRE-PGQC.1954.5007118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRE-PGQC.1954.5007118","startPage":"14","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Reliability and Quality Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/5007112/5007113/05007118.pdf","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Reliability and Quality Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5007113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Cumulative Results Sampling Plan for Use with Sampling Tables using Zero Acceptance Numbers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1954","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Cumulative Results Sampling Plan for Use with Sampling Tables using Zero Acceptance Numbers","publicationDate":"Dec. 1954","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"PGQC-4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5007118/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Cumulative Results Sampling Plan for Use with Sampling Tables using Zero Acceptance Numbers","sourcePdf":"IRE-PGQC-vPGQC-4-n0-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034144S","chronDate":"Dec.  1954","isNumber":"5007113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5007112","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5007118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5007492,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander G.

The production, acceleration, and neutralization of beams of singly-ionized cesium ions is also discussed in limited detail. A hot tungsten contact-catalyst type of ion source is assumed and some experimental results with such a source are reviewed. Finally, a simplified treatment of the space charge neutralization of a positive ion beam in the region behind the space vehicle is presented. In this treatment, the positive-ion beam is replaced by an infinitely-long cylinder of uniformly-distributed positive charge. Electrons are emitted from an annular filament encircling the perimeter of the beam. It is shown that this approximation leads to radial oscillations of the electrons through the positive column.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008124","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008124/05008130.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1959.5008130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1959.5008130","startPage":"27","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Problems in Ionic Propulsion Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008130/","displayDocTitle":"Some Problems in Ionic Propulsion Systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"MIL-3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Problems in Ionic Propulsion Systems","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-3-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034542S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"5008124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5008130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008134,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen H.

Although such a reactor is many years from reality, some of its properties are understood well enough to indicate problems which will appear and which are peculiar to space flight. It appears that it will have to deliver electric power or thrust at a weight of about one pound per kw in order to represent significant improvement over other systems, notably the fission-electric one. One attractive feature of a fusion reactor, as now envisioned, is that it may lend itself to the direct production of electricity or even thrust, without an intermediate heat cycle. It is essential to avoid such a cycle if the weight is to be kept low.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1959.5008134","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008124/05008134.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1959.5008134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion for Space Propulsion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","displayDocTitle":"Fusion for Space Propulsion","volume":"MIL-3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1959","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion for Space Propulsion","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-3-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069184S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"5008124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5008134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008204,"authors":[{"name":"Bill B.

The Juno II can carry a 90-pound satellite or 15 pounds in an escape mission. Both vehicles were conceived to provide a quick and economical space vehicle; and as such the design was not optimum in all cases. Problems were created by this approach, such as dispersion of the upper stages as a function of spin speed, heavier payloads which require reinforcing the cluster structure, protecting the missile from aerodynamic heating on some missions, and raising the natural frequency of the cluster structure. These and other problems had to be solved as the Juno program progressed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008196","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008196/05008204.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1960.5008204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1960.5008204","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Description and Design of the Configuration of the Juno I and Juno II Launching Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-July  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-July  1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008204/","displayDocTitle":"General Description and Design of the Configuration of the Juno I and Juno II Launching Vehicles","isJournal":true,"volume":"MIL-4","issue":"2/3","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"April-July 1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Description and Design of the Configuration of the Juno I and Juno II Launching Vehicles","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-4-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032509S","chronDate":"April-July  1960","isNumber":"5008196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","articleId":"5008204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008230,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Army Jupiter missiles. The experiments were done by scientists of the Army and Navy medical departments, and personnel of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. They were done on a noninterference basis with the main mission of the missile. The primary objective of the bio-flights was to demonstrate that animals can survive ballistic flights unharmed, if an adequate life support is provided. The secondary aim was to design, construct and test such a system, to develop countdown and launching procedures, and to recover the specimen after flight. Moreover, technical and scientific information on the physiologic and behavior status of the animal was to be gained through telemetry. Although the first animal was lost, valuable data were obtained on the functioning of the bio-package during flight. They served to improve the second experiment, which added substantially to the understanding of the biomedical requirements for space flight. Moreover, Able and Baker were the first primates recovered unharmed from an operational IRBM nose cone after re-entering the earth's atmosphere.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-July  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-July  1960","publicationDate":"April-July 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"MIL-4","issue":"2/3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bio-Telemetry in the Nose Cones of U.

The computation consists of improving approximations for initial position and velocity components by successive differential corrections which are obtained from a least squares treatment of an over-determined system of condition equations while imposing elliptic motion as a constraint. Methods for obtaining approximations for the initial position and velocity components are likewise discussed.

It is further shown how a recording of this amplitude variation can be used to calculate the tumbling angle of the satellite in space. A simple example is given in which this angle between the normal of the plane of a satellite turnstile antenna system and a fixed axis in space is determined with the help of AGC recording. These recordings can be made either with linear or circular polarized receiving antenna.

S. Army Signal Missile Support Agency Laboratories, White Sands Missile Range, Las Cruces, N. M., by a group of Signal Corps engineers and technicians, utilizing components from scrapped radars and standard RF test equipment. This versatile simulator can be used to test existing radars for signal saturation and electronic counter-countermeasures techniques, such as regulating RF and video gain, contrast, etc. Provision is made to simulate antenna patterns and to vary the size of the target from 0.1 to 100 square meters. The expense involved in training radar operators to cope with raids involving hundreds of aircraft has led to the development of various target simulators. As the state-of-the-art in electronic countermeasures (ECM) improved, it became apparent that ECM simulation was also necessary to train radar operators under the conditions that would prevail when aircraft would be radiating thousands of watts of jamming power. Most of the simulators developed used IF or video injection of target signals in the simulator and did not provide the realism desired or allow the radar operator to exercise electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques effectively. The problem then became one of realistic simulation of both target and jamming signals. Field experience at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) had demonstrated that simulation could be accomplished most effectively at the RF level. This finding, by WSMR engineers, led to the design and development of the Dynamic Target and Countermeasures Simulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1960","publicationDate":"Oct. 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"MIL-4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Development of a Dynamic Target and Countermeasures Simulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Development of a Dynamic Target and Countermeasures Simulator","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-4-n4-41.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048727S","chronDate":"Oct.  1960","isNumber":"5008254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5008295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008307,"authors":[{"name":"Henry Magnuski","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc.orporated, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Magnuski","id":"37317953000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-2511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-1630"}],"articleNumber":"5008307","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008307","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Amplitude modulation","Airborne radar","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication","Silicon compounds","Military communication","Senior members","Communication networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008307","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008301/05008307.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming of Communication Systems Using FM, AM, and SSB Modulation","abstract":"Jamming of voice communication systems is a very ungrateful task and ``brute force'' jammers have to be used, while other systems, such as radar, can be jammed effectively using low power but sophisticated jammers. Geographical situation is very much against the jammer, particularly in ground-based mobile communication systems. The propagation of ground wave is such that a rapid increase of jamming power is required, as the ratio of distances of the jammer to the desired transmitter increases. The jammer is never certain whether or not the communication network is jammed and is never actually able to jam the communications completely. It can only limit the operating range of the system. Different modulation systems are considered and the necessary power density for jamming of each system is discussed. It is concluded that effective jamming of FM systems and other systems with threshold systems is easier than that of AM and, particularly, the SSB systems. However, for nuisance jamming, the opposite is true. Finally, the jamming of the SSB systems is considered in more detail and it is proven that the so-called reduced-carrier SSB systems are not easier to jam than systems with a completely suppressed carrier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"MIL-5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Jamming of Communication Systems Using FM, AM, and SSB Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming of Communication Systems Using FM, AM, and SSB Modulation","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048813S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"5008301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5008307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008321,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The principal optimization criterion employed is maximization of information or data rate. The general procedure is to treat the antenna as a spatial frequency filter which is being optimized subject to a given set of control inputs. Given these specifications, the information rate is maximized with respect to the antenna system parameters subject to the physical constraints of the system. It is shown that in a general antenna system where noise is introduced in both the object and image space, the optimum antenna aperture distribution is uniform. When the image, or receiver, noise is zero, the useful output information content and rate are independent of the aperture distribution. An equation relating the signal and noise spectra and the aperture distribution is derived which shows the way in which the signal should be coded so as to maximize the information content. Processing is discussed generally, and a specific nonlinear processing scheme is analyzed. The general conclusion is that nonlinear processing degrades the useful information rate when the SNR is low whereas it may improve the rate at high SNRs. Finally, a number of specific military and space applications of information processing antennas are considered.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008312","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008312/05008326.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008326","startPage":"94","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal and Data-Processing Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008326/","displayDocTitle":"Signal and Data-Processing Antennas","isJournal":true,"volume":"MIL-5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal and Data-Processing Antennas","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035889S","chronDate":"April  1961","isNumber":"5008312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5008326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008328,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In a pulse-compression system, a long pulse of duration T and bandwidth F (product of T and F greater than one) is transmitted. Received echoes are processed to obtain short pulses of duration 1/F. Compression ratio (the ratio of long-pulse duration to short-pulse duration) is thus the product T\u00b7F, and is a measure of the combined range and velocity resolution. Pulse compression occurs if a waveform with a nonlinear phase spectrum is passed through a filter ``phase matched'' to the waveform. Phase matched means that the nonlinear part of the network phase response is the negative of the nonlinear part of the waveform phase spectrum. The waveform with rectangular amplitude spectrum and parabolic phase spectrum is ideally suited for pulse compression. Bandwidth and duration can be independently specified, duration-bandwidth products of 100 or more are presently feasible, and the waveform remains phase matched to one filter over a wide range of Doppler frequency shifts.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008312","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008312/05008328.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008328","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principles of Pulse Compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008328/","displayDocTitle":"Principles of Pulse Compression","isJournal":true,"volume":"MIL-5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles of Pulse Compression","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n2-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045193S","chronDate":"April  1961","isNumber":"5008312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"21","articleId":"5008328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008329,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Such defects might be introduced during manufacture (at birth), or cause errors during operation (life). The number of permanent failures which could be endured by a system before it fails completely will determine its lifetime (death). In this paper, an adaptive vote-taker is proposed which compares the outputs of paralleled (redundant) system parts in a binary system and determines the most probable answer based on past performance of the separate parts. Initially, the vote-taker assigns equal significance to each redundant part, and (in a binary system) requires that a simple majority of the parts be correct. With experience, the vote-taker continually reduces the weight (significance) of the outputs from those parts that make mistakes, thereby gradually eliminating the defective parts. Thus the vote-takers (which also may be paralleled if they are unreliable) act as automatic repairmen which delete defective parts of a system. System dependability and life expectancy can be made to exceed the dependability and average life expectancy of the component parts. The heart of an adaptive vote-taker is an element providing variable gain with memory.

This paper discusses different inductive semiconductor devices which may replace coils where space is a problem. Forward-biased diodes, properly designed, behave like very lossy inductances. Combining them with negative-resistance devices increases the Q but creates serious temperature and stability problems. Relatively temperature-stable inductance elements are possible by combination of a phase shift network with a transistor. The principle, well-known in tube circuitry, gives high inductances with only a moderate Q because of the low input impedance of the transistor. Promising results have been demonstrated with a transistor operating in the a cutoff region. The device is dc stable, and has a moderate temperature sensitivity which might be partly compensated if necessary. Avalanche multiplication is used to reduce the damping resistance of the inductive transistor. Simple band-pass amplifier circuits are presented in the last section to demonstrate how to use the inductive transistor in practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1961","publicationDate":"July 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"MIL-5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inductive Semiconductor Elements and Their Application in Bandpass Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductive Semiconductor Elements and Their Application in Bandpass Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n3-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030098S","chronDate":"July  1961","isNumber":"5008339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5008354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008374,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In tracking radars the azimuth and elevation of a target can be measured to a high degree of accuracy by a nulling method. Two of the most practical methods for obtaining angular accuracy in search radars are discussed in this paper. The first method is an interferometer technique employing either two receiving antennas for each dimension of angular measurement with two frequencies of transmission for the resolution of ambiguities, or three receiving antennas positioned relative to one another so that the equivalent effect is achieved with only one-frequency transmission. The second method is a combination amplitude comparison and interferometer technique in which the ambiguities are resolved by the amplitude comparison system. An analysis of each of these systems has been made using a statistical approach in which equations are developed relating the probability of error for a specified angular accuracy to SNR power in the receiver. Curves are presented which show this relationship for a 100 to 1 beam-splitting ratio.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008374","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008359/05008374.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Precision Angle Determination by Means of Radar in a Search Mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1961","displayDocTitle":"High-Precision Angle Determination by Means of Radar in a Search Mode","volume":"MIL-5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Precision Angle Determination by Means of Radar in a Search Mode","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n4-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026718S","chronDate":"Oct.  1961","isNumber":"5008359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5008374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008375,"authors":[{"name":"Robert E.

Only the composite video of a closed-circuit TV system is required as an input. A study of the dynamic performance of typical targets indicates that the unpredictable target motion in a frame period of 1/30 sec must be an extremely small fraction of the field of view required for initial target acquisition. This permits the use of a small tracking gate in the larger acquisition field, since the target coordinates of the previous frame may be used to position the gate. This small gate permits a signal-to-noise enhancement and effectively rejects extraneous targets outside the tracking gate. The tracking is effected by subdividing the tracking area into equal early and late video gates in each coordinate. The differential video between these gates is applied to an electronic integrator in such a manner that the integrator output voltage, which is also the reference for the generation of the early-to-late gate transition, changes to place this gate transition on the target. The integrator voltages are, therefore, a measure of the target coordinates in the TV field. The operation of an experimental system fabricated to determine the feasibility of applying this technique to a range-instrumentation system has produced tracking accuracies of better than 0.05 milliradian in an acquisition field of 10\u00d710 milliradians. Current developments and additional applications of the technique are discussed briefly.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008375","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008359/05008375.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1961.5008375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic TV Tracking Theodolite for Range Instrumentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1961","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic TV Tracking Theodolite for Range Instrumentation","volume":"MIL-5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic TV Tracking Theodolite for Range Instrumentation","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n4-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041555S","chronDate":"Oct.  1961","isNumber":"5008359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","articleId":"5008375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008376,"authors":[{"name":"David K.

Capabilities of present monopulse radars are described, based upon actual test data from the AN/FPS-16. This radar has a range of 200 miles on echo targets of one-square-meter cross section and can track to an accuracy of 0.1 mil in angle and 5 yards in range. The next generation in instrumentation radar is represented by the AN/FPQ-6, now under development, which will extend accurate tracking to ranges in excess of 500 miles on echo targets and will track existing beacons beyond the moon. An important capability not yet exploited in pulsed-instrumentation radars is the coherent pulsed-Doppler velocity-measurement channel which will equal the accuracy of microwave CW systems in radial-velocity data. Provisions for adding this fourth tracking channel to both AN/FPS-16 and AN/FPQ-6 are being made, and suitable beacons are being designed. An important advantage of pulsed-Doppler radar is the ability to share a single coherent beacon in multiple-station operation, providing highly accurate, three-coordinate velocity and position data without special interstation communication links over ground paths. Beyond the immediate developments of the AN/FPQ-6, there are three major areas of improvement which will greatly extend radar performance. Solid-state maser preamplifiers will increase sensitivity of microwave radars by a factor of nearly one hundred within one or two years. Microwave antennas are already under construction in the 100-and 300-ft diameter class.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008376/","volume":"MIL-5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Future of Pulse Radar for Missile and Space Range Instrumentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Future of Pulse Radar for Missile and Space Range Instrumentation","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-5-n4-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042866S","chronDate":"Oct.  1961","isNumber":"5008359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5008376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008392,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An approximate break-even point between excessive weight of solar cells for nonoriented systems and weight of the orientation servomechanism system for solar-oriented systems occurs for a power level of 100 watts. Nickel-cadmium batteries have been used for the storage of electrical energy, whether for providing power during shadow periods encountered by low-altitude spacecraft or providing peak power during telemetry for interplanetary flights. The specific weight of such power systems varies from 750 or 1000 lb/kw to 500 lb/kw for orbits from 300 miles (statute) to 22,000 miles (synchronous orbit). Reduction in weight of batteries as well as solar cells needed for battery charging as altitude increases is responsible for this decrease in specific weight because of the decreasing time of shadow encountered by an orbiting spacecraft.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008384","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008384/05008404.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008404","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solar-Cell Power Systems for Space Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008404/","displayDocTitle":"Solar-Cell Power Systems for Space Vehicles","isJournal":true,"volume":"MIL-6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar-Cell Power Systems for Space Vehicles","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-6-n1-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023861S","chronDate":"Jan.  1962","isNumber":"5008384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","articleId":"5008404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008415,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Both focused and unfocused arrays are examined. The phase time history of echos from reflectors on the ground as a function of position is used to modify the equations for the broadside synthetic array for application to forward-looking antenna arrays. The dependence of the ``optimal'' length and resolution of an unfocused array on the look angle is derived. The gain patterns of unfocused synthetic arrays are presented for arrays of various lengths with both rectangular and exponential amplitude weighting. Calculations are made showing that the physical antenna gain pattern acts as amplitude weighting with resultant sidelobe suppression and illustrating that the final gain pattern cannot be expressed as the product of the space factor of the array times the real antenna gain pattern. However, unless the length of the synthetic array is about equal to or greater than the real antenna beamwidth times the range, the product approximation error is negligible in the region near the main lobe and amounts to a reduction in gain. The results of this analysis are then put in the form of design curves from which such parameters as the maximum resolution of an unfocused array and the length of array necessary for a given resolution at a given frequency can be obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008418/","volume":"MIL-6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1962","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theory and Evaluation of Gain Patterns of Synthetic Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and Evaluation of Gain Patterns of Synthetic Arrays","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-6-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017253S","chronDate":"April  1962","isNumber":"5008409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5008418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008420,"authors":[{"name":"W.

First, since the pulse width and pulse repetition frequency are constrained by resolution and maximum range requirements, the average transmitter power can be increased only by increasing the peak transmitter power. Second, the limitation imposed by the sampling theorem prevents unambiguous measurement of Doppler frequencies higher than one half the pulse repetition frequency. These disadvantages can be circumvented by operating with continuous transmission, suitably modulating the transmitter power and correlating returned echoes with a delayed replica of the modulating signal. An excellent waveform for modulating the transmitter is the pseudo-random code generated by a shift register with multiple feedback paths. The autocorrelation function of the code has a single narrow peak each code length and low sidelobes. The code is easy to generate. Long delays are possible, since it is necessary only to memorize the code generation logic and not the code itself. The binary nature of the code makes it easy to perform such operations as multiplication. Realization of the desirable properties of the pseudo-random code depends on the manner in which the radio frequency carrier is modulated and demodulated. It is shown that phase-reversal modulation results in little distortion of the code, while frequency modulation can give rise to false range indications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1962","publicationDate":"April 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"MIL-6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-Wave Radar with High Range Resolution and Unambiguous Velocity Determination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-Wave Radar with High Range Resolution and Unambiguous Velocity Determination","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-6-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029392S","chronDate":"April  1962","isNumber":"5008409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5008422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008423,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is concluded that amplitude-weighting in the time domain (at IF) is a convenient method of suppressing sidelobes. An integration loss factor is defined which characterizes the decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting from the inclusion of weighting. For a radar system which is peak-power-limited, it is shown that the integration loss is less if the amplitude-weighting is accomplished entirely at the receiver while ``mismatching'' the system, rather than weighting at both transmitter and receiver while preserving a ``matched'' system. Some common amplitude-weighting functions are compared in terms of integration loss, main-lobe broadening, and sidelobe structure. The Hamming weighting is shown to be a good compromise among the above factors and, in addition, it is relatively easy to implement. The effect of a time-mismatch between the Hamming amplitude-weighting function and an echo pulse is considered for the special case of linear-frequency modulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008423","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008409/05008423.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"169","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sidelobe Suppression in a Range-Channel Pulse-Compression Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1962","displayDocTitle":"Sidelobe Suppression in a Range-Channel Pulse-Compression Radar","volume":"MIL-6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1962","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sidelobe Suppression in a Range-Channel Pulse-Compression Radar","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-6-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053527S","chronDate":"April  1962","isNumber":"5008409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"22","articleId":"5008423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5008424,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This limit is a function of the observed target's relative radial velocity, and the effect on the return signal is characterized by both a pulse stretching and amplitude reduction if the limit is exceeded. The use of a logarithmic phase-modulation signal waveform and a corresponding ``matched'' receiver possesses the desirable characteristics of the linear FM and in addition has no upper limit to the magnitude of the compression ratio.

A study was made of the effects reported in unclassified literature with the object of finding which type of transmissions, if any, could still be relied upon under such conditions. The conclusion reached is that VHF links using meteorscatter or ionoscatter propagation would have escaped the severe blackouts experienced with LF, MF and HF transmissions. The positive disruption of such VHF links requires some 100 times more ionization than was produced by these bombs. To a lesser extent VLF transmissions would also have escaped a blackout-in this case it is estimated that some 10 times the ionization is required for a blackout. These conclusions refer to transmissions in which the midpoint of the path is less than, say, 1000 km from the explosion.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008460","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Military Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008109/5008454/05008460.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-MIL.1962.5008460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of High-Altitude Nuclear Explosions on Radio Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1962","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of High-Altitude Nuclear Explosions on Radio Communication","volume":"MIL-6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of High-Altitude Nuclear Explosions on Radio Communication","sourcePdf":"IRET-MIL-vMIL-6-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05483S","chronDate":"Oct.  1962","isNumber":"5008454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008109","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5008460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5008461,"authors":[{"name":"Lillian R.

The pipette microelectrode is superior to the metallic microelectrode for simultaneous recording of resting and action potentials. However, the low-pass circuit formed by the high electrode resistance (1 to 100 megohms) and the amplifier input capacity causes distortion of the action potential waveform. The distortion can be reduced by amplifier equalization, capacity reduction, and capacity neutralization. Some of the limitations of these methods are: 1) Compensation for waveform distortion due to the low-pass circuit results in an increase of the amplifier noise, approximately as the inverse characteristic of the low-pass circuit. A filter for improving the signal-to-noise ratio is considered. 2) Neutralization is accomplished with a generated negative capacity which approximates a pure capacity only over a limited bandwidth. This limitation may be evaluated with a six-element synthetic circuit closely approximating a realizable negative capacity. 3) The accuracy of neutralization adjustment is inherently limited by the difficulty of inserting a calibrating voltage in place of the bioelectric generator. Moreover, the distributed capacitance of the microelectric cannot be exactly neutralized by a pure negative capacity. Despite these limitations, neutralization is the most applicable of the methods discussed, and highly successful neutralized input capacity amplifiers have been designed and used in several laboratories. Vacuum tube and transistorized versions of neutralized amplifiers are briefly described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1958","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1958","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 1958","volume":"PGME-10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of Bioelectric Potentials With Microelectrodes and Neutralized Input Capacity Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of Bioelectric Potentials With Microelectrodes and Neutralized Input Capacity Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"IRET-PGME-vPGME-10-n0-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031214S","chronDate":"March  1958","isNumber":"5008476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5007879","citationCount":"47","articleId":"5008482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5008657,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In general, the results of the theory agree well with experimental results of Aeronutronic [8] and aid in their interpretation.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-SET.1960.5008720","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008636/5008713/05008720.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-SET.1960.5008720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Different Types of Video Filters on PDM-FM and PCM-FM Radio Telemetry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008720/","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Different Types of Video Filters on PDM-FM and PCM-FM Radio Telemetry","volume":"SET-6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Different Types of Video Filters on PDM-FM and PCM-FM Radio Telemetry","sourcePdf":"IRET-SET-vSET-6-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052282S","chronDate":"June  1960","isNumber":"5008713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008636","articleId":"5008720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008745,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The relative performances of phase-coherent and noncoherent transmission of binary data in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise have been analyzed and compared [1] and [2]. This paper considers the result of encoding independent equiprobable binary words or sequences of independent binary digits into sets of binary code words. These are transmitted over a channel perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise and detected by correlating them with their stored or locally generated replicas at the receiver. The word error probabilities and bit error probabilities for low cross-correlation codes are determined as a function of the ratio (received signal energy)/bit/(noise power)/(unit bandwidth) The received information rate and the potential channel capacity are also computed. It is shown that in the limit as the code word length and the bandwidth approach infinity, the received information rate approaches the channel capacity for only one value of the above ratio.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-SET.1961.5008745","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008636/5008739/05008745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-SET.1961.5008745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008739","startPage":"3","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Coded Phase-Coherent Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Coded Phase-Coherent Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1961","isJournal":true,"volume":"SET-7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1961","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Coded Phase-Coherent Communications","sourcePdf":"IRET-SET-vSET-7-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040206S","chronDate":"March  1961","isNumber":"5008739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008636","citationCount":"59","articleId":"5008745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5008781,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The received signals are assumed corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. The following modulations are analyzed explicitly: 1) Direct-carrier phase reversal, 2) Squarewave-subcarrier phase reversal, 3) Sinusoidal-subcarrier phase reversal. It is shown that direct-carrier and squarewave-subcarrier phase reversal modulations are optimally demodulated with the switching-type phase detector. The sinuosidal-subcarrier phase reversal modulation, however, is not optimally demodulated by this method. The degradation from optimal product demodulation is slight for modulation indices of 2 radians or less but becomes greater for larger indices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"SET-8","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"A Note on Demodulation of PCM/PM Signals with Switching-Type Phase Detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Note on Demodulation of PCM/PM Signals with Switching-Type Phase Detectors","sourcePdf":"IRET-SET-vSET-8-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051041S","chronDate":"March  1962","isNumber":"5008788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008636","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5008797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008817,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Efficient decoding of these sequences in turn necessitates a knowledge of the instants in time at which one code word ends and the succeeding word begins. This paper presents a method for obtaining this synchronization which neither decreases the channel capacity nor increases the complexity of the encoding equipment. The method is to select, from the many encodings which are equally good for purposes of synchronous operation, that encoding for which the maximum absolute value of the correlation po between any code word and any sequence formed from the overlap of two code words is a minimum. Thus a large correlation is observed only in the synchronous phase position. This technique is applied to an important class of block codes, the binary orthogonal codes. An algorithm for constructing these codes with the desired self-synchronizing properties is presented, and upper bounds on the value of po are thereby established.","doi":"10.1109/IRET-SET.1962.5008817","startPage":"112","endPage":"117","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/5008636/5008804/05008817.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRET-SET.1962.5008817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Telemetry Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Maximum likelihood detection","Decoding","White noise","Gaussian noise","Detectors","Gaussian channels","Tellurium","Channel capacity","Modulation coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1962","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Telemetry Codes","volume":"SET-8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1962","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Telemetry Codes","sourcePdf":"IRET-SET-vSET-8-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030222S","chronDate":"June  1962","isNumber":"5008804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5008636","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5008817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008839,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Such an array is essentially a microelectronic memory with some combinational logic associated with each storage element. A logic-in-memory computer is described that is organized around a logic-enhanced ``cache'' memory array. Used as a cache, a logic-in-memory array performs as a high-speed buffer between a conventional CPU and a conventional memory. The effect on the computer system of the cache and its control mechanism is to make the main memory appear to have all of the processing capabilities and almost the same performance as the cache. Operations within the array are naturally organized as operations on blocks of data called ``sectors.'' Among the operations that can be performed are arithmetic and logical operations on pairs of elements from two sectors, and a variety of associative search operations on a single sector. For such operations, the main memory of the computer appears to the program to be composed of a collection of logic-in-memory arrays, each the size of a sector. Because of the high-speed, highly parallel sector operations, the logic-in-memory computer points to a new direction for achieving orders of magnitude increase in computer performance. Moreover, since the computer is specifically organized for large-scale integration, the increased performance might be obtained for a comparatively small dollar cost.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1970.5008902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5008889/05008902.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1970.5008902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Logic-in-Memory Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1970","displayDocTitle":"A Logic-in-Memory Computer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008902/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Logic-in-Memory Computer","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-19-n1-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058725S","chronDate":"Jan.  1970","isNumber":"5008889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"86","articleId":"5008902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5008917,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald W.

We describe a new method of computing the minimum-perimeter polygon (MPP) of any digitized silhouette satisfying certain constraints of connectedness and smoothness, and establish the underlying theory. Such a digitized silhouette is called a ``regular complex,'' in accordance with the usage in piecewise linear topology. The method makes use of the concept of a stretched string constrained to lie in the cellular boundary of the digitized silhouette. We show that, by properly marking the virtual as well as the real vertices of an MPP, the MPP can serve as a precise representation of any regular complex, and that this representation is often an economical one.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5008942/05008948.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5008948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5008948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-Perimeter Polygons of Digitized Silhouettes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Terminology","Probability density function","Topology","Finite element methods","Computers","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial retina","cellular convexity","digitization of pictures","image processing by computer","minimum-perimeter polygon","pattern recognition","smoothing of silhouettes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1972","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-Perimeter Polygons of Digitized Silhouettes","volume":"C-21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1972","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-Perimeter Polygons of Digitized Silhouettes","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043199S","chronDate":"March  1972","isNumber":"5008942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"101","articleId":"5008948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008949,"authors":[{"name":"Charles T.

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point.

It is possible to compute the accuracy of the sampled random variables from knowledge of the read-only memory contents. The sampling accuracy of the device may be arbitrarily increased by varying any of several design parameters. Our particular pseudonoise generator produced 200 000 random seven-bit variables/s.

Both the sampling speed and accuracy of a conditional bit pseudonoise generator can be increased much in excess of our implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5008974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5008969/05008974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5008974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008969","startPage":"346","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudonoise with Arbitrary Amplitude Distribution--Part II: Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pseudonoise with Arbitrary Amplitude Distribution--Part II: Hardware Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1972","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1972","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudonoise with Arbitrary Amplitude Distribution--Part II: Hardware Implementation","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052143S","chronDate":"April  1972","isNumber":"5008969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5008974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008975,"authors":[{"name":"Teuvo Kohonen","affiliation":["Department of Techncal Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Otaniemi, Finland"],"firstName":"Teuvo","lastName":"Kohonen","id":"37318173400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5008975","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":567,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1260},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"A new model for associative memory, based on a correlation matrix, is suggested.

This model is failure tolerant and facilitates associative search of information; these are properties that are usually assigned to holographic memories. Two classes of memories are discussed: a complete correlation matrix memory (CCMM), and randomly organized incomplete correlation matrix memories (ICMM). The data recalled from the latter are stochastic variables but the fidelity of recall is shown to have a deterministic limit if the number of memory elements grows without limits. A special case of correlation matrix memories is the auto-associative memory in which any part of the memorized information can be used as a key. The memories are selective with respect to accumulated data. The ICMM exhibits adaptive improvement under certain circumstances. It is also suggested that correlation matrix memories could be applied for the classification of data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5008969/05008975.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5008975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5008975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5008969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5008975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Matrix Memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Reactive power","Finite element methods","Mathematical model","Manganese","Noise","Data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associative memory","associative net","associative recall","correlation matrix memory","nonholographic associative memory","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5008975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1972","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Matrix Memories","volume":"C-21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1972","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Matrix Memories","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06587S","chronDate":"April  1972","isNumber":"5008969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"567","articleId":"5008975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5008977,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This formulation has the following advantages over other methods of logic design. 1) General feed-forward networks can be dealt with rather than two-level or three-level networks usually treated in conventional switching theory. 2) Network restrictions such as fan-in and fan-out restrictions are easily incorporated. 3) Various gate types such as NOR, NAND, AND-OR combination, NOR-AND combination, and those gates with NOR-OR dual outputs can be treated. 4) Various objectives such as the number of gates and the number of connections are minimized. 5) Incompletely specified functions can be handled without additional difficulty. 6) The formulation can be extended to multiple-output networks. To solve the resulting IP problems, the implicit enumeration method of integer programming is found to be suitable. An IP code ILLIP (Illinois Integer Programming Code) is implemented based on the implicit enumeration by incorporating some new gimmicks such as pseudounderlining. Then the ILLIP is used to solve the IP problems for logical design by making use of the inherent structure of our problems. Various optimal networks are derived by a computer as follows: optimal NOR networks and optimal NOR-AND networks for all functions of up through three variables, one-bit adders with various gate types, and others. These results indicate the computational feasibility of the integer programming approach.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5009010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009001/05009010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5009010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"573","endPage":"582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Optimal Switching Networks by Integer Programming","volume":"C-21","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Optimal Switching Networks by Integer Programming","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n6-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04216S","chronDate":"June  1972","isNumber":"5009001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"5009010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009015,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Faults that are inherently indistinguishable are identified and combined into classes that form a geometric structure that effectively subdivides the original circuit into fan-out-free segments. This fan-out-free characteristic allows a simplified analysis of multiple fault conditions. For certain circuits, including all two-level single-output circuits, it is shown that the detection of all single faults implies the detection of all multiple faults. The behavior of any circuit under fault conditions is represented in terms of the classes of indistinguishable faults. This results in a description of the faulty circuit by means of Boolean equations that are readily manipulated for the purpose of fault simulation or test generation. A connection graph interpretation of this fault representation is discussed. Heuristic methods for the selection of efficient tests without extensive computation are derived from these connection graphs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5009041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009035","startPage":"858","endPage":"866","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009035/05009041.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5009041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Representation for Faults in Combinational Digital Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Logic gates","Data mining","Fault diagnosis","Probability density function","Digital circuits","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combinational logic","digital systems","fault detection","fault diagnosis","fault models","multiple faults"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1972","displayDocTitle":"A New Representation for Faults in Combinational Digital Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1972","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"C-21","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Representation for Faults in Combinational Digital Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n8-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027687S","chronDate":"Aug.  1972","isNumber":"5009035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"88","articleId":"5009041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5009050,"authors":[{"name":"Theodosios Pavlidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Theodosios","lastName":"Pavlidis","id":"37320092900"},{"name":"Geng Seng Fang","affiliation":["Computer Science Corporation, Falls Church, VA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Geng Seng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37304781300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5009050","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009050","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Timing","Error analysis","Maintenance engineering","Vibrations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Averaging statistics","engine signature analysis","internal combustion engines","mechanical fault diagnosis","pattern recognition","signal discrimination","signal segmentation","waveform recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5009050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009035/05009050.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5009050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Segmentation Technique for Waveform Classification","abstract":"This note describes the determination of waveform segments which contain the information necessary for classification.

Two aspects of the model are distinguished: logical and physical. General parallel- or multiple-stream organizations are examined as to type and effectiveness-especially regarding intrinsic logical difficulties. The overlapped simplex processor (SISD) is limited by data dependencies. Branching has a particularly degenerative effect. The parallel processors [single-instruction stream-multiple-data stream (SIMD)] are analyzed. In particular, a nesting type explanation is offered for Minsky's conjecture-the performance of a parallel processor increases as log M instead of M (the number of data stream processors). Multiprocessors (MIMD) are subjected to a saturation syndrome based on general communications lockout. Simplified queuing models indicate that saturation develops when the fraction of task time spent locked out (L/E) approaches 1/n, where n is the number of processors. Resources sharing in multiprocessors can be used to avoid several other classic organizational problems.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1972.5009071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1972.5009071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009065/05009071.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness","volume":"C-21","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-21-n9-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061528S","chronDate":"Sept.  1972","isNumber":"5009065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"859","articleId":"5009071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009076,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Y.

An example of this is the page replacement problem in virtual memory computers. The problem is solved by using a replacement algorithm that selects code or data items that are to be removed from executable memory whenever new items must be brought in and no more free storage space remains. An automaton theoretic model of replacement algorithms is introduced for the class of ``random partially preloaded'' replacement algorithms, which contain certain algorithms of practical and theoretical interest. An analysis of this class is provided in order to evaluate their performance, using the assumption that the references to the items to be stored are identically distributed independent random variables. With this model, it is shown that the well-known page replacement algorithms FIFO and RAND yield the same long-run page-fault rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009100/05009115.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1973.5009115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1973.5009115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach to the Evaluation of a Class of Replacement Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Silicon","Data mining","Probability density function","Computers","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov chains","memory hierarchies","page-fault rates","page replacement algorithms","paging","storage allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1973","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to the Evaluation of a Class of Replacement Algorithms","volume":"C-22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to the Evaluation of a Class of Replacement Algorithms","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-22-n6-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052473S","chronDate":"June  1973","isNumber":"5009100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"81","articleId":"5009115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009153,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo B.

This paper uses a technique called recursive doubling in an algorithm for solving a large class of recurrence problems on parallel computers such as the Iliac IV. Recursive doubling involves the splitting of the computation of a function into two equally complex subfunctions whose evaluation can be performed simultaneously in two separate processors. Successive splitting of each of these subfunctions spreads the computation over more processors. This algorithm can be applied to any recurrence equation of the form x\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>\n = f(b\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>\n, g(a\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>\n, x\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i-1</inf>\n)) where f and g are functions that satisfy certain distributive and associative-like properties. Although this recurrence is first order, all linear mth-order recurrence equations can be cast into this form. Suitable applications include linear recurrence equations, polynomial evaluation, several nonlinear problems, the determination of the maximum or minimum of N numbers, and the solution of tridiagonal linear equations. The resulting algorithm computes the entire series x\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n, ..., x\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</inf>\n in time proportional to [log\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n N] on a computer with N-fold parallelism.

The basic cell is a switching device with two inputs, two outputs, and two control variables x and T. The cell structure is either purely combinational or with unit delay depending upon the control variable T. The control variable x sets up either a ``crossing mode'' or a ``bending mode'' in the cell. Thus a two-dimensional cellular array without time delays has the connection capabilities of a crossbar switch. Any combinational switching function can be realized by appropriate choice of control variables while the inputs to the edges of the plane are fixed. Alternatively, the control variables can be fixed while the inputs to the edges of the cellular plane are varied from function to function. A cubic array is constructed from a set of identical cellular planes packed one upon the other such that the control variables applied to the first plane will penetrate to all other planes without time delay. It is shown that any k functions of the same variables can be synthesized on such a cubic array. By allowing the control variable T to delay some signals in the array, such a cubic array can be used to realize any synchronous sequential machine with single or multiple inputs and/or feedback functions. Any defective cell in the array can be tested and isolated. The array can be stripped, divided, or interconnected.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combinational and Sequential Cellular Structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1973.5009170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009165/05009170.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1973.5009170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Combinational and Sequential Cellular Structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-22","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinational and Sequential Cellular Structures","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-22-n9-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028093S","chronDate":"Sept.  1973","isNumber":"5009165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5009170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009200,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey H.

This paper discusses some variations of Lee's algorithm which can be used in certain contexts to improve its efficiency. First, it is shown that, by storing frontier cells in an array of stacks rather than a single list, costly searching operations can be eliminated without significantly increasing storage requirements. Second, it is shown that if each path's cost is the sum of the weights of its cells then retrace codes can be assigned to cells as soon as they are reached rather than when they are expanded. Third, it is shown that if the additional restriction is made that each cell's weight is not a function of the state of any nonneighbor cell, then an encoding scheme requiring only two bits/cell can be used for both rectangular and hexagonal grids.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Variations of Lee's Algorithm","doi":"10.1109/TC.1976.5009200","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1976.5009200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009193/05009200.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1976","displayDocTitle":"Some Variations of Lee's Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-25","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Variations of Lee's Algorithm","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-25-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020511S","chronDate":"Jan.  1976","isNumber":"5009193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"53","articleId":"5009200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5009205,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Lang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Lang","id":"37284101800"},{"name":"Harold S.

As an example, maximum response time of SN74S74 is estimated on the basis of a set of statistical measurements. The measurement technique presented may be used for any type of input synchronizer.

The model of SIMD machines used in the first part of the paper requires all data transfers between processing elements to be representable as permutations on the processing element addresses. We use the theory of permutation groups to aid in the analysis of the cycle structures of the different interconnection networks and discuss the importance of the cycle structure to the SIMD machine architect. A processing element address masking scheme, to determine which processing elements will be active, is introduced. The effects of this masking system when used with different networks are examined. Model independent techniques for proving lower bounds on the time required for a network to simulate a particular interconnection are presented. These techniques are used to prove a lower time bound on the simulation of each network by each of the other networks.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1977.5009294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009284/05009294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.5009294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009284","startPage":"153","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis Techniques for SIMD Machine Interconnection Networks and the Effects of Processor Address Masks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis Techniques for SIMD Machine Interconnection Networks and the Effects of Processor Address Masks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis Techniques for SIMD Machine Interconnection Networks and the Effects of Processor Address Masks","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-26-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043264S","chronDate":"Feb.  1977","isNumber":"5009284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"58","articleId":"5009294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5009297,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth E.

However, increased design and implementation costs should be expected when fault-tolerance is being introduced into the architecture of a processor array. When the processor array is implemented within a single VLSI chip, these cost increases are directly related to the chip silicon area. Thus, the increase in area should be weighed against the improved performance of the gracefully degrading fault-tolerant processor array. In addition, a larger chip area might reduce the wafer yield to an unaceptable level making the use of fault-tolerant VLSI processor arrays impractical. The objective of this paper is to devise performance measures for the evaluation of the effectiveness and area utilization of various fault-tolerant techniques. Another goal is to analyze the reduction in wafer yield and investigate the possibility of yield enhancement through redundancy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.5009312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009305","startPage":"21","endPage":"27","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009305/05009312.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Area and Yield Considerations for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Processor Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1984","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Area and Yield Considerations for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Processor Arrays","publicationDate":"Jan. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-33","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Area and Yield Considerations for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Processor Arrays","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-33-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057408S","chronDate":"Jan.  1984","isNumber":"5009305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"78","articleId":"5009312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009314,"authors":[{"name":"Vasilii Zakharov","affiliation":["University of Genova, Geneva, Switzerland","CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vasilii","lastName":"Zakharov","id":"37319387900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5009314","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":102},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009314","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Computers","Concurrent computing","Pipeline processing","Arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array processing","computer architecture","computer history","concurrency","multiple processor systems","parallel algorithms","parallel computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.5009314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009305/05009314.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.5009314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelism and Array Processing","abstract":"Modern computing, as well as the historical development of computing, has been dominated by sequential monoprocessing.

The account seeks to treat parallelism in a historical context, and to identify all the main aspects of concurrency in computation right up to the present time. The review includes a discussion both of parallel computer architectures and functional units as components in these architectures.

Furthermore, the whole convolver can be embedded in one single uniform bit-serial one-dimensional structure. This extremely pin-saving and VLSI-oriented design can also be used for recursive filters and for 2D signal processing.

Although this network has essentially the same performance bounds as Batcher's bitonic sort, our design has the property that no comparator in the network is critical in the sense that any faulty comparator can be bypassed without disturbing the functionality of the network (just its speed). The novelty of the design is that the robustness is derived from the underlying algorithm. The network will sort in the presence of many faulty comparators. Moreover, of the (N log N)/2 comparators, only N pairs of comparators are critical. That is, the network fails only when both comparators in a pair fail. Our results enable one to build large sorting networks on a single wafer so that a high percentage of the fabricated wafers can be used; some of the wafers will sort very quickly (the ones with no faulty components), most will sort at somewhat slower than optimal speeds, but only a few will fail to be useful as sorting networks (due to too many badly placed faults).","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.5009383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009374/05009383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.5009383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009374","startPage":"326","endPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Sorting Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Sorting Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1985","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Sorting Network","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-34-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026355S","chronDate":"April  1985","isNumber":"5009374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"40","articleId":"5009383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009384,"authors":[{"name":"Gianfranco Bilardi","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA","Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Bilardi","id":"37318761900"},{"name":"Franco P.

Sufficient conditions to guarantee no degradation in performance due to parallelism and necessary conditions for allowing parallelism to have a speedup greater than the number of processors are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coping with Anomalies in Parallel Branch-and-Bound Algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1986.5009434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009420/05009434.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.5009434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1986","displayDocTitle":"Coping with Anomalies in Parallel Branch-and-Bound Algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coping with Anomalies in Parallel Branch-and-Bound Algorithms","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-35-n6-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043111S","chronDate":"June  1986","isNumber":"5009420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"74","articleId":"5009434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5009446,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Ashford Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Edward Ashford","lastName":"Lee","id":"37069854100"},{"name":"David G.

In some situations, designers are not willing to squander computing resources for the sake of programmer convenience. This is particularly true when the target machine is a programmable DSP chip. However, the runtime overhead inherent in most LGDF implementations is not required for most signal processing systems because such systems are mostly synchronous (in the DSP sense). Synchronous data flow (SDF) differs from traditional data flow in that the amount of data produced and consumed by a data flow node is specified a priori for each input and output. This is equivalent to specifying the relative sample rates in signal processing system. This means that the scheduling of SDF nodes need not be done at runtime, but can be done at compile time (statically), so the runtime overhead evaporates. The sample rates can all be different, which is not true of most current data-driven digital signal processing programming methodologies. Synchronous data flow is closely related to computation graphs, a special case of Petri nets. This self-contained paper develops the theory necessary to statically schedule SDF programs on single or multiple processors. A class of static (compile time) scheduling algorithms is proven valid, and specific algorithms are given for scheduling SDF systems onto single or multiple processors.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009446","startPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009439/05009446.pdf","endPage":"35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009446/","displayDocTitle":"Static Scheduling of Synchronous Data Flow Programs for Digital Signal Processing","volume":"C-36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Scheduling of Synchronous Data Flow Programs for Digital Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031688S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"5009439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"788","articleId":"5009446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009448,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, special structures inherent in such decoders offer new methods for incorporating distributed error control throughout their designs. The underlying design principles and motivations are emphasized providing a variety of options to meet various requirements. Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are used to exemplify the new techniques as applied to the usual three standard subsystems present in a decoder. The first and last parts, syndrome calculations and transform inversion, both involve finite field transforms suggesting the effective application of fast transform algorithms. Error control features are based upon the chord properties of the transform coefficients including even fast algorithms. The third subsystem, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, can be protected through a chord recursion property affiliated with the error location connection polynomial. The propagation and spread of internal errors are studied and a special sink register compares several quantities, available in close proximity, to their easily recomputed counterparts. Most of these results are applicable to generalized to decoders for codes over higher ordered alphabets such as Reed-Solomon codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009448/","volume":"C-36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Decoders for Cyclic Error-Correcting Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Decoders for Cyclic Error-Correcting Codes","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02193S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"5009439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5009448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009451,"authors":[{"name":"Eiji Fujiwara","affiliation":["N.

The proposed checker, called a generalized prediction checker (GPC), has an extended and generalized form of conventional parity prediction checkers, and includes a duplication checker as a special case. A parity check matrix H imparts arbitrary error detection ability to the new GPC. The GPC is made perfectly self-testing by applying a new method that adds one extra input to the cascaded multiinput comparator and to the cascaded XOR tree circuit in the GPC. This extra input may take any value during normal operation. The \u2190self-checking GPC is implemented for specific circuit examples and verified. For these examples, the \u2190self-checking GPC's show 100 percent fault coverage for single stuck faults in both the circuit under check and the checker itself. Using this checker, the built-in testing method taking advantage of the checker's automatic fault detection ability is shown to be suitable for testing combinational circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009451/","volume":"C-36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Checking Generalized Prediction Checker and Its Use for Built-In Testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Checking Generalized Prediction Checker and Its Use for Built-In Testing","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03102S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"5009439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"38","articleId":"5009451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5009452,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

In LSI and VLSI technology, memories are often organized on a multiple bit (or byte) per chip basis. For example, some 256K bit DRAM's are organized in 32K \u00d7 8 bit-bytes. Byte-oriented codes such as Reed-Solomon (RS) codes can provide efficient low overhead error control for such memories. However, the standard iterative algorithm for decoding RS codes is too slow for these applications. In this correspondence we present a special decoding technique for double-byte-error-correcting (DBEC), triple-byte-error-detecting (TBED) RS codes which is capable of high-speed operation. This technique is designed to find the error locations and the error values directly from the syndrome without having to use the iterative algorithm to find the error locator polynomial.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009463/05009476.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding of DBEC-TBED Reed-Solomon Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of DBEC-TBED Reed-Solomon Codes","volume":"C-36","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of DBEC-TBED Reed-Solomon Codes","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n11-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02474S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"5009463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5009476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009478,"authors":[{"name":"Selim G.

Utilizing loop parallelism is clearly most crucial in achieving high system and program performance. Because of its simplicity, guided self-scheduling is particularly suited for implementation on real parallel machines. This method achieves simultaneously the two most important objectives: load balancing and very low synchronization overhead. For certain types of loops we show analytically that guided self-scheduling uses minimal overhead and achieves optimal schedules. Two other interesting properties of this method are its insensitivity to the initial processor configuration (in time) and its parameterized nature which allows us to tune it for different systems. Finally we discuss experimental results that clearly show the advantage of guided self-scheduling over the most widely known dynamic methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided Self-Scheduling: A Practical Scheduling Scheme for Parallel Supercomputers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009487/05009495.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Guided Self-Scheduling: A Practical Scheduling Scheme for Parallel Supercomputers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-36","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided Self-Scheduling: A Practical Scheduling Scheme for Parallel Supercomputers","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n12-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030882S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"5009487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"386","articleId":"5009495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5009496,"authors":[{"name":"David T.

In this paper we present an evaluation of a storage scheme that reduces the average memory access time in a vector-oriented architecture. A skewing scheme is used to map vector components into parallel memory modules such that, for most vector access patterns, the number of memory conflicts is reduced over that observed in interleaved parallel memory systems. Address and data buffers are used locally in each module so that transient nonuniformities which occur in some access patterns do not degrade performance. Previous investigations into skewing techniques have attempted to provide conflict-free access for a limited subset of access patterns. The goal of this investigation is different. The skewing scheme evaluated here does not eliminate all memory conflicts but it does improve the average performance of vector access over interleaved systems for a wide range of strides. It is shown that little extra hardware is required to implement the skewing scheme. Also, far fewer restrictions are placed on the number of memory modules in the system than are present in other proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009496","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009487/05009496.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector Access Performance in Parallel Memories Using a Skewed Storage Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Artificial neural networks","Equations","Data mining","Read only memory","Probability density function","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Address distributions","conflict-free access","memory performance","parallel memories","skewing schemes","vector access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Vector Access Performance in Parallel Memories Using a Skewed Storage Scheme","volume":"C-36","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector Access Performance in Parallel Memories Using a Skewed Storage Scheme","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n12-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027144S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"5009487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"55","articleId":"5009496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5009497,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37278134200"},{"name":"Joydeep Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joydeep","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37275116200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5009497","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":171},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hypercubes","Construction industry","Topology","Routing","Network topology","Computers","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connectionist computation","distributed supercomputing","hierarchical networks","hypercube","localized communication","massive parallelism","multicomputers"]}],"abstract":"A new class of modular networks is proposed for hierarchically constructing massively parallel computer systems for distributed supercomputing and AI applications.

This paper presents the principles of constructing hypernets and analyzes their architectural potentials in terms of message routing complexity, cost-effective support for global as well as localized communication, I/O capabilities, and fault tolerance.

In addition, we provide algorithms for performing checkpoint repair that incur little overhead in time and modest cost in hardware. We also note that our algorithms require no additional complexity or time for use with write-back cache memory systems than they do with write-through cache memory systems, contrary to statements made by previous researchers.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009500","startPage":"1496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009487/05009500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009500","endPage":"1514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Checkpoint Repair for High-Performance Out-of-Order Execution Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Checkpoint Repair for High-Performance Out-of-Order Execution Machines","volume":"C-36","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Checkpoint Repair for High-Performance Out-of-Order Execution Machines","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n12-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061443S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"5009487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"72","articleId":"5009500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009502,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Annaratone","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Institute for Integrated Systems, ETH Zentrum, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Annaratone","id":"37322422200"},{"name":"Emmanuel Arnould","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Arnould","id":"37322422100"},{"name":"Thomas Gross","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gross","id":"38493528800"},{"name":"H.

A typical Warp array includes ten cells, thus having a peak computation rate of 100 MFLOPS. The Warp array can be extended to include more cells to accommodate applications capable of using the increased computational bandwidth. Warp is integrated as an attached processor into a Unix host system. Programs for Warp are written in a high-level language supported by an optimizing compiler. The first ten-cell prototype was completed in February 1986; delivery of production machines started in April 1987. Extensive experimentation with both the prototype and production machines has demonstrated that the Warp architecture is effective in the application domain of robot navigation as well as in other fields such as signal processing, scientific computation, and computer vision research. For these applications, Warp is typically several hundred times faster than a VAX 11/780 class computer. This paper describes the architecture, implementation, and performance of the Warp machine. Each major architectural decision is discussed and evaluated with system, software, and application considerations. The programming model and tools developed for the machine are also described. The paper concludes with performance data for a large number of applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","volume":"C-36","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Warp Computer: Architecture, Implementation, and Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Warp Computer: Architecture, Implementation, and Performance","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n12-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083156S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"5009487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"221","articleId":"5009502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5009516,"authors":[{"name":"Hermann Kopetz","affiliation":["Institute of Tecbnische Informatik, Technical University of of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Kopetz","id":"37279749800"},{"name":"Wilhelm Ochsenreiter","affiliation":["Institute of Tecbnische Informatik, Technical University of of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilhelm","lastName":"Ochsenreiter","id":"37321692600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5009516","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":383,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":3387},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Clocks","Accuracy","Real time systems","Delay","Time measurement","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed real-time systems","external synchronization","fault-tolerant clock synchronization","internal synchronization","synchronization accuracy","VLSI clock"]}],"abstract":"The generation of a fault-tolerant global time base with known accuracy of synchronization is one of the important operating system functions in a distributed real-time system.

When a single node occasionally experiences an overload of jobs, it may still be possible to execute some of the otherwise lost jobs by invoking a load sharingnode algorithm to distribute the local overload to other system nodes. We examine several relatively simple approaches to load sharing and show that these simple real-time load sharing algorithms may often perform as well as their more complex counterparts. Approximate analytic performance models are developed and validated through simulation. The performance results suggest that, over a relatively wide range of system parameters, the performance of these simple approaches is substantially better than the case of no load sharing and often close to that of a theoretically optimum algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009508/05009522.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Sharing in Soft Real-Time Distributed Computer Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009522/","displayDocTitle":"Load Sharing in Soft Real-Time Distributed Computer Systems","volume":"C-36","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Sharing in Soft Real-Time Distributed Computer Systems","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n8-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036901S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"5009508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"36","articleId":"5009522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5009532,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Gordon","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel","Department of Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Gordon","id":"37306670700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5009532","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary trees","Layout","Connectors","Data mining","Probability density function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area-efficient embedding","arrays of processing elements","binary tree layout","graph embedding","interconnection network","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of embedding a complete binary tree in squareor hexagonally-connected VLSI arrays Of processing elements (PE's). This problem can be solved in a radically different manner from current layout techniques which are aimed at laying out a given graph in the plane. The difference is due to the fact that a PE can be used both as a tree node and as a connecting element between distant nodes. New embedding schemes are presented in which (asymptotically) 100 percent of the PE's are utilized as tree nodes. This is a significant savings over known schemes, which achieve 50 percent utilization (the well-known H-tree) and 71 percent for some hexagonal schemes. These schemes also speed up signal propagation from the root to the leaves.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009528/05009532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009528","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Embeddings of Binary Trees in VLSI Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Embeddings of Binary Trees in VLSI Arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-36","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Embeddings of Binary Trees in VLSI Arrays","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n9-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032841S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"5009528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","articleId":"5009532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5009535,"authors":[{"name":"Victor O.

One important problem in DDB research is that of concurrency control. This paper develops a performance model of timestamp-ordering concurrency control algorithms in a DDB.

In this paper we describe the conflict model in detail. We first determine the probability of transaction restarts, the probability of transaction blocking, and the delay due to blocking for the basic timestamp-ordering algorithm.

In this paper, we study the factors that relate to the selection of a cache line size. Our primary focus is on the cache miss ratio, but we also consider influences such as logic complexity, address tags, line crossers, I/O overruns, etc. The behavior of the cache miss ratio as a function of line size is examined carefully through the use of trace driven simulation, using 27 traces from five different machine architectures. The change in cache miss ratio as the line size varies is found to be relatively stable across workloads, and tables of this function are presented for instruction caches, data caches, and unified caches. An empirical mathematical fit is obtained. This function is used to extend previously published design target miss ratios to cover line sizes from 4 to 128 bytes and cache sizes from 32 bytes to 32K bytes; design target miss ratios are to be used to guide new machine designs. Mean delays per memory reference and memory (bus) traffic rates are computed as a function of line and cache size, and memory access time parameters. We find that for high performance microprocessor designs, line sizes in the range 16-64 bytes seem best; shorter line sizes yield high delays due to memory latency, although they reduce memory traffic somewhat. Longer line sizes are suitable for mainframes because of the higher bandwidth to main memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line (Block) Size Choice for CPU Cache Memories","publicationTitle":"IEEE

Furthermore, we propose a novel variation of Fibonacci search, and show that it attains nearly 20 percent better efficiency in average than the ordinary binary search.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.5009548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5009528/05009548.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1135","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.5009548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Search Revisited: Another Advantage of Fibonacci Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Binary Search Revisited: Another Advantage of Fibonacci Search","volume":"C-36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Search Revisited: Another Advantage of Fibonacci Search","sourcePdf":"T-C-vC-36-n9-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023039S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"5009528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5009548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5009631,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The comparisons were made by simulation with an IBM 7094 digital computer with the use of approximately 150,000 samples of actual vehicle telemetry data received during a typical satellite launching, in addition to synthetic telemetry data. The compression techniques discussed employed zero-, first-, and second-order polynomial predictors, or modifications thereof. The results showed that one of the zero-order techniques (one which would be relatively simple to implement) was the most effective in removing redundancy from the data. Although these data were somewhat limited both in scope and quantity, the results tend to support the oft-repeated objection to polynomial predictors that an inordinate amount of emphasis is given to sample points far removed from the point to be predicted, compared to that afforded the most recent samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1965","publicationDate":"March 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","volume":"SET-11","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data Prediction for Telemetry Bandwidth Compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data Prediction for Telemetry Bandwidth Compression","sourcePdf":"T-SET-vSET-11-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032924S","chronDate":"March  1965","isNumber":"5009625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5009633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009635,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuyuki Hiroshige","affiliation":["General Dynamics, Pomona, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Hiroshige","id":"37322490600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-2414"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9539"}],"articleNumber":"5009635","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5009635","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Pi control","Proportional control","Computer errors","Automatic frequency control","Phase detection","Detectors","Logic","Nonlinear equations","Frequency locked loops"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSET.1965.5009635","endPage":"46","startPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/5009625/05009635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1965.5009635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Technique for Improving the Pull-in Capability of Phase-Lock Loops","abstract":"This paper presents a simple technique for improving the pull-in capability of phase-lock loops. This technique, called derived rate rejection or DRR, differs from those which use an external AFC loop in simplicity of implementation and design rationale, although the end result is the same. If, as is usually the case, a coherent detector accompanies the phase-lock loop, the implementation of the DRR technique requires only the addition of a switch. The switching logic results from a superficial consideration of the nonlinear equation for the phase-lock loop and its solution in the phase plane. The switch does not affect the normal behavior of the loop after lock has been attained. Results of computer studies show the improvement realizable for the following configurations: 1) Proportional-plus-integral control. 2) Proportional-plus-imperfect integral control. For an initial frequency error of five times the linearized phase lock-loop natural frequency, the improvement in pull-in time is a factor of two. For an initial frequency error of ten times the phase-lock loop natural frequency, the improvement in pull-in time is a factor of ten.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009635/","volume":"SET-11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1965","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Technique for Improving the Pull-in Capability of Phase-Lock Loops","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Technique for Improving the Pull-in Capability of Phase-Lock Loops","sourcePdf":"T-SET-vSET-11-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038864S","chronDate":"March  1965","isNumber":"5009625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5009635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5009645,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The bandwidth is maintained small and since the operation is generally at frequencies small compared to the bandwidth, the criterion is to keep error as small as possible in this frequency range. A study is made by comparing second- and third-order phase-locked loops designed from Wiener filtering theory, as advanced by Jaffe and Rechtin [1]; considerable improvement in error is evident using a third-order phase-locked loop for frequencies up to about one-twentieth of the bandwidth. To improve the error function still further, a new error-function criterion is established whereby the error at the lower frequencies of interest is minimized. Such a minimum is obtained for both second- and third-order phase-locked loops. Transfer function behavior, transient response, and root locus plots of all these cases are given to emphasize the advantages of this new design. Error is reduced up to six decibels with no degradation of transient response, overshoot, etc. It is shown that the bandwidth can be reduced without increasing the error if the filter designed by this new criterion is used.","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1965.5009645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/5009640/05009645.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1965.5009645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Filters for Second- and Third-Order Phase-Locked Loops by an Error-Function Criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Filters for Second- and Third-Order Phase-Locked Loops by an Error-Function Criterion","volume":"SET-11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1965","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Filters for Second- and Third-Order Phase-Locked Loops by an Error-Function Criterion","sourcePdf":"T-SET-vSET-11-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030581S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"5009640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5009645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5009646,"authors":[{"name":"William B.

For an interferometric system the effect of receiver noise is examined. Then the optimum way to process the received waveforms, and the best spacing for the antennas, is determined. Next, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are determined which must be met to insure that, with a given probability, the final unambiguous measurement is not in error by more than some specified amount.

It has provided measurements to the planetary mean-tracking point with peak minute-to-minute variations less than 2.25 to 3 Km in range. Over a one-hour tracking period, a mean tracking point can be determined to 0.5 km. A scattering-law calibration of the planet is made each day, measuring the mean-tracking-point-to-planetary-surface distance to within 3 km (nominal). The subearth point-to-radar distance is thus measured to a nominal accuracy of 3.5 km. Tracking behaves as a first-order linear ``range-locked'' loop with ephemeris aid, and is practically calibration free. Data obtained during the 1964 conjunction showed that the ephemeris not only contained a range error, but also a range-rate error of 18 km per day. Deviations from this rate correspond to surface features whose height can be estimated. Such data will be invaluable in determining, to a greater degree of accuracy than ever before attainable, the orbital constants of the earth and Venus.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5009640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/5009640/05009648.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1965.5009648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1965.5009648","startPage":"78","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precision Planetary Range-Tracking Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5009648/","displayDocTitle":"A Precision Planetary Range-Tracking Radar","isJournal":true,"volume":"SET-11","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 1965","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precision Planetary Range-Tracking Radar","sourcePdf":"T-SET-vSET-11-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020759S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"5009640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5009648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
