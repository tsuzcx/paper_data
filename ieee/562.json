In this paper, a vision-based high-speed system for the detection of rubber keypad is designed and developed. The system consists of a lighting module, an image acquisition module, a supporting frame, a computer that hosts the detection algorithm and the conveyer belt system. The design of the conveyer belt system ensures that the rubber keypad moved accordingly to the order from the computer, the lighting module ensures the high quality image could be captured.

A non-cooperative game power control algorithm is brought forward in the form of utility function. The proposed game model is in accordance with next top model game by proving, and guarantees the existence of Nash equilibrium power solution in theory, but it will cause that the Nash equilibrium solution isn't satisfied with Pareto optimality due to the selfish and rational behavior of cognitive users, so there are still opportunities to improve on Pareto. Therefore, the validity of Nash equilibrium solution is further improved combining with the definition of cost function.

The fixed structural circuit design indicates that the circuit topology has already been planned and only the component values need to be evolved. The non-fixed structural circuit design indicates that circuit topology and component values need to be evolved simultaneously. Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple and effective optimization method, which has already succeeded in the fixed structural analog circuit design. However, DE method optimizes individuals with the same size, so it is unfit for non-fixed structural analog circuit design. This paper proposes a variable-length differential evolution algorithm (VDE), which can be applied to non-fixed structural analog circuit design. Studies have shown that, GA is a universal and effective optimization method for non-fixed structural evolutionary analog circuit design. In order to investigate the optimization efficiency of VDE, amplifier is regarded as evolving design task which based on VDE method and GA technique respectively. The results show that, the converging speed of VDE is faster than GA and VDE can achieve design objective more efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5618990/05620307.pdf","startPage":"V4-610","endPage":"V4-614","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary design of operational amplifier using variable-length differential evolution algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Hardware","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","genetic algorithms","network topology","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary design","operational amplifier","variable-length differential evolution algorithm","evolutionary analog circuit design","non-fixed structural circuit design","circuit topology","genetic algorithms","optimization efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["differential evolution","variable-length differential evolution","analog circuit design","amplifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary design of operational amplifier using variable-length differential evolution algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5620307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11667222","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary design of operational amplifier using variable-length differential evolution algorithm","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp136vol42654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071565S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5618990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5618990","articleId":"5620307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5620320,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Technology, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China"],"lastName":"Tian Li","id":"37087686356"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620320","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","identification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elman feedback process neural network","learning algorithm","nonlinear system identification problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Elman-style feedback process neural network","Time-varying function","Learning algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620320","abstract":"To address the drawbacks of slow convergenceand low accuracy of Double Parallel Feed-forward ProcessNeural Networks with output as function, an Elman-stylefeedback process neural network model with output as function is proposed.

novel arithmetic coding on data compression and encryption with asymptotic deterministic randomness","abstract":"A novel compression and encryption scheme using variable model arithmetic coding and coupled chaotic system, different from the traditional way which compresses the data first and then encrypts the compressed bit-stream later, can encrypt and compress the input plaintext synchronously. In this paper, an improved scheme using variable interval arithmetic coding and asymptotic deterministic randomness has been proposed. The improved scheme is secure because the key bit-stream generated by the asymptotic deterministic randomness can resist previous attacks against chaotic encryption. In addition, the compression efficiency will not change with the key bit-stream, because the statistical model will no longer be changed. The results show that the new scheme can achieve high compression efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620362/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"11667858","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620362/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel arithmetic coding on data compression and encryption with asymptotic deterministic randomness","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel arithmetic coding on data compression and encryption with asymptotic deterministic randomness","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp008vol20785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056597S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5618993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","xplore-issue":"5618993","articleId":"5620362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5620364,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer Forensics, Shandong Computer Science Center, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Lei Zhang","id":"37087164989"},{"name":"Dong Zhang","affiliation":["Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Dong Zhang","id":"37087215949"},{"name":"Lianhai Wang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer Forensics, Shandong Computer Science Center, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Lianhai Wang","id":"37087192676"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620364","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1336},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620364","abstract":"Traditional computer forensics is performed towards physical machines, using a set of forensic tools to acquire disk images and memory dumps.

Conventional cooperative scheme assumes that all cooperative secondary users spend the same duration on sensing, sensing results are then reported to the fusion center sequentially. With the number of cooperative users growing, the more data needs to be reported to a fusion center, thus the more reporting time overhead would be consumed. However, reporting of sensing results just consumes reporting time overhead and has no contribution to the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a superposition-based cooperative spectrum sensing framework. It combines spectrum sensing duration and results reporting duration to sense. Each cooperative user adopts a different sensing duration because they are superposed on different reporting durations. The proposed framework makes cooperative spectrum sensing in a more accurate way without adding extra expected time overhead. Compared with the conventional cooperative scheme, simulation results indicate that significant detection performance enhancements may be achieved through our proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11667265","htmlLink":"/document/5620371/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Superposition-based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superposition-based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp080vol42329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.162774S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5618990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5618990","articleId":"5620371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5620412,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Qin","affiliation":["Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yi Qin","id":"37597321800"},{"name":"Shitan Huang","affiliation":["Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Shitan Huang","id":"37597216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620412","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620412","abstract":"To solve the traditional fault diagnosis can not be adapted to the complicated system, a kind of new multi-sensor fusion fault diagnosis method is presented.

To mitigate the effect of cochannel interference CCI while satisfying required quality of service, the power level on each subchannel of OFDM systems should be allocated to and controlled at an optimum level. A conventional approach to OFDM power allocation system design is to maintain the same link quality for all subchannels. This simple scheme requires high power consumption and deteriorates control stability and convergence properties. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approach, a new power control scheme is proposed.

With the instantaneous channel state information at the receiver of each relay, we drive the optimal relay selection scheme which is jointly with optimum power allocation policies, and can be implemented in a distributed way. Since the power allocation to each subcarrier affects the final result of relay selection, the optimal power allocation intra subcarrier pair and all-around optimal power allocation are proposed. We demonstrate that the proposed relay selection scheme achieves M orders of diversity, where M is the number of the potential relays.

Due to the low efficiency of the traditional bus-based structure of System-on-Chip (SoC), Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is emerging as a predominant substitute for interconnection in SoC. Meanwhile, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique has becoming a popular research topic in the thriving wireless mobile communication area. This paper proposes how to implement OFDM system on a NoC platform, which is composed by 4\u00d74 2-D mesh tiles in Xilinx Virtex-IV FPGA arrays. Wormhole switching, deterministic routing and Virtual Output Queuing (VOQ) mechanism are adopted in the switch and router design.

This hybrid strategy can work out these problems in image segmentation of gold immunochromatographic test strip: the area of test strip is pretty small; the breadth of test line testing zone, control line testing zone will not be fixed due to the reaction between samples and test strip. Computer simulation on this hybrid strategy is realized by Visual C++. The results of computer simulation demonstrate that, comparing with the EBP algorithm, the convergence precision and training speed of the EBP neural network can be improved due to the parameters produced from GSAA. Furthermore, comparing with EBP algorithm, the convergence precision and convergence speed of GSAA is much better. At the end of this paper, this hybrid strategy is applied to image segmentation of test strip and get satisfactory effect.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620535","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5618990/05620535.pdf","startPage":"V4-19","endPage":"V4-23","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved hybrid strategy combining genetic simulated annealing algorithm and EBP used for image segmentation of test strip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An improved hybrid strategy combining genetic simulated annealing algorithm and EBP used for image segmentation of test strip","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11667185","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5620535/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved hybrid strategy combining genetic simulated annealing algorithm and EBP used for image segmentation of test strip","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp010vol41947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079125S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5618990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5618990","articleId":"5620535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5620538,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-ran Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Xin-ran","lastName":"Li","id":"38272833600"},{"name":"Jin Yan-xia","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Instrumentation Science and Dynamic Measurement, North University of China, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Jin Yan-xia","id":"38274163600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620538","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Optimization","Fractals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network design","chaos particle swarm optimization","discrete binary particle swarm optimization","neural network training arithmetic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620538","abstract":"Utilizing the optimizing capability of PSO arithmetic, this paper makes use of the united arithmetic of chaos particle swarm optimization and discrete binary particle swarm optimization simultaneously processing parameters of joint structure of neural network and connective power.

To adapt to display device, High Dynamic Range (HDR) image should be converted into Low Dynamic Range (LDR) image. A common task of tone mapping algorithms is to reproduce high dynamic range images on low dynamic range display devices. In this paper, a new tone mapping algorithm is proposed for high dynamic range images. Based on the probabilistic model is proposed for high dynamic image's tone reproduction, the proposed method uses a logarithmic normal distribution instead of normal distribution. Therefore, the algorithm can preserve visibility and contrast impression of high dynamic range scenes in the common display devices.

Therefore, that whether user behavior is trusted, how to evaluate user behavior trust is an important research content in cloud computing. mainly discusses evaluation importance of user behavior trust and evaluation strategy, in the cloud computing, including trust object analysis, principle on evaluating user behavior trust, basic idea of evaluating user behavior trust, evaluation strategy of behavior trust for each access, and long access, which laid the theoretical foundation about trust for the practical cloud computing application.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620636","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5618996/05620636.pdf","startPage":"V7-567","endPage":"V7-572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of user behavior trust in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620636/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of user behavior trust in cloud computing","volume":"7","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11640062","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620636/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of user behavior trust in cloud computing","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp138vol70694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061435S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5618996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5618996","articleId":"5620636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5620645,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofen Wang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Computer Network & Information Security, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofen Wang","id":"37601034700"},{"name":"Liaojun Pang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Computer Network & Information Security, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Liaojun","lastName":"Pang","id":"37589230400"},{"name":"Qingqi Pei","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Computer Network & Information Security, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Qingqi Pei","id":"37294380000"},{"name":"Xuejun Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Computer Network & Information Security, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Xuejun Li","id":"37600387100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620645","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":502},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","iterative methods","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast network traffic anomaly detection","network security","iterative estimation","Hurst parameter","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Fast","Hurst","Iteration"]}],"abstract":"Fast network traffic anomaly detection is an important issue in network security. At present, the Internet environment becomes more and more complex than ever before. The unexpected anomaly occurs constantly, which brings great loss to Internet services. This makes people put forward higher requirements for the speed and real-time of network traffic anomaly detection. How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation. Meanwhile, by on-line we can estimate continuously and refresh the value of Hurst according to the latest network traffic, and then we can get the latest traffic data and speed up the process of anomaly detection. Analyses show that this scheme is effective in fast anomaly detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620645","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5619023/05620645.pdf","startPage":"V1-592","endPage":"V1-596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5619023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scheme for fast network traffic anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620645/","displayDocTitle":"A scheme for fast network traffic anomaly detection","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11667629","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620645/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scheme for fast network traffic anomaly detection","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp137vol10703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050711S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5619023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5619023","articleId":"5620645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5620720,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Shao","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Shao","id":"37587897200"},{"name":"Xin Liang","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xin Liang","id":"37599827100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5620720","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Broadband antennas","Broadband communication","Field programmable gate arrays","Monitoring","Arrays","Industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio model","FPGA","intelligence wireless communication technology","physical layer","RFFE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CR","FPGA","DSP","RFFE","Radio Frequency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designment and implementation of cognitive radio model based on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618993","endPage":"V2-418","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5618993/05620720.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620720","startPage":"V2-415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620720","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is an emerging intelligence wireless communication technology now.

We developed a prototype that supports military mechanics conducting routine maintenance tasks inside an armored vehicle turret, and evaluated it with a user study. Our prototype uses a tracked headworn display to augment a mechanic's natural view with text, labels, arrows, and animated sequences designed to facilitate task comprehension, localization, and execution. A within-subject controlled user study examined professional military mechanics using our system to complete 18 common tasks under field conditions. These tasks included installing and removing fasteners and indicator lights, and connecting cables, all within the cramped interior of an armored personnel carrier turret. An augmented reality condition was tested against two baseline conditions: the same headworn display providing untracked text and graphics and a fixed flat panel display representing an improved version of the laptop-based documentation currently employed in practice. The augmented reality condition allowed mechanics to locate tasks more quickly than when using either baseline, and in some instances, resulted in less overall head movement. A qualitative survey showed that mechanics found the augmented reality condition intuitive and satisfying for the tested sequence of tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5976480/05620905.pdf","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the Benefits of Augmented Reality Documentation for Maintenance and Repair","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the Benefits of Augmented Reality Documentation for Maintenance and Repair","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620905/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205297","pubMedId":"21041888","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620905/","volume":"17","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the Benefits of Augmented Reality Documentation for Maintenance and Repair","sourcePdf":"ttg2011101355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084023S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5976480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"5976480","articleId":"5620905","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5620915,"authors":[{"name":"Dengyao Mo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dengyao","lastName":"Mo","id":"37604091500"},{"name":"Samuel H.

Intrinsic dimension indicates the number of variables necessary to describe a data set. Two methods, box-counting dimension and correlation dimension, are commonly used for intrinsic dimension estimation. However, the robustness of these two methods has not been rigorously studied. This paper demonstrates that correlation dimension is more robust with respect to data sample size. In addition, instead of using a user selected distance d, we propose a new approach to capture all log-log pairs of a data set to more precisely estimate the correlation dimension. Systematic experiments are conducted to study factors that influence the computation of correlation dimension, including sample size, the number of redundant variables, and the portion of log-log plot used for calculation. Experiments on real-world data sets confirm the effectiveness of intrinsic dimension estimation with our improved method. Furthermore, a new supervised dimensionality reduction method based on intrinsic dimension estimation was introduced and validated.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.225","startPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6084775/05620915.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.225","endPage":"71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractal-Based Intrinsic Dimension Estimation and Its Application in Dimensionality Reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Fractal-Based Intrinsic Dimension Estimation and Its Application in Dimensionality Reduction","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5620915/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12376743","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal-Based Intrinsic Dimension Estimation and Its Application in Dimensionality Reduction","sourcePdf":"ttk2012010059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031739S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","isNumber":"6084775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"25","articleId":"5620915","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5620917,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Martinez Alvarez","affiliation":["Pablo de Olavide University, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5898452/5620917/5620917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francisco Mart\u00ednez \u00c1lvarez received the MSc degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Seville, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from the Pablo de Olavide University.

First, clustering techniques are used with the aim of grouping and labeling the samples from a data set. Thus, the prediction of a data point is provided as follows: first, the pattern sequence prior to the day to be predicted is extracted. Then, this sequence is searched in the historical data and the prediction is calculated by averaging all the samples immediately after the matched sequence. The main novelty is that only the labels associated with each pattern are considered to forecast the future behavior of the time series, avoiding the use of real values of the time series until the last step of the prediction process. Results from several energy time series are reported and the performance of the proposed method is compared to that of recently published techniques showing a remarkable improvement in the prediction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern clustering","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy time series forecasting","pattern sequence similarity","clustering techniques","data point prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time series","forecasting","patterns."]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.227","startPage":"1230","endPage":"1243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5898452/05620917.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Time Series Forecasting Based on Pattern Sequence Similarity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy Time Series Forecasting Based on Pattern Sequence Similarity","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12063420","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","volume":"23","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620917/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Time Series Forecasting Based on Pattern Sequence Similarity","sourcePdf":"ttk2011081230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09951S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5898452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5898452","articleId":"5620917","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5620920,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elsalih Mahmoud","affiliation":["Electrical communications engineering, Banha University, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5962742/5620920/5620920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Elsalih Mahmoud received the BSc and MSc degrees (with honors) in electrical communications engineering from Banha University, Cairo, Egypt, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.

Incentive protocols use credits to stimulate the selfish nodes' cooperation, but the existing protocols usually rely on the heavyweight public-key operations to secure the payment. In this paper, we propose secure cooperation incentive protocol that uses the public-key operations only for the first packet in a series and uses the lightweight hashing operations in the next packets, so that the overhead of the packet series converges to that of the hashing operations. Hash chains and keyed hash values are used to achieve payment nonrepudiation and thwart free riding attacks. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed protocol is secure and the overhead is incomparable to the public-key-based incentive protocols because the efficient hashing operations dominate the nodes' operations. Moreover, the average packet overhead is less than those of the public-key-based protocols with very high probability due to truncating the keyed hash values.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5962742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5962742/05620920.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.211","startPage":"997","endPage":"1010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ESIP: Secure Incentive Protocol with Limited Use of Public-Key Cryptography for Multihop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620920/","displayDocTitle":"ESIP: Secure Incentive Protocol with Limited Use of Public-Key Cryptography for Multihop Wireless Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620920/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12136729","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ESIP: Secure Incentive Protocol with Limited Use of Public-Key Cryptography for Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011070997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125402S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5962742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5962742","articleId":"5620920","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5620924,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic Petrot","affiliation":["CNRS/Grenoble INP/UJF, TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric P\u00e9trot is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Grenoble Institute of Technology and heads the System Level Synthesis Group at TIMA Laboratory in Grenoble, France.

The receiver macro consists of 22 data channels plus one forwarded-clock channel, and supports both differential and ground termination. A pulsed CDR with programmable bandwidth is implemented to save power in the CDR. Time dithering is applied to the CDR to avoid notches in the jitter tolerance curve. The receiver clock path incorporates both a clean-up PLL and a polyphase filter for RX clock generation, from which one can be chosen to generate the receive clock. It is shown how jitter in a source-synchronous link is related to skew between clock and data, as well as cross-talk from the data to the clock wires. The jitter performance of the RX using either the polyphase filter or the PLL for clock generation is compared for different loop bandwidths. The RX core was implemented in a 65 nm Bulk CMOS technology. Total power consumption for the 22+1 lane RX PHY core running at 6.4 Gbps with the polyphase filter and in pulsed CDR mode is 635 mW or 4.5 mW/Gbps.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5625049/05620927.pdf","startPage":"2850","endPage":"2860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2077350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2077350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4.5 mW/Gb/s 6.4 Gb/s 22+1-Lane Source Synchronous Receiver Core With Optional Cleanup PLL in 65 nm CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Phase locked loops","Jitter","Noise","Receivers","Bandwidth","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","filters","jitter","phase locked loops","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source synchronous receiver macro","phase locked loops","CMOS technology","forwarded-clock channel","differential termination","ground termination","CDR circuits","time dithering","jitter tolerance curve","receiver clock path","polyphase filter","size 65 nm","bit rate 3.2 Gbit/s to 6.4 Gbit/s","power 635 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-speed serial links","clock generation","clock and data recovery","CDR","source-synchronous link","jitter","polyphase filter","phase-locked loop","PLL","BIST","cross-talk","X-talk","forwarded clock"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 4.5 mW/Gb/s 6.4 Gb/s 22+1-Lane Source Synchronous Receiver Core With Optional Cleanup PLL in 65 nm CMOS","volume":"45","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5620927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684807","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4.5 mW/Gb/s 6.4 Gb/s 22+1-Lane Source Synchronous Receiver Core With Optional Cleanup PLL in 65 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-toifl-2077350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057918S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5625049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5625049","articleId":"5620927","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5620928,"authors":[{"name":"Eddy Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/5635427/5620928/5620928-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eddy Chiu (S'08) received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, both in Electrical Engineering.

In previous works on MIMO multicast transmit precoding design, the authors either assumed (1) perfect transmitter-side channel state information (CSIT) or (2) special channel conditions that facilitate precoder design with imperfect CSIT. In this paper, we focus on transmit precoding design for MBS where the CSIT is obtained via limited feedback. In addition, we analyze the average minimum receive signal-noise-ratio (RxSNR) among the MBS users and study the order of growth with respect to the number of MBS users, the number of feedback bits, and the number of transmit antennas.

The spectrum allocated to femtocells is traditionally from the same licensed spectrum bands of macrocells. In this case, the capacity of femtocell networks is highly limited due to the finite number of licensed spectrum bands and also the interference with macrocells and other femtocells. In this paper, we propose a radically new communication paradigm by incorporating cognitive radio in femtocell networks. The cognitive radio enabled femtocells are able to access spectrum bands not only from macrocells but also from other licensed systems (e.g. TV systems) provided the interference from femtocells to the existing systems is not harmful. It results in more channel opportunities for femtocells. Thus, the co-channel interference in femtocells can be greatly reduced and the network capacity can be significantly improved. Because of the difference from other traditional wireless networks, we argue the traditional spectrum sharing schemes such as coloring methods are not efficient to femtocell networks especially for dense deployment scenarios. We formulate the downlink spectrum sharing problem in cognitive radio femtocell networks, and employ decomposition theories to solve the problem. Simulation results indicate that cognitive radio enabled femtocells could achieve much higher capacity than the femtocell networks which do not employ agile spectrum access. Simulation results also show that our proposed scheme without any iteration can achieve almost twice of the average capacity by coloring method when the number of available channels is less than five. Moreover, our proposed scheme can converge very fast with a typical value of only five iterations, and it can achieve around two percent extra average capacity than the fixed power control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620930/","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5620930/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11661377","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Spectrum Sharing for Cognitive Radio Femtocell Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Spectrum Sharing for Cognitive Radio Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-xiang-2083230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126666S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5635427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5635427","articleId":"5620930","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5620933,"authors":[{"name":"Jan De Caigny","affiliation":["The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/5672500/5620933/5620933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jan De Caigny was born in Kapellen, Belgium, in 1982.

The SMILE technique is based on the interpolation of linear time-invariant models estimated for constant values of the scheduling parameters. As the linear time-invariant models can be either continuous- or discrete-time, both continuous- and discrete-time LPV models can be obtained. The underlying interpolation technique is formulated as a linear least-squares problem that can be efficiently solved. The proposed technique yields homogeneous polynomial LPV models in the multi-simplex that are numerically well-conditioned and therefore suitable for LPV control synthesis. The potential of the SMILE technique is demonstrated by computing a continuous-time interpolating LPV model for an analytic mass-spring-damper system and a discrete-time interpolating LPV model for a mechatronic -motion system based on experimental data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11704274","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620933/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation-Based Modeling of MIMO LPV Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation-Based Modeling of MIMO LPV Systems","sourcePdf":"tcst-decaigny-2078509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104573S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5672500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5672500","articleId":"5620933","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5620938,"authors":[{"name":"Chieh-Hsun Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662240/5620938/5620938-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chieh-Hsun Hsiao (S'10) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on June 5, 1984.

By using this method, the power divider could be designed to be arbitrary-way (N-way) with arbitrary power division, and arbitrary dual-band operations in a pure planar structure. A previous dual-band unequal Wilkinson power divider is extended to arbitrary terminal impedances case, thus, it can be used to construct multiway planar power dividers through the combination of the two-section dual-frequency transformers. To obtain three-way (or any odd-way) power dividers with dual-band and unequal power division features, a new developed recombinant structure is employed. This recombinant structure consists of a two-way dual-band unequal power divider/combiner without any isolation structures. Furthermore, the complete design procedures and analytical equations of these proposed generalized power dividers are presented. To verify our proposed design approach in theory, several three-way and four-way power dividers with different dual-band applications and various power divisions are designed and simulated. Finally, a practical three-way power divider operating at both 0.6 and 2.45 GHz with a power dividing ratio of 3:5:1 is fabricated in microstrip technology as a typical example. The measured results of the fabricated power divider verify our proposed idea.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Design Method of Multiway Dual-Band Planar Power Dividers With Arbitrary Power Division","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2086712","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5662237/05620940.pdf","startPage":"3832","endPage":"3841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2086712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Design Method of Multiway Dual-Band Planar Power Dividers With Arbitrary Power Division","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5620940/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692670","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Design Method of Multiway Dual-Band Planar Power Dividers With Arbitrary Power Division","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wu-2086712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094535S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5662237","articleId":"5620940","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5620947,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5673376/5620947/5620947-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Cui (S'10) was born in Shaanxi Province, China, in 1985.

Since it is difficult to obtain accurate phasor results in fast transient situations, most of the feeder relays fail to correctly respond to transient/intermittent earth faults, which are, however, frequent fault cases in distribution systems. This paper presents a novel approach for fault detection and direction determination for these transient/intermittent faults. The basic idea is to extract the fault direction using the instantaneous power's direction. The instantaneous power is obtained by using Hilbert transform. The proposed direction element inherently utilizes the high-frequency components of the transient fault signals at a conventional sampling rate. Together with an intermittence detection algorithm, a scheme for transient/intermittent earth fault detection has been proposed. It has been implemented as a prototype relay. Electromagnetic Transients Program tests as well as physical model tests have proved the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2068578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

The effect of the EML modulation nonlinearities on the OFDM subcarriers in MB-OFDM UWB over fiber system is investigated considering intermodulation distortion (IMD) and adjacent channel power ratio. It is shown that MB-OFDM UWB over fiber is limited by SNR for small modulation power and EML modulation nonlinearities induced IMD for high modulation power. Fiber transmission length is mainly degraded by EML phase noise converted relative intensity noise and power fading. The developed theory is verified by experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5648775/05620954.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3555","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2090942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2090942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Electro-Absorption Modulator Integrated Laser on MB-OFDM Ultra-Wideband Signals Over Fiber Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber dispersion","Modulation","OFDM","Optical fiber amplifiers","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro absorption modulator","integrated laser","MB-OFDM ultrawideband signals","fiber length","bias voltage","modulation power","bias current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber-optic communications","multiband-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM)","RF photonics","radio over fiber (RoF)","ultra wideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Electro-Absorption Modulator Integrated Laser on MB-OFDM Ultra-Wideband Signals Over Fiber Systems","volume":"28","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/5620954/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11684902","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Electro-Absorption Modulator Integrated Laser on MB-OFDM Ultra-Wideband Signals Over Fiber Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2090942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057685S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5648775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5648775","articleId":"5620954","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5620958,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For SHEPWM, a novel formula is proposed to obtain the initial values of switching angles, leading to another valid solution that is different from the known ones in the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that, by eliminating the quarter-wave symmetry, unlimited groups of solutions to three-level SHEPWM can be obtained. The characteristics of the multiple solutions in terms of harmonic distribution, pulsewidth, and total harmonic distortion are investigated for the application of SHE in practical drives. Switching between SVPWM and SHEPWM is problematic if no appropriate measure is taken, particularly when the influence of the minimum pulsewidth (MPW) is considerable. A simple but effective method, taking into account the MPW, is proposed in this paper to address this problem. The multiple groups of solutions to SHE are simulated and experimentally verified on a low-voltage three-level NPC inverter prototype. Experimental results obtained from a low-voltage prototype and an industrial 6-kV/1250-kW three-level drive are presented to validate the smooth switching between SVPWM and SHEPWM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Space vector pulse width modulation","Inverters","Switches","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","induction motor drives","PWM invertors","switching convertors","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power three-level inverter-fed induction-motor drives","space-vector PWM","selective harmonic elimination","three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter","switching angles","quarter-wave symmetry","harmonic distribution","total harmonic distortion","minimum pulsewidth","low-voltage three-level NPC inverter prototype"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","selective harmonic elimination","space-vector modulation","three-level inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2090836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5947747/05620978.pdf","startPage":"3409","endPage":"3420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5947747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2090836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid PWM Applied to High-Power Three-Level Inverter-Fed Induction-Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5620978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid PWM Applied to High-Power Three-Level Inverter-Fed Induction-Motor Drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620978/","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5620978/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12157710","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid PWM Applied to High-Power Three-Level Inverter-Fed Induction-Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2090836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178219S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5947747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5947747","articleId":"5620978","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5620979,"authors":[{"name":"Kurt Barb\u00e9","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5710177/5620979/5620979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kurt Barb\u00e9 was born in Aalst on April 25, 1983.

Specifically, in the spectrum sensing phase, only selected cognitive relays are utilized to transmit/forward their initial detection results (without a dedicated sensing relay channel) to a cognitive source for fusion, where the dedicated sensing channel refers to the channel transmitting initial spectrum sensing results from cognitive relays to the cognitive source. In the data transmission phase, only the best relay is selected to assist the cognitive source for its data transmissions. By jointly considering the two phases, we derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for the SRSS-BRDT scheme over Rayleigh fading channels. We show that the SRSS-BRDT scheme outperforms the traditional cognitive transmission scheme (with a limited dedicated sensing channel) in terms of the outage probability performance. In addition, numerical results illustrate that the outage probability of the SRSS-BRDT scheme can be minimized through an optimal allocation of the time durations between the spectrum sensing and data transmission phases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5620988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742859","htmlLink":"/document/5620988/","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Sensing Based Cognitive Relay Transmission Scheme Without a Dedicated Sensing Relay Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Sensing Based Cognitive Relay Transmission Scheme Without a Dedicated Sensing Relay Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-yao-2090876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132864S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5620988","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5620991,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Le Nir","affiliation":["Department of Communication, Information Systems and Sensors, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Le Nir","id":"37269775200"},{"name":"Bart Scheers","affiliation":["Department of Communication, Information Systems and Sensors, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Scheers","id":"37374340500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5620991","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Resource management","Minimization","Receivers","Equations","Simulation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","optimisation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","parallel Gaussian MIMO wire-tap channels","multiple-input multiple-output channels","mathematical derivations","secrecy rate maximization","power minimization","single-input single-output system","SISO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","optimization methods","wire-tap channel"]}],"abstract":"Wire-tap channels are able to provide perfect secrecy when a receiver exhibits a better channel than its wire-tapping opponent.

Intra-die variation causes a statistical distribution of DRV for individual cells in a memory array. We present two fast and accurate methods to estimate the tail of the DRV distribution. The first method uses a new analytical model based on the relationship between DRV and static noise margin. The second method extends the statistical blockade technique to a recursive formulation. It uses conditional sampling for rapid statistical simulation and fits the results to a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model.

The first algorithm has two unique features: 1) a satisfiability problem (SAT) instance was devised so that an unsuccessful rewiring can be identified very quickly, and 2) unlike binary decision diagram-based methods that require all pairs of SPFD, our algorithm uses a few SAT instances to perform rewiring for a given wire without explicitly enumerating all SPFDs. Experimental results show that the runtime of our algorithm is about three times faster than that of a conventional one under a simulated setting of such a framework and it scales well with the number of candidate wires considered. The efficacy of the framework can be further improved by the second proposed algorithm. The algorithm relies on a theory presented herein to allow adding a new wire outside of the restricted set of dominator nodes, a feature common in automatic-test-pattern-generation-based rewiring, but absent in existing SPFD-based ones. Although this algorithm may suffer from long runtimes in the same way conventional SPFD-based techniques do, experiments show that the number of wires which can be rewired increases 13% on average and the number of alternative wires also increases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements on Efficiency and Efficacy of SPFD-Based Rewiring for LUT-Based Circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061750","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5621029/05621036.pdf","startPage":"1870","endPage":"1883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Improvements on Efficiency and Efficacy of SPFD-Based Rewiring for LUT-Based Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5621036/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements on Efficiency and Efficacy of SPFD-Based Rewiring for LUT-Based Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-maidee-2061750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10414S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5621029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"5621029","articleId":"5621036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5621041,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjie Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5621029/5621041/5621041-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingjie Lin (M'08) received the B.S. degree in engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2008.","From 2008 to 2009, he was with a FPGA startup, Tabula, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, as a Senior Engineer.

For embedded memories, built-in redundancy analysis (BIRA) is widely used to solve quality and yield issues by replacing faulty cells with healthy redundant cells. Many BIRA approaches require extra hardware overhead in order to achieve optimal repair rates, or they suffer a loss of repair rate in minimizing the hardware overhead. An innovative BIRA approach is proposed to achieve optimal repair rates, lower area overhead, and increase analysis speed. The proposed BIRA minimizes area overhead by eliminating some storage coverage for only must-repair faulty information. The proposed BIRA analyzes redundancies quickly and efficiently by evaluating all nodes of a branch in parallel with a new analyzer which is simple and easy-to-implement. Experimental results show that the proposed BIRA allows for a much faster analysis speed than that of the state-of-the-art BIRA, as well as the optimal repair rate, and relatively small area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2062830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5621029/05621043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2062830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621029","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Advanced BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate and Fast Analysis Speed by Using a Branch Analyzer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Advanced BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate and Fast Analysis Speed by Using a Branch Analyzer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655528","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5621043/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Advanced BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate and Fast Analysis Speed by Using a Branch Analyzer","sourcePdf":"tcad-kang-2062830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065352S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5621029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5621029","articleId":"5621043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5621044,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5621029/5621044/5621044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangyu Dong (S'09) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.

The majority of the existing 3-D integrated circuit (IC) research is focused on the performance, power, density, and heterogeneous integration benefits offered by 3-D integration. All such advantages, however, ultimately have to translate into cost evaluation when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, system-level cost analysis at early design stages is imperative to decide on whether 3-D integration should be adopted. This paper presents a cost estimation method for 3-D ICs at early design stages and proposes a set of cost models that include wafer cost, 3-D bonding cost, package cost, and cooling cost. The proposed 3-D IC cost estimation method can help designers analyze the cost implication for 3-D ICs during the design space exploration at the early stage, and it enables a cost-driven 3-D IC design flow that can guide the design choice toward a cost-effective direction. Based on the proposed cost estimation method, this paper demonstrates two case studies that explore the cost benefits of 3-D integration for application-specific integrated circuit designs and many-core microprocessor designs style, respectively. Finally, this paper suggests the optimum partitioning strategy for future 3-D IC designs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1972","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2062811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2062811","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5621029/05621044.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication Cost Analysis and Cost-Aware Design Space Exploration for 3-D ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621044/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication Cost Analysis and Cost-Aware Design Space Exploration for 3-D ICs","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655529","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5621044/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication Cost Analysis and Cost-Aware Design Space Exploration for 3-D ICs","sourcePdf":"tcad-dong-2062811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116678S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5621029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5621029","articleId":"5621044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5621086,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The CRoF architecture is based on connecting the core CRoF system at the macrocell BS to the terminals of various microcells using the RoF. The terminals can be short-range transmission stations or just bridges that connect microcells wirelessly to the CRoF headquarters. This article gives a brief description for the future working schemes of each of the proposed CRoF implementation scenarios. Opnet simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of different CRoF designs in coexistence with the primary network. Results show the dominance of the CRoF implementation using multiple, small, fixed radios,and connected via fiber over all other CRoF designed, and traditional CR management systems. The CRoF system is proposed for future applications in CMNs.

This article describes an effort toward developing a railroad-specific cognitive radio (rail-CR) that can meet the needs of future wireless communication systems for railways by making positive train control (PTC) communication more interoperable, robust, reliable, spectrally efficient, and less costly to deploy and maintain. Cognitive radios (CRs) are a cutting-edge research area that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with software-defined radios (SDRs) with the goal of improving upon existing radio performance. SDRs are radios in which capabilities are flexible because of realizing some functionality in software as opposed to a purely hardware platform. By using situational awareness from the radio in the form of observable parameters, often known as meters, a cognitive engine (CE) uses software-based decision-making and learning algorithms to determine whether a change in the radio parameters, commonly referred to as knobs, is required based on sets of predefined goals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10209/5621595/05621621.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2010.938275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2010.938275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Railway Cognitive Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rail transportation","Wireless communication","Frequency modulation","Decision making","Artificial intelligence","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile communication","railway engineering","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["railway cognitive radio","wireless communication","railroad operations","positive train control","artificial intelligence","software-defined radios","situational awareness","cognitive engine","software-based decision-making","learning algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Railway Cognitive Radio","volume":"5","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5621621/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629455","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Railway Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"05mvt03-amanna.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075939S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"5621595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5621595","articleId":"5621621","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5621719,"authors":[{"name":"Enxiu Chen","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, Shandong Institute of Commerce and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Enxiu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596009800"},{"name":"Zhenliang Pan","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, Shandong Institute of Commerce and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenliang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37597544900"},{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, Shandong Institute of Commerce and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597394500"},{"name":"Xiyu Liu","affiliation":["School of Management & Economics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xiyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406534700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7576-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7575-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4116-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5621719","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621719","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Minimization","Equations","Optimization","Generators","Finite element methods","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportion probability","binary particle swarm optimization","computational intelligence","binary PSO","continuous PSO","discrete PSO","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","Discrete Optimization","Proportion probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIFE.2010.14","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620886/5621704/05621719.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","startPage":"15","endPage":"19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIFE.2010.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Proportion Probability","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO), as a novel computational intelligence technique, has succeeded in many continuous problems. But in discrete or binary version there are still some difficulties. In this paper a novel binary PSO is proposed. This algorithm proposes a new definition for the position vector of binary PSO. The probability of a certain particle element assuming a value of 0 or 1 is positive proportional to values 0s or 1s of this element in the current position of the particle, the historic best position it experienced, and the best point found by the whole swarm, but negative proportional to value of the former position of the particle, which determines the next movement of the particle. It will be shown that this algorithm is a better interpretation of continuous PSO into discrete PSO than the older versions. Also a number of benchmark optimization problems are solved using this concept and quite satisfactory results are obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621719/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11630474","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621719/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Proportion Probability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Proportion Probability","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4116a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059554S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620886","isNumber":"5621704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620886","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5621704","articleId":"5621719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5621727,"authors":[{"name":"Sulin Pang","affiliation":["Department of Accountancy & Institute of Finance Engineering, School of Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Sulin","lastName":"Pang","id":"37337910200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7576-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7575-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4116-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5621727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Companies","Fuzzy neural networks","Classification algorithms","Biological system modeling","Training","Input variables","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["credit transactions","fuzzy neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["credit evaluation model","fuzzy neural network","patterns classification","earning per share","net asset value per share","return on equity","cash flow per share"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","credit evaluation model","pattern classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIFE.2010.22","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620886/5621704/05621727.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIFE.2010.22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credit Evaluation Model and Application Based on Fuzzy Neural Network","abstract":"The research establishes a credit evaluation model based on fuzzy neural network.

By analyzing the statistical quantities of every variable of both the training samples and the testing samples, after eliminating 22 abnormal samples, and then only analyzing 84 normal samples. The simulation results show that the credit evaluation model based on fuzzy neural network has high discriminate accuracy rate to those rest normal samples. There is only one misjudge sample.

Forecasting accuracy is one of the most important factors involved in selecting a forecasting method. Besides, nowadays artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming more and more widespread because of their accuracy, symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. Among these techniques, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the best AI techniques for optimization and parameter estimation. In this study a PSO-based time series model for the gold price forecasting is proposed that uses PSO algorithm for parameter estimation. We evaluate capability of the proposed model by applying it on daily observation of gold price and compare the outcomes with previous methods using mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that the proposed approach is able to cope with the fluctuations of gold price time series and it also yields good prediction accuracy, so it can be considered as a suitable tool for financial forecasting problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621830/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11630418","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621830/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Developing a Time Series Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Gold Price Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a Time Series Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Gold Price Forecasting","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4116a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099894S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620886","isNumber":"5621704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620886","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5621704","articleId":"5621830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5621842,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Dighe","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5673672/5621842/5621842-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saurabh Dighe (M'05) received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 2003.","He was with Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, working on front-end logic and validation methodologies for the Itanium processor and the Core processor design team Currently he is a member of the Advanced Microprocessor Research team at Intel Labs, Hillsboro, Oregon, involved in the definition, implementation and validation of future Tera-scale computing technologies like the Intel Teraflops processor and 48-Core IA-32 Message Passing Processor.

The ADWLUD sensor enables 130 mV reduction in SRAM Vccmin while increasing frequency yield by 9% over conventional SRAM without WLUD. The sensor area overhead is limited to 0.02% and power overhead is 2% for a 3.4 Mb SRAM array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621844/","volume":"46","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5621844/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704568","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 32 nm High-k Metal Gate SRAM With Adaptive Dynamic Stability Enhancement for Low-Voltage Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32 nm High-k Metal Gate SRAM With Adaptive Dynamic Stability Enhancement for Low-Voltage Operation","sourcePdf":"jssc-kolar-2084490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088973S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5621844","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5621876,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Yoshioka","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5643253/5621876/5621876-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masato Yoshioka received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan, in 1996 and 1998, respectively.","He joined Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., Kawasaki, Japan, in 1998, where he has been engaged in the research and development of high-performance analog-to-digital converters."]},"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Yoshioka","id":"37535041800"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Ishikawa","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5643253/5621876/5621876-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kiyoshi Ishikawa received the B.S. degree in applied physics from Toukai University, Kanagawa, Japan, in 1992.","In 2005, he joined Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan.

The WFSC generates the active power references for the low-layer WTG controllers according to the active power demand from or generation commitment to the grid operator; the low-layer WTG controllers then regulate each DFIG wind turbine to generate the desired amount of active power, where the deviations between the available wind energy input and desired active power output are compensated by the ESS.

These very flexible and rather easy to manufacture inductors appear very attractive for compact high-frequency dc-dc converters where high efficiency, low volume, and low noise are of primary concern.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2090902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975345","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1846","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5975345/05621918.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2090902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Shielded PCB Air-Core Toroids for High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Solenoids","Magnetic fields","Resistance","Magnetic flux","Converters","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","machine windings","magnetic shielding","power engineering computing","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shielded PCB air-core toroids","high-efficiency dc-dc converters","printed circuit board","ac winding resistance","dc winding resistance","ANSOFT Q3D simulation tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Air-core inductors","dc\u2013dc converters","electromagnetic interference reduction","magnetic shielding","printed circuit board (PCB) inductors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Shielded PCB Air-Core Toroids for High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5621918/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205326","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Shielded PCB Air-Core Toroids for High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-orlandi-2090902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064184S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5975345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5975345","articleId":"5621918","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5621929,"authors":[{"name":"Yannis Kopsinis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5621929/5621929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yannis Kopsinis (M'98) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Greece, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","From January 2004 to December 2005, he has been a Research Fellow with the Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering and Electronics, the University of Edinburgh, U.K. From January 2006 to September 2009, he was a Senior Researcher in the same department.

However, these methods cannot maximize the likelihood function, and the performance is not optimal. In this paper, we propose a new method to solve the problem. With our formulation, the likelihood function can be maximized, and the optimum solution can be obtained by solving a polynomial function.

It commences with an in-depth study of the effects of increasing the size of the peaking amplifier's transistor and its conduction angle on the Doherty PA's RF performance. In particular, the impact of the extended current profile of the peaking amplifier and reduced turn-on effects on the soft-turn characteristic are thoroughly analyzed, and their impacts on the average efficiency and peak power are deduced. Furthermore, the aggravation of the memory effects that accompany the gm3-based nonlinear distortion cancellation is experimentally demonstrated. Two asymmetrical Doherty PAs prototypes are fabricated using 80 W and 150 W laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors to individually improve average efficiency and linearity. When driven with a four carrier wideband code division multiple access (4C-WCDMA) signal, the asymmetrical Doherty PA allowed for excellent drain efficiency of approximately 50%, along with high linearity of approximately -50 dBc , using a memory polynomial digital predistorter at an average output power of 50 W. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this achieved efficiency is the highest reported in the literature for a high-power Doherty PA implemented in LDMOS technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

We observed an increase in the heavy-ion upset cross section in the devices that were submitted to TID irradiations, especially at low LETs.

The unprecedented expansion of wireline and wireless networks has resulted in a tremendous increase in energy consumption and left a significant environmental footprint. Recently, it has been reported that energy costs can account for as much as half of a mobile service provider's annual operating expenses. If the aggregate energy consumption of networking devices were to follow the growth trajectories of Internet traffic (i.e., about 50 percent per year), the environmental and financial consequences would be dire. Thus, making information and communications technology (ICT) equipment and applications energy-efficient could not only have a tangible positive impact on the environment, but also help telecommunications operators attain long-term profitability. Moreover, energy-efficient communications can help the world reduce its dependence on fossil fuel, enable demand response and distributed energy resources, and ultimately achieve sustainable prosperity. Accordingly, a myriad of communications and information technologies have already been exploited by the global smart grid initiatives to empower the conventional power grid to support two-way energy and information flow.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5621952/05621966.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency in communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621966/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency in communications","volume":"48","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621966/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency in communications","sourcePdf":"014LYT-GUEST EDIT-Zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044043S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5621952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5621952","articleId":"5621966","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5621967,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Christensen","affiliation":["University of South Florida, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ken Christensen [sm] (christen@csee.usf.edu) is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida.

This effort became IEEE P802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) resulting in IEEE Std 802.3az-2010, which was approved September 30, 2010. EEE uses a Low Power Idle mode to reduce the energy consumption of a link when no packets are being sent. In this article, we describe the development of the EEE standard and how energy savings resulting from the adoption of EEE may exceed $400 million per year in the U.S. alone (and over $1 billion worldwide). We also present results from a simulation-based performance evaluation showing how packet coalescing can be used to improve the energy efficiency of EEE. Our results show that packet coalescing can significantly improve energy efficiency while keeping absolute packet delays to tolerable bounds. We are aware that coalescing may cause packet loss in downstream buffers, especially when using TCP/IP. We explore the effects of coalescing on TCP/IP flows with an ns-2 simulation, note that coalescing is already used to reduce packet processing load on the system CPU, and suggest open questions for future work. This article will help clarify what can be expected when EEE is deployed.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5621952/05621967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621952","startPage":"50","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.3az: the road to energy efficient ethernet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.3az: the road to energy efficient ethernet","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11629489","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5621967/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.3az: the road to energy efficient ethernet","sourcePdf":"015CHRISTENSEN LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052438S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5621952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5621952","articleId":"5621967","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5621968,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Young-jin Kim (young.jin_kim@alcatel-Iucent.com) holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Southern California.

The mutual supplementary saving concepts comprise component, link and network levels. At the component level the power amplifier complemented by a transceiver and a digital platform supporting advanced power management are key to efficient radio implementations. Discontinuous transmission by base stations, where hardware components are switched off, facilitate energy efficient operation at the link level. At the network level, the potential for reducing energy consumption is in the layout of networks and their management, that take into account slowly changing daily load patterns, as well as highly dynamic traffic fluctuations.

This property of the PON can be exploited for node consolidation where multiple central offices are replaced by a single one covering a larger service area. Such node consolidation is being particularly driven by the need for network operational cost saving, and is offering significant challenges to PONs. The degree of node consolidation that can be achieved is limited by the reach of conventional PON systems. In order to achieve a larger degree of node consolidation, an extension of the PON reach, beyond the conventional 20 km, is required. This article addresses the challenges of the dynamic bandwidth allocation, where increased reach results in a degradation of DBA performance and quality of service support. This degradation is a consequence of the increased propagation delay of the DBA messages exchanged between different PON elements. A potential solution to the performance degradation is the introduction of a multi-threaded DBA. In this article, we examine for both Gigabit PON and Ethernet PON, the extent to which DBA performance degradation can be reduced by exploiting multi-threading. It is found that for both standards, multi-threading, if done properly, can be used to mitigate the performance degradation due to the increased reach. To make bandwidth allocation efficient, new schemes for coordinating the multiple threads are required in long reach PON.","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5621952/05621975.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621975","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621975","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Bandwidth","EPON","Optical network units","Degradation","Delay","Propagation delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","optical fibre LAN","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic bandwidth allocation","performance degradation","quality of service","gigabit passive optical network","Ethernet passive optical network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic bandwidth allocation for long-reach PON: overcoming performance degradation","accessionNumber":"11629498","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5621975/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic bandwidth allocation for long-reach PON: overcoming performance degradation","sourcePdf":"023SKUBIC LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052159S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5621952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5621952","articleId":"5621975","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5621978,"authors":[{"name":"Sadayuki Tsugawa","affiliation":["Meijo University, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Sadayuki Tsugawa [m] (tsugawa@meijo-u.ac.jp) received his B.E., M.E., and Doctor of Engineering degrees from the University of Tokyo in 1968, 1970, and 1973, respectively.

These have significantly advanced the state of applications of intelligent transportation systems. More recently, as one leading effort toward the cyber-physical-social system, the concept of intelligent transportation spaces was proposed to further improve the vehicles, traffic, and transportation safety, efficiency and sustainability. ITSp integrate not only various ITS modules, but also pedestrians, vehicles, roadside infrastructures, traffic management centers, sensors, and satellites. With distributed and pervasive intelligence, ITSp clearly impose some stringent requirements on the information exchange among all entities within the ITSp, in terms of the information availability, reliability, fidelity, and timeliness. These requirements, together with the high mobility of vehicles and the highly variable network topology, make the communications and networking for ITSp very challenging. This article will introduce the concept of ITSp and analyze possible communication technology candidates for ITSp. Further discussions will also be provided at the end of this article.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5621952/05621980.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent transportation spaces: vehicles, traffic, communications, and beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent transportation spaces: vehicles, traffic, communications, and beyond","volume":"48","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11629503","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621980/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621980/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent transportation spaces: vehicles, traffic, communications, and beyond","sourcePdf":"028WANG LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047632S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5621952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5621952","articleId":"5621980","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5621983,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey G.

It has been applied in various areas, such as imaging, radar, speech recognition, and data acquisition. In communications, compressive sensing is largely accepted for sparse channel estimation and its variants. In this article we highlight the fundamental concepts of compressive sensing and give an overview of its application to pilot aided channel estimation. We point out that a popular assumption - that multipath channels are sparse in their equivalent baseband representation - has pitfalls. There are over-complete dictionaries that lead to much sparser channel representations and better estimation performance. As a concrete example, we detail the application of compressive sensing to multicarrier underwater acoustic communications, where the channel features sparse arrivals, each characterized by its distinct delay and Doppler scale factor. To work with practical systems, several modifications need to be made to the compressive sensing framework as the channel estimation error varies with how detailed the channel is modeled, and how data and pilot symbols are mixed in the signal design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","volume":"48","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11629493","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5621984/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of compressive sensing to sparse channel estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of compressive sensing to sparse channel estimation","sourcePdf":"032BERGER LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092231S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5621952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"375","xplore-issue":"5621952","articleId":"5621984","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5621985,"authors":[{"name":"Falko Dressler","affiliation":["University of Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Falko Dressler [S'02, M'04, SM'08] (dressler@informatik.unierlangen.de) is an assistant professor leading the Autonomic Networking Group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen.

While the individual capability of these resources to provide grid support might be very small, their presence in large numbers in many distribution networks implies that, under proper control, they can collectively become an asset for providing ancillary services. An example is the power electronics interface of a photovoltaic array mounted in a residential building roof. While its primary function is to control active power flow, when properly controlled, it can also be used to provide reactive power. This paper develops and analyzes distributed control strategies to enable the utilization of these distributed resources for provision of grid support services. We provide a careful analysis of the applicability capabilities and limitations of each of these strategies.

We assume there is a renewable energy supplier that provides energy according to a time-varying (and possibly unpredictable) supply process. The plant must serve consumers within a specified delay window, and incurs a cost of drawing energy from other (possibly non-renewable) sources if its own supply is not sufficient to meet the deadlines. We formulate two stochastic optimization problems: The first seeks to minimize the time average cost of using the other sources (and hence strives for the most efficient utilization of the renewable source). The second allows the renewable source to dynamically set a price for its service, and seeks to maximize the resulting time average profit. These problems are solved via the Lyapunov optimization technique. Our resulting algorithms do not require knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying supply and demand processes and are robust to arbitrary sample path variations.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5621993","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05621993.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5621993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for Renewable Energy Allocation to Delay Tolerant Consumers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621993/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for Renewable Energy Allocation to Delay Tolerant Consumers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630339","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621993/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Algorithms for Renewable Energy Allocation to Delay Tolerant Consumers","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072447S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5621993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5621994,"authors":[{"name":"Mardavij Roozbehani","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Mardavij","lastName":"Roozbehani","id":"37296838200"},{"name":"Munther Dahleh","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Munther","lastName":"Dahleh","id":"37301258200"},{"name":"Sanjoy Mitter","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjoy","lastName":"Mitter","id":"37266038000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5621994","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1821},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Real time systems","Electricity","Generators","Biological system modeling","ISO","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","feedback","numerical analysis","power markets","power system stability","pricing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic pricing","supply stabilization","electric power grids","real-time retail pricing mechanism","smart power grids","price stability","real-time wholesale market prices","closed loop feedback system","mathematical model","market clearing prices","locational marginal prices","wholesale balancing markets","stabilizing pricing algorithm","system efficiency","numerical simulations"]}],"abstract":"The paper proposes a mechanism for real-time pricing of electricity in smart power grids, with price stability as the primary concern. In previous publications the authors argued that relaying the real-time wholesale market prices to the end consumers creates a closed loop feedback system which could be unstable or lack robustness, leading to extreme price volatility. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed for characterization of the dynamic evolution of supply, (elastic) demand, and market clearing (locational marginal) prices under real-time pricing. It is assumed that the real-time prices for retail consumers are derived from the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) of the wholesale balancing markets. The main contribution of the paper is in presenting an effective stabilizing pricing algorithm and characterization of its effects on system efficiency. Numerical simulations conform with our analysis and show the stabilizing effect of the mechanism and its robustness to disturbances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Pricing and Stabilization of Supply and Demand in Modern Electric Power Grids","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5621994","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05621994.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5621994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5621994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5621994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Pricing and Stabilization of Supply and Demand in Modern Electric Power Grids","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5621994/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11636686","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Pricing and Stabilization of Supply and Demand in Modern Electric Power Grids","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067001S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5621994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5622015,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Bressan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Bressan","id":"37586806100"},{"name":"Leonardo Bazzaco","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Bazzaco","id":"37593235700"},{"name":"Nicola Bui","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Bui","id":"37391787600"},{"name":"Paolo Casari","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Casari","id":"37296365200"},{"name":"Lorenzo Vangelista","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Vangelista","id":"37347555300"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622015","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2011},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622015","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Protocols","Smart grids","Sensors","Peer to peer computing","Web services","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","middleware","power engineering computing","power system measurement","routing protocols","smart power grids","Web services","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart monitoring system","wireless sensor network","actuator networks","solid routing infrastructure","routing protocol","low-power and lossy networks","IETF ROLL working group","representational state transfer paradigm","REST paradigm","binary Web service","publish-subscribe mechanism","RPL performance evaluation","smart grid"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622015","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622015.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Deployment of a Smart Monitoring System Using Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we explore the implementation of a smart monitoring system over a wireless sensor network, with particular emphasis on the creation of a solid routing infrastructure through the Routing Protocol for Low- power and lossy networks (RPL), whose definition is currently being discussed within the IETF ROLL working group.

The requirements of scalability, realtimeness and security make the wireless meter reading highly challenging. On assuming that the number of smart meters is large and the data burst is sparse, i.e., only a small fraction of the smart meters are reporting their power loads at the same time, the technique of compressed sensing is applied for the wireless meter reading. The distinguishing feature of the compressed meter reading is that the active smart meters are allowed to transmit simultaneously and the AP is able to distinguish the reports from different smart meters. The simultaneous access results in uniform delays, in contrast to the possible large delay in carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) technique. The random sequence used in the compressed sensing enhances the privacy and integrity of the meter reading. The validity of the proposed scheme is then demonstrated by numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622027.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Meter Reading for Delay-Sensitive and Secure Load Report in Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Multiaccess communication","Meter reading","Noise","Compressed sensing","Smart grids","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","delays","metering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed meter reading","access point","smart grid","wireless meter reading","active smart meter","carrier sensing multiple access technique","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Meter Reading for Delay-Sensitive and Secure Load Report in Smart Grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630353","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Meter Reading for Delay-Sensitive and Secure Load Report in Smart Grid","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045895S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5622029,"authors":[{"name":"Aitor Aruzuaga","affiliation":["ZIV Group, Zamudio, Spain"],"firstName":"Aitor","lastName":"Aruzuaga"},{"name":"Inigo Berganza","affiliation":["Iberdrola, Bilbao, Spaine"],"firstName":"Inigo","lastName":"Berganza","id":"37593401400"},{"name":"Alberto Sendin","affiliation":["Iberdrola, Bilbao, Spaine"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Sendin","id":"37593400000"},{"name":"Manu Sharma","affiliation":["Current Technologies International, M\u00e4genwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37598607200"},{"name":"Badri Varadarajan","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Badri","lastName":"Varadarajan","id":"37331884100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622029","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Peer to peer computing","Certification","Microprogramming","Throughput","Modulation","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","IP networks","OFDM modulation","open systems","power meters","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PRIME interoperability tests","powerline intelligent metering evolution","powerline communication","smart metering","PRIME PHY/MAC specifications","PRIME Alliance","industry consortium","meter vendors","semiconductor suppliers","OFDM modulation","CENELEC A band","tree-topology networks","IPv4","IEC 61334-4-32","IPv6","frequency 9 kHz to 95 kHz"]}],"abstract":"PRIME (PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution) is one of the prominent upcoming powerline communication technologies, targeted for use in smart metering applications.

The legacy power generation and transmission concept is converting to a massively distributed energy generation landscape integrating an extensive number of variable and small renewable energy resources such as biomass or PV installations with all their challenging effects on the energy grid. New stakeholders (e.g. energy resource aggregators), more flexibility for the consumers (energy market place), and totally new concepts (loading of e-Cars, usage of e-Cars as flexible power storage) have to be respected. Innovative monitoring and control concepts are required to operate these distributed energy resources in a reliable and safe way. This paper describes the principles for an efficient management of a massively distributed energy system based on small and variable energy resources. For evaluation purposes of this approach a newly developed coupled energy grid communication network simulator is introduced with which large scale aspects of the new ICT management frame\u00acworks can be studied in a smart grid environment.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622032","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622032.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622032","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability of Smart Grid Protocols: Protocols and Their Simulative Evaluation for Massively Distributed DERs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scalability of Smart Grid Protocols: Protocols and Their Simulative Evaluation for Massively Distributed DERs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622032/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630389","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability of Smart Grid Protocols: Protocols and Their Simulative Evaluation for Massively Distributed DERs","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100268S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5622033,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Jansen","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Jansen","id":"37586067100"},{"name":"Carl Binding","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Binding","id":"37593221900"},{"name":"Olle Sundstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olle","lastName":"Sundstr\u00f6m","id":"37593222500"},{"name":"Dieter Gantenbein","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Gantenbein","id":"37389232100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622033","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2019},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Optimization","Batteries","Forecasting","Schedules","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","optimisation","power plants","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle virtual power plant","vehicle-to-grid technology","trip prediction algorithm","optimization problem","communication protocols","trip information"]}],"abstract":"This paper outlines an architecture of an electric vehicle (EV) based vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integrating virtual power plant (VPP).

One of the critical challenges with respect to the infrastructure is the setup and deployment of a future-proof common standard for smart grids. The charging process requires a smooth communication between electrical vehicles, the power supply equipment and the smart grid. In this regard, different kind of charging locations, the charging characteristic as well as several vehicle to grid stakeholders have to be considered. This paper discusses the vehicle to grid integration and gives an overview of the current ongoing working assumption in the international joint ISO/IEC standardization of the vehicle to grid communication interface (V2G CI). Furthermore, the paper shows an approach how this communication interface can be integrated into the smart grid communication. First project results are presented demonstrating the successful implementation of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622035","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622035.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnections and Communications of Electric Vehicles and Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622035/","displayDocTitle":"Interconnections and Communications of Electric Vehicles and Smart Grids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630384","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622035/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnections and Communications of Electric Vehicles and Smart Grids","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092687S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5622037,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Pan","affiliation":["Decision Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Pan","id":"37595327500"},{"name":"Russell Bent","affiliation":["Decision Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Bent","id":"38504345700"},{"name":"Alan Berscheid","affiliation":["Decision Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Berscheid","id":"37593242900"},{"name":"David Izraelevitz","affiliation":["Decision Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Izraelevitz","id":"37604164400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622037","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":979},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Power grids","Load modeling","Transportation","Generators","Stochastic processes","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","power grids","renewable energy sources","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","transportation","renewable energy sources","PHEV exchange station","vehicle-to-grid","V2G a system","power grid"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating PHEV Exchange Stations in V2G","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622037.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622037","startPage":"173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622037","abstract":"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are an environmentally friendly technology that is expected to rapidly penetrate the transportation system. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received considerable attention as clean power options for future generation expansion. However, these sources are intermittent and increase the uncertainty in the ability to generate power. The deployment of PHEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system provide a potential mechanism for reducing the variability of renewable energy sources. For example, PHEV supporting infrastructures like battery exchange stations that provide battery service to PHEV customers could be used as storage devices to stabilize the grid when renewable energy production is fluctuating. In this paper, we study how to best site these stations in terms of how they can support both the transportation system and the power grid. To model this problem we develop a two-stage stochastic program to optimally locate the stations prior to the realization of battery demands, loads, and generation capacity of renewable power sources. We develop two test cases to study the benefits and the performance of these systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11630362","htmlLink":"/document/5622037/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Locating PHEV Exchange Stations in V2G","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating PHEV Exchange Stations in V2G","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080805S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5622045,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Kosut","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Kosut","id":"37395775800"},{"name":"Liyan Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Liyan","lastName":"Jia","id":"37398743700"},{"name":"Robert J.

It is believed that state estimators will also play an increasingly important role in future smart power grids, as a tool to optimally and more dynamically route power flows. Therefore security of the estimator becomes an important issue. The estimators are currently located in control centers, and large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted communication channels to the centers. We here study stealthy false-data attacks against these estimators. We define a security measure tailored to quantify how hard attacks are to perform, and describe an efficient algorithm to compute it. Since there are so many measurement devices in these systems, it is not reasonable to assume that all devices can be made encrypted overnight in the future. Therefore we propose two algorithms to place encrypted devices in the system such as to maximize their utility in terms of increased system security. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on two IEEE benchmark power networks under two attack and protection cost models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622046.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stealth Attacks and Protection Schemes for State Estimators in Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Power measurement","Upper bound","Power systems","Cryptography","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system protection","power system security","power system state estimation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system state estimator","protection schemes","power flows","smart power grids","control centers","communication channels","stealth false-data attacks","measurement devices","system security","IEEE benchmark power networks","protection cost models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stealth Attacks and Protection Schemes for State Estimators in Power Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630327","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stealth Attacks and Protection Schemes for State Estimators in Power Systems","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046439S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5622047,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Kalogridis","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Kalogridis","id":"37593494900"},{"name":"Costas Efthymiou","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Costas","lastName":"Efthymiou","id":"37428869500"},{"name":"Stojan Z.

In particular, (1) we introduce a power management model using a rechargeable battery, (2) we propose a power mixing algorithm, and (3) we evaluate its protection level by proposing three different privacy metrics: an information theoretic (relative entropy), a clustering classification, and a correlation/regression one; these are tested on different metering datasets. This paper sets the ground for further research on the subject of optimising home energy management with regards to hiding load signatures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11630395","htmlLink":"/document/5622047/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Privacy for Smart Meters: Towards Undetectable Appliance Load Signatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy for Smart Meters: Towards Undetectable Appliance Load Signatures","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083066S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5622048,"authors":[{"name":"Le Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Xie","id":"37690909500"},{"name":"Yilin Mo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yilin","lastName":"Mo","id":"37605284400"},{"name":"Bruno Sinopoli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Sinopoli","id":"37265687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622048","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":222,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Electricity supply industry","Electric potential","State estimation","Generators","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","power markets","SCADA systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["false data injection","electricity market","SCADA","locational marginal price","IEEE 14 bus system","data measurement detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622048","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622048.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622048","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"False Data Injection Attacks in Electricity Markets","abstract":"We present a potential class of cyber attack, named false data injection attack, against the state estimation in deregulated electricity markets.

This paper describes a method for securely anonymizing frequent (for example, every few minutes) electrical metering data sent by a smart meter. Although such frequent metering data may be required by a utility or electrical energy distribution network for operational reasons, this data may not necessarily need to be attributable to a specific smart meter or consumer. It does, however, need to be securely attributable to a specific location (e.g. a group of houses or apartments) within the electricity distribution network. The method described in this paper provides a 3rd party escrow mechanism for authenticated anonymous meter readings which are difficult to associate with a particular smart meter or customer. This method does not preclude the provision of attributable metering data that is required for other purposes such as billing, account management or marketing research purposes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","startPage":"238","endPage":"243","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Grid Privacy via Anonymization of Smart Metering Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5622050/","displayDocTitle":"Smart Grid Privacy via Anonymization of Smart Metering Data","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630372","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Grid Privacy via Anonymization of Smart Metering Data","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052644S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5622056,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Biagi","affiliation":["Information, Electrical and Communication Engineering Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Biagi","id":"37275283000"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622056","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Delay","Switches","Smart grids","Repeaters","Energy consumption","Power line communications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","distribution networks","power transmission","routing protocols","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location assisted routing techniques","power line communication","smart grids","energy generation","energy distribution","energy consumption","electricity grids","electricity dependent society","communications infrastructure","PLC technology","medium-voltage distribution grids","network nodes","multihop transmission","unicast messages","geographic routing protocols","transmission delay"]}],"abstract":"Smart Grid collectively refers to various visions of how energy generation, distribution, and consumption should be managed to overcome many of the shortcomings of today's electricity grids and to sustain our ever more electricity dependent societies. One important enabling component of Smart Grid will be a fine-grained and reliable communications infrastructure that links together the many elements of the grid. Since by definition all these elements are connected to power lines, power line communications (PLC) technology is a natural candidate to build parts of such an infrastructure. In this paper, we consider the use of PLC in low- and medium-voltage distribution grids to connect network nodes (e.g., meters, actuators, sensors) through multihop transmission. In particular, we address the problem of routing of unicast messages making use of the stationarity of nodes. To this end, we motivate and investigate the application of geographic routing protocols and gauge their performance with respect to energy consumption and transmission delay.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622056","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622056.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622056","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Assisted Routing Techniques for Power Line Communication in Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Location Assisted Routing Techniques for Power Line Communication in Smart Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622056/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630332","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Assisted Routing Techniques for Power Line Communication in Smart Grids","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056016S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5622057,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Godfrey","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Godfrey","id":"37541527700"},{"name":"Sara Mullen","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Mullen","id":"37593586300"},{"name":"David W.

The prime contribution of this paper is to propose a secure aggregation protocol that meets the requirements of Smart Grids, and to analyze its efficiency considering various system configurations as well as the impact of the wireless channel through packet error rates. Relying on analysis and corroborative simulations, unprecedented design guidelines are derived which determine the operational point beyond which aggregation is useful as well quantifying the superiority of our protocol w.r.t. non-aggregated solutions.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622063","startPage":"333","endPage":"338","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622063.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Lossless Aggregation for Smart Grid M2M Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Secure Lossless Aggregation for Smart Grid M2M Networks","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622063/","accessionNumber":"11630370","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622063/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Lossless Aggregation for Smart Grid M2M Networks","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056155S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5622064,"authors":[{"name":"Fengjun Li","affiliation":["College of IST, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Fengjun","lastName":"Li","id":"37400965600"},{"name":"Bo Luo","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404439100"},{"name":"Peng Liu","affiliation":["College of IST, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37276301800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622064","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":317,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3996},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a distributed incremental data aggregation approach, in which data aggregation is performed at all smart meters involved in routing the data from the source meter to the collector unit. With a carefully constructed aggregation tree, the aggregation route covers the entire local neighborhood or any arbitrary set of designated nodes with minimum overhead. To protect user privacy, homomorphic encryption is used to secure the data en route. Therefore, all the meters participate in the aggregation, without seeing any intermediate or final result. In this way, our approach supports efficient data aggregation in smart grids, while fully protecting user privacy. This approach is especially suitable for smart grids with repetitive routine data aggregation tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622064.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Information Aggregation for Smart Grids Using Homomorphic Encryption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Encryption","Privacy","Public key","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","power meters","power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure information aggregation","smart grids","homomorphic encryption","distributed incremental data aggregation approach","smart meters","source meter","user privacy protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Secure Information Aggregation for Smart Grids Using Homomorphic Encryption","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630367","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Information Aggregation for Smart Grids Using Homomorphic Encryption","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068511S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"317","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5622068,"authors":[{"name":"Robin Berthier","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, Information Trust Institute,  and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Berthier","id":"37588792800"},{"name":"William H.

We base the study on narrowband (<; 500 kHz) PLC based on OFDM in general, with specific focus on two prominent PLC industrial specifications for e-metering applications: PRIME and G3. From the simulation results, for white noise and for higher coding rates we find that the Reed Solomon (RS) outer code used in G3 yields significant gains, but can be improved by adapting the RS code rate to the packet size. For lower coding rates, we do not find significant advantage of adding RS coding. For time-domain impulsive noise, we find that the best performance-complexity tradeoff is obtained by choosing the interleaver size to be somewhere between one symbol (PRIME) and the entire packet (G3). Specifically, it is beneficial to choose an interleaver whose size is comparable to the AC lines period, which is the typically inter-burst duration of impulsive noise. For narrowband interference, both PRIME and G3 offer good performance, but PRIME is preferable because it achieves higher data rates by employing higher order modulation. The immunity to narrowband interference makes PRIME/G3 an attractive candidate for automotive charging applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Enhancements of Narrowband OFDM Powerline Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622070","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622070.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Enhancements of Narrowband OFDM Powerline Communication Systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622070/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Enhancements of Narrowband OFDM Powerline Communication Systems","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058679S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5622073,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Caron","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Informatique, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9erieure, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Caron","id":"37587869700"},{"name":"George Kesidis","affiliation":["CS&E and EE Departments, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Kesidis","id":"37265674100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622073","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":189,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3009},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Schedules","Energy consumption","Load modeling","Optimal scheduling","Smart grids","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","power consumption","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive-based energy consumption scheduling algorithms","smart grid","demand response","information sharing","dynamic pricing scheme","load profiles","distributed algorithm","cooperative game","distributed stochastic strategies"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study Demand Response (DR) problematics for different levels of information sharing in a smart grid. We propose a dynamic pricing scheme incentivizing consumers to achieve an aggregate load profile suitable for utilities, and study how close they can get to an ideal flat profile depending on how much information they share. When customers can share all their load profiles, we provide a distributed algorithm, set up as a cooperative game between consumers, which significantly reduces the total cost and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the system. In the absence of full information sharing (for reasons of privacy), when users have only access to the instantaneous total load on the grid, we provide distributed stochastic strategies that successfully exploit this information to improve the overall load profile. Simulation results confirm that these solutions efficiently benefit from information sharing within the grid and reduce both the total cost and PAR.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622073","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622073.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive-Based Energy Consumption Scheduling Algorithms for the Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incentive-Based Energy Consumption Scheduling Algorithms for the Smart Grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622073/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630386","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5622073/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive-Based Energy Consumption Scheduling Algorithms for the Smart Grid","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05882S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5622076,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Chen","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science Division, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292789300"},{"name":"Na Li","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science Division, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Li","id":"37405750500"},{"name":"Steven H.

Each subscriber is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) unit as part of its smart meter. Each smart meter is connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure such as a local area network. This allows two-way communication among smart meters. Considering the importance of energy pricing as an essential tool to develop efficient demand side management strategies, we propose a novel real-time pricing algorithm for the future smart grid. We focus on the interactions between the smart meters and the energy provider through the exchange of control messages which contain subscribers' energy consumption and the real-time price information. First, we analytically model the subscribers' preferences and their energy consumption patterns in form of carefully selected utility functions based on concepts from microeconomics. Second, we propose a distributed algorithm which automatically manages the interactions among the ECC units at the smart meters and the energy provider. The algorithm finds the optimal energy consumption levels for each subscriber to maximize the aggregate utility of all subscribers in the system in a fair and efficient fashion. Finally, we show that the energy provider can encourage some desirable consumption patterns among the subscribers by means of the proposed real-time pricing interactions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed distributed algorithm can potentially benefit both subscribers and the energy provider.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622077.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Real-Time Pricing Algorithm Based on Utility Maximization for Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Power demand","Real time systems","Energy consumption","Electricity","Simulation","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","distributed algorithms","energy consumption","meters","microeconomics","pricing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal real-time pricing algorithm","utility maximization","smart grid","smart power infrastructure","energy source","energy consumption controller unit","ECC unit","smart meter","power grid","local area network","two-way communication","energy pricing","efficient demand side management strategy","subscriber optimal energy consumption level","microeconomics","distributed algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Real-Time Pricing Algorithm Based on Utility Maximization for Smart Grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630377","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Real-Time Pricing Algorithm Based on Utility Maximization for Smart Grid","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052438S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"589","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5622078,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel O'Neill","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"O'Neill","id":"37269517600"},{"name":"Marco Levorato","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Levorato","id":"37296462200"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6512-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6511-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5622078","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Pricing","Mathematical model","Delay","Equations","Energy management","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy management systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residential demand response","reinforcement learning","energy management system","residential energy costs","energy usage","online learning application","energy prices","residential device usage","CAES models","transition probabilities","Markov chains","consumer preferences","pricing modifications","price-unaware energy allocation"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel energy management system for residential demand response.

The homes are assumed to use energy management controllers (EMCs) to control the operation of some of their appliances. EMCs, which are a feature of the emerging SmartGrid, use both prices and user preferences to control power usage across the home. We first present a simple optimization model for determining the timing of appliance operation to take advantage of lower electricity rates during off-peak periods. We then demonstrate, using simulation, that the resulting solution may in fact be more peaky than the ``non-scheduled'' solution, thereby negating some of the benefits (for the utility) of off-peak pricing models. We then propose a distributed scheduling mechanism to reduce peak demand within a neighborhood of homes. The mechanism provides homes a guaranteed base level of power and allows them to compete for additional power to meet their needs. Finally, we introduce a more powerful EMC optimization model, based on dynamic programming, which, unlike our first optimization model, accounts for the potential for electricity capacity constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622084/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11630387","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622084/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control Mechanisms for Residential Electricity Demand in SmartGrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Mechanisms for Residential Electricity Demand in SmartGrids","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058484S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5622088,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We take advantage of the remarkable property of congestion games, according to which they are equivalent to potential games. We define a potential function characterized by a meaningful physical interpretation, so that we obtain the favorable result that the optimal local solution of each selfish consumer is also the solution of a global objective.

SG communications needs to be designed to accommodate the current energy management requirements as well as the potential demand of future applications. In this paper, we propose the application of cognitive radio (CR) based on the IEEE 802.22 standard in the SG wide area networks (WANs). We discuss the benefits of the proposed scheme including opportunistic access of TV bands, extended coverage, ease of upgradability, self-healing and fault-tolerant design. The proposed scheme can work as a secondary radio particularly in urban areas and as a backup in disaster management. In rural areas, however, a stand-alone radio based on IEEE 802.22 can effectively provide broadband access because of the wide area coverage due to the good propagation characteristics of TV bands.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622097","publicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5619950/5621989/05622097.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio for Smart Grid Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622097/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio for Smart Grid Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630368","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5622097/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio for Smart Grid Communications","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047643S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5619950","isNumber":"5621989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5619950","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5621989","articleId":"5622097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5622211,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jing Liu","id":"37087167453"},{"name":"Qing Song","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qing Song","id":"37087569522"},{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Di Wu","id":"37087590838"},{"name":"Jia-yong Huang","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jia-yong Huang","id":"37087591297"},{"name":"Chun-song Zhang","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chun-song Zhang","id":"37087591161"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622211","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","chemistry computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network","liquid identification","BP artificial neural network","computational intelligence","machine learning","pattern recognition","liquid recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","Liquid drop fingerprint","Liquid identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622211","abstract":"BP artificial neural network (BP ANN) is one of the most active branch of computational intelligence and machine learning area recently.

Computer simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than the existing ones in terms of timing and frequency accuracy, and that the frequency offset estimation range is up to the whole channel band.

OFDM is a promising technology for optical communications. An efficient timing synchronization scheme for asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM)-based optical wireless communications systems with implicit training is proposed. The pseudo-noise (PN) sequence modulated by ACO-OFDM as training sequence is sent synchronously with a data symbol in the same symbol cycle. By using local sequence and the received signal correlation operation, receiver accumulates the energy of the implicit training to achieve timing synchronization.

The method has a better performance and converges quickly.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622355","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","startPage":"V14-175","endPage":"V14-178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622109","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622109/05622355.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Pixel","IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","Immune system","Computational modeling","Gray-scale","Veins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","biometrics (access control)","blood vessels","cellular neural nets","feature extraction","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand veins feature extraction","vein pattern recognition","contactless near infrared biometric technology","fingerprint based identification system","binary morphology","multilayer discrete time cellular neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hand vein recognition","Cellular Neural Network","image processingformatting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hand veins feature extraction based on morphology and Cellular Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622355/","isConference":true,"volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/5622355/","accessionNumber":"11652748","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hand veins feature extraction based on morphology and Cellular Neural Network","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp048vol146062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057159S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","xplore-issue":"5622109","articleId":"5622355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5622356,"authors":[{"name":"Liping Su","affiliation":["Guangxi Technological College of Machinery and Electricity, Nanning, China"],"lastName":"Liping Su","id":"37587722500"},{"name":"Dong Chen","affiliation":["Guangxi Teachers Education University, Nanning, China"],"lastName":"Dong Chen","id":"37592677800"},{"name":"Tong Wu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37534602900"},{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37600874300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622356","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"abstract":"Cooperative relaying technology is proved to be an efficient method to exploit the capacity of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. In this paper, the transmit power allocation (TPA) strategies for various relaying protocols are investigated for MIMO cooperative relaying systems. First, the TPA scheme for compress-and-forward (CF) protocol is proposed with closed-form by utilizing the Lagrange function. Second, a novel best node and antenna selection strategy is exploited for decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, which can improve the efficiency for the transmit power. Besides, the TPA scheme for amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol is analyzed. Simulation results show that the efficient TPA schemes can achieve significant gain by exploit the features of multihop transmission. Furthermore, compared with AF, DF, and hybrid decode-and-forward (HDF) protocols, the CF relaying can be used for coverage extension, which is a candidate technology for future LTE-A networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622109/05622356.pdf","startPage":"V14-179","endPage":"V14-183","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient power allocation schemes for MIMO cooperative relaying systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","frequency hop communication","MIMO communication","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit power allocation strategies","MIMO cooperative relaying systems","multiple-input multiple-output wireless system","compress-and-forward protocol","Lagrange function","antenna selection strategy","decode-and-forward relaying","amplify-and-forward protocol","multihop transmission","hybrid decode-and-forward protocols","3G wireless communication systems","4G wireless communications systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative relay","MIMO relaying","compress-and-forward","decode-and-forward","coverage extension"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient power allocation schemes for MIMO cooperative relaying systems","isConference":true,"volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/5622356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660820","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient power allocation schemes for MIMO cooperative relaying systems","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp049vol146064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050034S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5622109","articleId":"5622356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5622366,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-jun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation and Electronic Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Yan-jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088156081"},{"name":"Yao-da Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation and Electronic Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yao-da","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085939571"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622366","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Sliding mode control","Artificial neural networks","Switches","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","gradient methods","radial basis function networks","reliability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved RBF neural network","equivalent sliding mode control","gradient descent algorithm","local minima","variable learning rate","tracking precision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gradient descent algorithm","RBF network","variable learning rate","equivalent sliding mode control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622366","abstract":"Equivalent sliding mode control based on RBF neural network uses the traditional gradient descent algorithm to achieve the control function.

The stator voltage vector could either be sensed from the machine terminals or reconstructed using inverter switching status and the DC bus voltage. A novel method of parameter identification using wavelet neural network is presented for performance improvement in low speed status of induction motor system. The advantage of the wavelet logarithmic time frequency bands is in achieving flexible frequency resolution, thus making it able to extract both high-frequency and low-frequency components from the original signal. In training process, the wavelet network learns adequate decision functions and arbitrarily complex decision regions defined by the weight coefficients. The accurate stator flux vector and electromagnetic torque are acquired by the network output once the instants are detected, where the direct torque control can be applicable in the low region and the inverter control strategy can be optimized. The simulation results show that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the torque ripple and current ripple, acquiring good performance in low speed state.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622557","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622100/05622557.pdf","startPage":"V15-151","endPage":"V15-153","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and analysis of neural network-based induction motor control system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and analysis of neural network-based induction motor control system","isConference":true,"volume":"15","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11640668","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5622557/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and analysis of neural network-based induction motor control system","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp043vol156378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049373S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","xplore-issue":"5622100","articleId":"5622557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5622616,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xun","affiliation":["Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xun","id":"37661565800"},{"name":"Wu Xiaoming","affiliation":["College of Biology Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wu Xiaoming","id":"37087452501"},{"name":"Li Ningshan","affiliation":["College of Biology Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Li Ningshan","id":"37087904206"},{"name":"Lou Tanqi","affiliation":["Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lou Tanqi","id":"37087902753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622616","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Radial basis function networks","Logic gates","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","kidney","medical computing","patient treatment","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network","glomerular filtration rate","Chinese patient","chronic kidney disease","artificial neural network","engineering forecasting","serum creatinine","enzymatic method","RBF network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radial basis function","chronic kidney disease","glomerular filtration rate","serum creatinine","artificial neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622616","abstract":"Artificial neural networks have been widely used in the field of engineering forecasting.

Firstly, each input-output characteristic is approximated with different Neural Network, after which the structures, weights and biases of the Neural Network depicting different characteristic of the ECM are acquired. Secondly, the structures are described in PSpice language to form sub-circuits respectively.

Traditional statistical classifiers such as minimum distance (MD) have been used to extract LUC classifications in urban areas, but these classifiers rely on assumptions that may limit their utilities for many datasets. On the contrary, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) provide nonlinear and accurate ways to classify LUC from remote sensing images without having to rely on statistical assumptions. This article compared the results and accuracies of the ANN and SMV classifiers with the statistical MD classifier as a reference in extracting urban LUC from ETM+ images in Guangzhou, China. Results show that the overall accuracies of urban LUC classifications are approximately 96.03%, 94.71% and 77.79%, and the kappa coefficients reach 0.94, 0.92 and 0.67 for the ANN, SVM and MD classifiers, respectively, indicating that the ANN and SVM classifiers have greatly better accuracies than the traditional MD algorithm. It is concluded that while the ANN performs slightly better than the SVM, both ANN and SVM are effective algorithms in urban LUC extraction from ETM+ images because of their high accuracy and good performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622651","startPage":"V13-52","endPage":"V13-56","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622196","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622196/05622651.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of artificial neural network and support vector machine methods for urban land use/cover classifications from remote sensing images A Case Study of Guangzhou, South China","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622651/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of artificial neural network and support vector machine methods for urban land use/cover classifications from remote sensing images A Case Study of Guangzhou, South China","isConference":true,"volume":"13","htmlLink":"/document/5622651/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11641047","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of artificial neural network and support vector machine methods for urban land use/cover classifications from remote sensing images A Case Study of Guangzhou, South China","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp017vol132615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053658S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5622196","articleId":"5622651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5622657,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Dong Li","affiliation":["School of Vocational and Continuing Education, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"lastName":"Ji-Dong Li","id":"37598868900"},{"name":"Xue-Jie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"lastName":"Xue-Jie Zhang","id":"37405048500"},{"name":"Yun Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"lastName":"Yun Gao","id":"37404898400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622657","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex classification system","genetic algorithm","general purpose learning technique","fuzzy rules-based classification system","local convergence","classification problem","learning rule","search space","fitness sharing","similarity value","antecedent fuzzy set","sonar signal classification","hand movement recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["complex classification problems","genetic fuzzy rule-based systems","fitness-sharing-based learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622657","abstract":"Genetic algorithms, as general purpose learning techniques, have been widely applied in the modeling of fuzzy rules-based classification system. However, the algorithms are more vulnerable to local convergence as a result of the increasing complexity and dimensionality of classification problems, which reduces the performance of the algorithms. To prevent the algorithms only learning rules from small subset of the search space, a fitness sharing method based on the similarity level of one rule from its neighbours rules is proposed. The similarity level is calculated by the similarity values of different antecedent fuzzy sets, which are cached for reducing the additional computing load. The proposed method is studied for two complex data, the sonar signals classification and the hand movement recognition problems. And the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to efficiently achieve accurate performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622657","startPage":"V10-576","endPage":"V10-580","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622205","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622205/05622657.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning fuzzy rules for modeling complex classification systems using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622657/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning fuzzy rules for modeling complex classification systems using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5622657/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11641164","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning fuzzy rules for modeling complex classification systems using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp138vol101789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081868S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5622205","articleId":"5622657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5622661,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Yan","affiliation":["School of Computer & Information Engineering Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shi Yan","id":"37087336534"},{"name":"Wang Qin","affiliation":["Information & Technology Department, Beijing, China","Information & Technology Department, Bank of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Qin","id":"37087145142"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622661","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social learning","particle swarm optimization","ensemble learning technique","PSO algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization (PSO)","ensemble learning","sub swarms","social learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622661","abstract":"In this paper social learning in particle swarm optimization is extended.

In addition, a whole swarm is divided into several parts and in each sub swarm, a particle also learns from another sub swarm's best particle. Based on these, an improved algorithm, named extended social learning guided particle swarm optimization (EGPSO), is proposed. Ensemble learning can help providing a more accurate global guide and learning from other groups can help increasing diversity.

This paper addresses the topology management problem in cognitive radio Ad Hoc networks (CRAHNs). Distributed multihop architecture, mobility of CR users, spectrum availability variance in different time and location are some of the key distinguish challenges for spectrum access in CRAHNs. Cluster structure is an efficient way to organize CRs and coordinate their spectrum sharing. Based on the analysis of CRAHNs environment, we propose a local control channel topology management scheme (LCCTM) in this paper. The scheme considers both the cluster size and stability of the structure and provides a desirable balance between them by the assignment of backup heads and control channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficient and reliability of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622668","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622205/05622668.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622668","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","startPage":"V10-544","endPage":"V10-548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-based distributed topology management in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-based distributed topology management in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622668/","isConference":true,"volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5622668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641176","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-based distributed topology management in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp131vol101769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068109S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5622205","articleId":"5622668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5622672,"authors":[{"name":"Hailiang Shi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics & Information Science of Light Industry, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hailiang Shi","id":"37087610932"},{"name":"Peixu Xing","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics & Information Science of Light Industry, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Peixu Xing","id":"37087609374"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622672","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Gallium","Image resolution","Erbium","PSNR","Computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","geophysical image processing","image fusion","principal component analysis","remote sensing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing image","principal component analysis","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","fusion method","multispectral satellite image","panchromatic satellite image","approximation coefficients","spatial information","universal image qualigy index","local sobel gradient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image fusion","pca","nsct","UIQI","local Sobel gradient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622672","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622205","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622205/05622672.pdf","startPage":"V10-534","endPage":"V10-538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of remote sensing images based on Principal Component Analysis and Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform","abstract":"A novel fusion method is proposed for multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) satellite images using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT).

However, the kernel matrix of the background is generated by all image pixels without considering the interference of anomaly target pixels which will make the miss rate increase and consume large memory. To resolve the problem, an anomaly detection algorithm based on background endmember extraction and kernel RX algorithm is introduced.

The main factor is the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by aberration of transmission channel. The equalization technique is an efficient method to overcome ISI and improve the characteristics of the system. And the blind equalization technique is the method that just relies on the prior-information of received channel output sequence to adjust the equalizer weights for rebuilding the sending sequence without a known training sequence available. Genetic algorithm optimizing neural network (GA-BP) is one of the blind equalization methods. A preferable local solution space is offered to the neural network by using GA to optimize weights of the neural network for the fitness function of GA includes the information of the cost function of blind equalization. Then, a precise searching is finished in this space with BP neural network algorithm. But simple genetic algorithm (SGA) produces a new value only based on the mutation operator. It often obtains a solution without high precision. Moreover, deficiencies of SGA such as the unusual slow convergence, bad stability and easily oriented prematurity have become the biggest obstacle for its further application. To solve these problems, a clonal genetic algorithm (CGA) is proposed, to increase the precision of the solution. In this paper the new CGA-BP algorithm is used to realize blind equalization. The computer simulations show that the CGA-BP algorithm obtains good convergence characteristics and satisfied equalization results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622830/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11640976","isConference":true,"volume":"13","htmlLink":"/document/5622830/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The research of blind equalization algorithm based on clonal genetic algorithm and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The research of blind equalization algorithm based on clonal genetic algorithm and neural network","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp106vol132736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128037S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5622196","articleId":"5622830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5622865,"authors":[{"name":"Song Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Song Yang","id":"37405311200"},{"name":"Li Jianping","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Jianping","id":"37411241000"},{"name":"Cai Chaoshi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cai Chaoshi","id":"37541945000"},{"name":"Yang wei","affiliation":["Sino-German Vocational and Technical, Tianjin College, China"],"lastName":"Yang wei","id":"37600538600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5622865","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"Hybrid Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) can provide two types of coding gains: temporal diversity and spatial multiple gains due to Alamouti space time block code (STBC) and mulantenna.

It is demonstrated in numerical results that the proposed algorithm can obtain a majority of the efficient system throughput of the optimal scheme with acceptable implementation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622913","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5602791/5622205/05622913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5622205","startPage":"V10-17","endPage":"V10-21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic adaptive modulation scheme for MU-MIMO downlink zero-forcing transmissions in presence of imperfect channel information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic adaptive modulation scheme for MU-MIMO downlink zero-forcing transmissions in presence of imperfect channel information","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5622913/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641169","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5622913/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic adaptive modulation scheme for MU-MIMO downlink zero-forcing transmissions in presence of imperfect channel information","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"rp010vol101456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051396S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","xplore-issue":"5622205","articleId":"5622913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5623052,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Junwen","affiliation":["Electronic Department of Guangdong Agriculture-Industry, Business Polytechnic College, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Gao Junwen","id":"37087897503"},{"name":"Liu Jiancheng","affiliation":["Electronic Department of Guangdong Agriculture-Industry, Business Polytechnic College, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Liu Jiancheng","id":"37087361236"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5623052","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Equalizers","Delay","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Feedforward neural networks","Neurons","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective algorithm recognition","higher order multilayer neural networks","HOMLNN","evolved functional neural network","EFNN","self evolve neurons","dynamic backpropagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","Algorithm","dynamical systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623052","abstract":"A new neural network architecture, call a higher order multi-layer neural networks(HOMLNN) is presented.

The response signal is produced only in the case that the interrogation covers the operational frequency band of the SAW resonator. Burst of sinusoidal is used in the experiment to excite the resonator, and analysis of the sensing signal reveals that the response signal is an exponential decay signal of single frequency, and changes of strain lead to a shift of the resonance frequency. Torque applied to the shaft can be acquired from changes of the center frequency of the resonator. The frequency resolution of traditional FFT spectrum analysis method is limited by sampling length, which can't meet the accuracy requirement of SAW torque measurement. Parameter estimation method, such as MLE (Maximum likelihood estimate) or LSE (Least Square estimate) can be used, but it is time-consuming. In this paper, GA (Genetic algorithm) is employed to estimate parameters of the sensing signal, in particular, the center frequency. Before the introduction of genetic algorithms, response signal should be converted to sinusoid with Hilbert envelope-demodulation. This can simplify the waveform greatly. Hence, the work is turned into extracting sinusoidal signal parameters from the limited sampling, including frequency, amplitude, phase and DC offset. For the demodulated single frequency signal, the resonance frequency can be got directly in time domain by genetic algorithm. The results show that this method can estimate the frequency more accurately and faster.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623060/","isConference":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5623060/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637251","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating parameters of passive SAW torque sensing signal using Genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating parameters of passive SAW torque sensing signal using Genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taiyuan","sourcePdf":"rp046Vol91092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045343S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5602791","isNumber":"5622941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5602791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5622941","articleId":"5623060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5623061,"authors":[{"name":"Yuming Mao","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Shandong Jiaotong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Mao","id":"37592613600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5623061","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Hospitals","Training","Heuristic algorithms","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","medical computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","fever patient number forecast","BP neural network","Shandong chest hospital"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","BP neural network","fever patient number","prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623061","abstract":"The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should contain at least 70 and at most 150 words.

Examples in some typical gradient based optimization settings support the result.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2091126","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5640365/05623300.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2091126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quaternion Gradient Operator and Its Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Quaternion Gradient Operator and Its Applications","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11691923","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5623300/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quaternion Gradient Operator and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"lsp-mandic-2091126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045012S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5640365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"5640365","articleId":"5623300","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5623303,"authors":[{"name":"Yogesh K.

This paper presents a fully-integrated switched-capacitor DC-DC converter in 45 nm digital CMOS technology. The proposed implementation uses digital capacitance modulation instead of traditional PFM and PWM control methods to maintain regulation against load current changes. This technique preserves constant frequency switching while also scaling switching and bottom-plate losses with changes in load current. Therefore, high efficiency can be achieved across different load current levels while maintaining a predictable switching noise behavior. The converter occupies only 0.16 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and operates from 1.8 V input.

Eight quad-threaded cores, operating at frequencies up to 4.14 GHz, are integrated together with two memory controllers and high speed system links on a 567 mm die, employing 1.2B transistors in a 45 nm CMOS SOI technology with 11 layers of low-k copper wiring. The technology features deep trench capacitors which are used to build a 32 MB embedded DRAM L3 based on a 0.067 m DRAM cell. The functionally equivalent chip transistor count would have been over 2.7B if the L3 had been implemented with a conventional 6 transistor SRAM cell. (A detailed paper about the eDRAM implementation will be given in a separate paper of this Journal). Deep trench capacitors are also used to reduce on-chip voltage island supply noise. This paper describes the organization of the design and the features of the processor core, before moving on to discuss the circuits used for analog elements, clock generation and distribution, and I/O designs. The final section describes the details of the clocked storage elements, including special features for test, debug, and chip frequency tuning.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"145","endPage":"161","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2080611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2080611","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5673672/05623304.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POWER7\u2122, a Highly Parallel, Scalable Multi-Core High End Server Processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623304/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"POWER7\u2122, a Highly Parallel, Scalable Multi-Core High End Server Processor","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704558","volume":"46","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5623304/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POWER7\u2122, a Highly Parallel, Scalable Multi-Core High End Server Processor","sourcePdf":"jssc-wendel-2080611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122374S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5623304","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5623309,"authors":[{"name":"Denis Amparo","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Amparo","id":"37573235700"},{"name":"Sergey K.

For more generality, we considered different coupling factors for the two coupled oscillators. This makes our analysis so general that we could design a phase and amplitude tunable quadrature oscillator accordingly. We show that choosing appropriate inversely proportional coupling factors makes it possible to have exactly zero phase and amplitude errors. Choosing so does not have any impacts on phase noise; indeed, the trade-off between phase noise and phase error in coupled quadrature oscillators has been broken here. We show that using differential stages for tuning tail currents of oscillating stages can somehow implement the inversely proportional coupling factors. Tuning the phase and amplitude errors, the frequency does not change and power consumption remains constant too; these are the advantages of the proposed circuit. The theoretical results and proposed quadrature oscillator are evaluated and confirmed through simulations using TSMC 0.18 model technology on a 5-GHz quadrature oscillator with current consumption of 4.2 mA at 1.8 V supply voltage.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Phase noise","Equations","Quality of service","Impedance","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit tuning","field effect MMIC","MMIC oscillators","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude tunable quadrature oscillator","phase tunable quadrature oscillator","closed form equation extraction","LC-tank","inverse proportional coupling factors","zero phase error","amplitude errors","phase noise","coupled quadrature oscillators","tail current tuning","power consumption","TSMC model technology","current consumption","CMOS LC-tank oscillators","size 0.18 mum","frequency 5 GHz","current 4.2 mA","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase noise","quadrature accuracy","RF CMOS","voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2073910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5739679/05623325.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2073910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Phase and Amplitude Tunable Quadrature - Oscillator: Analysis and Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Phase and Amplitude Tunable Quadrature <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex></formula> Oscillator: Analysis and Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623325/","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623325/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11903649","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phase and Amplitude Tunable Quadrature <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex></formula> Oscillator: Analysis and Design","sourcePdf":"tcsi-naimi-2073910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102823S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5739679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5739679","articleId":"5623325","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5623329,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

The EVM highlights modulation impairments caused by either the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) baseband transmit chain, filters, modulator, or amplifier linearity. EVM testing in production implies the use of high-cost test instrumentation in automated test equipment (ATE), which requires a complex I/Q baseband modulator supporting digital modulation and a built-in high-performance receiver. In this paper, an alternate EVM measurement technique is proposed that not only eliminates digital signal processing but also relies on standard continuous-wave (CW) tone measurements to evaluate the EVM performance of the device under test (DUT). The presented method comes at no extra test time cost since the EVM is computed from a series of CW tests, which are traditionally tested to guarantee the RF modulator yield in mass production. Assuming each EVM contributor is uncorrelated, the method consists of using simple sine-wave/cosine-wave input I/Q stimuli applied to the DUT to quantify each impairment and then compute each EVM contribution to finally derive the resulting composite EVM. The presented ATE EVM computation results are in excellent agreement with the laboratory EVM measurements using ATE conformance test equipment.

The trajectory, a set of spiral planes, is enhanced to accommodate motion tracking by adding orthogonal planes. Rigid-body motion tracking is accomplished by comparing the overlapping data and deducing the motion that is consistent with the comparisons. The accuracy of the proposed method is quantified for simulated data and for data collected using both a phantom and a volunteer. These tests were repeated to measure the effect of off-resonance blurring, coil sensitivity, gradient warping, undersampling, and nonrigid motion (e.g., neck). The artifacts of off-resonance, coils sensitivity, and gradient warping impose an unnotable effect on the accuracy of motion estimation. The worst mean accuracy is 0.15 and 0.20 mm for the phantom while the worst mean accuracy is 0.48 and 0.34 mm when imaging a brain, indicating that the nonrigid component in human subjects slightly degrades accuracy. When applied to in vivo motion, the proposed technique considerably reduces motion artifact.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2091146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5721862/05623347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2091146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5721862","startPage":"655","endPage":"665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rigid Body Motion Compensation for Spiral Projection Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rigid Body Motion Compensation for Spiral Projection Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11837871","pubMedId":"21062678","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5623347/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rigid Body Motion Compensation for Spiral Projection Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-johnson-2091146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069386S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5721862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5721862","articleId":"5623347","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5623385,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Chen","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281174300"},{"name":"Guofei Jiang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Guofei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37333652500"},{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293128900"},{"name":"Kenji Yoshihira","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Yoshihira","id":"37586761300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4250-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"5623385","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Optimization","Equations","System performance","Servers","Search problems","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configuration management","data mining","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative sampling","optimal configuration discovery","large scale computing system","configuration tuning","scalability issue","cooperative optimization framework","team playing behavior","performance evaluation","configuration search"]}],"abstract":"With the growing scale of current computing systems, traditional configuration tuning methods become less effective because they usually assume a small number of parameters in the system. In order to handle the scalability issue of configuration tuning, this paper proposes a cooperative optimization framework, which mimics the behavior of team playing to discover the optimal configuration setting in computing systems. We follow a `best of the best' rule to decompose the tuning task into a number of small subtasks with manageable size and complexity. While each decomposed module is responsible for the optimization of its own configuration parameters, all the modules share the performance evaluations of new samples as common feedbacks to enhance their optimization objectives. As a result, the qualities of generated samples become improved during the search, and the cooperative sampling will eventually discover the optimal configurations in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed cooperative optimization can identify better solutions within limited time periods compared with other state of the art configuration search methods. Such advantage becomes more significant when the number of configuration parameters increases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623378/5623379/05623385.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"120","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2010.21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperative Sampling Approach to Discovering Optimal Configurations in Large Scale Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Sampling Approach to Discovering Optimal Configurations in Large Scale Computing Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639177","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623385/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Sampling Approach to Discovering Optimal Configurations in Large Scale Computing Systems","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4250a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138617S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623378","isNumber":"5623379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623378","xplore-issue":"5623379","articleId":"5623385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5623390,"authors":[{"name":"Pelin Angin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Pelin","lastName":"Angin","id":"37586356500"},{"name":"Bharat Bhargava","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Bhargava","id":"37271936600"},{"name":"Rohit Ranchal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Ranchal","id":"37079211600"},{"name":"Noopur Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Noopur","lastName":"Singh","id":"37585967300"},{"name":"Mark Linderman","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Linderman","id":"37432355500"},{"name":"Lotfi Ben Othmane","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Lotfi Ben","lastName":"Othmane","id":"37586351200"},{"name":"Leszek Lilien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Lilien","id":"37283332500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4250-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"5623390","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Cloud computing","Privacy","Authentication","Protocols","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","security of data","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entity-centric approach","privacy management","identity management","cloud computing","user authentication","service providers","personally identifiable information","privacy policy","virtual machine","protection mechanism","anonymous identification","cloud services","identity data","untrusted host"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active bundles","cloud computing","identity management (IDM)","personally identifiable information (PII)","anonymous identification","zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)","privacy-enhancing technologies (PET)","privacy","security"]}],"abstract":"Entities (e.g., users, services) have to authenticate themselves to service providers (SPs) in order to use their services. An entity provides personally identifiable information (PII) that uniquely identifies it to an SP. In the traditional application-centric Identity Management (IDM) model, each application keeps trace of identities of the entities that use it. In cloud computing, entities may have multiple accounts associated with different SPs, or one SP. Sharing PIIs of the same entity across services along with associated attributes can lead to mapping of PIIs to the entity. We propose an entity-centric approach for IDM in the cloud. The approach is based on: (1) active bundles-each including a payload of PII, privacy policies and a virtual machine that enforces the policies and uses a set of protection mechanisms to protect themselves, (2) anonymous identification to mediate interactions between the entity and cloud services using entity's privacy policies. The main characteristics of the approach are: it is independent of third party, gives minimum information to the SP and provides ability to use identity data on untrusted hosts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Entity-Centric Approach for Privacy and Identity Management in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2010.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623378/5623379/05623390.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Entity-Centric Approach for Privacy and Identity Management in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623390/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639182","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Entity-Centric Approach for Privacy and Identity Management in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4250a177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066888S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623378","isNumber":"5623379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623378","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5623379","articleId":"5623390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623393,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Yilei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538317100"},{"name":"Michael R. lyu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Michael R.","lastName":"lyu","id":"37271654600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4250-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"5623393","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1164},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623393","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Indexes","Internet","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CloudRank","QoS driven component ranking framework","cloud computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS","cloud computing","component ranking"]}],"abstract":"The rising popularity of cloud computing makes building high quality cloud applications a critical and urgently required research problem. Component quality ranking approaches are crucial for making optimal component selection from a set of functionally equivalent component candidates. Moreover, quality ranking of cloud components helps the application designers detect the poor performing components in the complex cloud applications, which usually include huge number of distributed components. To provide personalized cloud component ranking for different designers of cloud applications, this paper proposes a QoS-driven component ranking framework for cloud applications by taking advantage of the past component usage experiences of different component users.

This highlights the problem of dependability in computer science contexts. High availability computing/clusters is a possible solution in such cases, implementing standby redundancy as a trade-off between dependability and costs. From the engineering perspective, this implies the use of specific techniques and tools for adequately evaluating the reliability/availability of high availability clusters, also taking into account dependencies among nodes (standby, repair, etc.) and the effect of wear and tear into such nodes, especially when failure and repair times are not exponentially distributed. The solution proposed in this paper is based on the use of phase type distributions and Kronecker algebra. In fact, we represent the reliability and maintainability of each component by specific phase type distributions, whose interactions describe the system availability. This latter is thus modeled by an expanded Markov chain expressed in terms of Kronecker algebra in order to face the state space explosion problem of expansion techniques and to represent the memory policies related to the aging process. More specifically, the paper firstly details the technique and then applies it to the evaluation of a standby redundant system representing a high availability cluster taken as example with the aim of demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, in order to show the potentiality of the technique, different maintenance strategies are evaluated and therefore compared.","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2010.37","startPage":"265","endPage":"274","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623378/5623379/05623401.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2010.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Availability Assessment of HA Standby Redundant Clusters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Maintenance engineering","Markov processes","Algebra","Redundancy","Aging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","Markov processes","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HA standby redundant clusters","availability assessment","high availability clusters","Kronecker algebra","Markov chain","state space explosion problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Reliability","Standby Redundancy","High Availability Clusters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"Availability Assessment of HA Standby Redundant Clusters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639193","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Availability Assessment of HA Standby Redundant Clusters","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4250a265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061565S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623378","isNumber":"5623379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623378","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5623379","articleId":"5623401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5623416,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Ranchal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Ranchal","id":"37079211600"},{"name":"Bharat Bhargava","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Bhargava","id":"37271936600"},{"name":"Lotfi Ben Othmane","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Lotfi Ben","lastName":"Othmane","id":"37586351200"},{"name":"Leszek Lilien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Lilien","id":"37283332500"},{"name":"Anya Kim","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Anya","lastName":"Kim","id":"37290903700"},{"name":"Myong Kang","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Myong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37287770700"},{"name":"Mark Linderman","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Linderman","id":"37432355500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4250-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"5623416","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2442},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection of Identity Information in Cloud Computing without Trusted Third Party","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Cryptography","Cloud computing","Privacy","Data privacy","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","Internet","middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity information protection","cloud computing","Internet based services","business processes support","IT services","data privacy","multiple service providers","sensitive identity information sharing","personally identifiable information","identity management","cloud security","trusted third party","data encryption","multiparty computing","middleware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active bundle","computing predicates","cloud computing","identity management system","multi-party computing","privacy","security"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing allows the use of Internet-based services to support business processes and rental of IT-services on a utility-like basis. It offers a concentration of resources but also poses risks for data privacy. A single breach can cause significant loss. The heterogeneity of \u201cusers\u201d represents a danger of multiple, collaborative threats. In cloud computing, entities may have multiple accounts associated with a single or multiple service providers (SPs). Sharing sensitive identity information (that is, Personally Identifiable information or PII) along with associated attributes of the same entity across services can lead to mapping of the identities to the entity, tantamount to privacy loss. Identity management (IDM) is one of the core components in cloud privacy and security and can help alleviate some of the problems associated with cloud computing. Available solutions use trusted third party (TTP) in identifying entities to SPs. The solution providers do not recommend the usage of their solutions on untrusted hosts. We propose an approach for IDM, which is independent of TTP and has the ability to use identity data on untrusted hosts. The approach is based on the use of predicates over encrypted data and multi-party computing for negotiating a use of a cloud service.

In addition to security concerns in wireless devices, deficiency in throughput and also increase in power consumption are introduced to the system by applying security. Therefore, designing a secure, high-speed wireless device with low power consumption would be a suitable response to worldwide demands. In this paper, we propose a solution to reduce encryption overhead and we almost eliminate it. Furthermore, a customized hardware architecture for Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) is proposed. This protocol is the fundamental security architecture of IEEE 802.11i standard. To improve throughput and reduce overhead, encryption is accomplished in the spare time intervals, such as DCF Inter-Frame Spaces (DIFS) used in IEEE 802.11i standard. In order to overcome the restrictions in dealing with these time intervals, a multi-core structure is proposed. Moreover, to reduce power consumption, a particular scheduler is implemented for processing cores. In the proposed architecture, we achieve up to 2Gbps throughput in the single core mode for MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit) and A-MSDU (Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit) input frames, and 17Gbps throughput in multi core mode for A-MPDU (Aggregated MPDU) input frames.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623530/","accessionNumber":"11639909","displayDocTitle":"High throughput low power CCMP architecture for very high speed wireless LANs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High throughput low power CCMP architecture for very high speed wireless LANs","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"31P65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069924S","chronDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610958","isNumber":"5623520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610958","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5623520","articleId":"5623530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5623572,"authors":[{"name":"Ren\u00e1ta Hodov\u00e1n","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e1ta","lastName":"Hodov\u00e1n","id":"37586367800"},{"name":"Zolt\u00e1n Herczeg","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zolt\u00e1n","lastName":"Herczeg","id":"37586365800"},{"name":"\u00c1kos Kiss","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"],"firstName":"\u00c1kos","lastName":"Kiss","id":"37560781400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8637-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8638-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4441"}],"articleNumber":"5623572","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Browsers","Engines","Web pages","Internet","Communities","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","Java","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular expressions","Web sites","server-client side scripting techniques","JavaScript","dynamic language","Web browsers","caching techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer languages","pattern matching","history"]}],"abstract":"On the web, static pages fade into the past; web sites use server and client-side scripting techniques to improve the user experience. For client-side scripting, JavaScript is by far the most commonly used dynamic language. In these scripts, regular expressions are widely used for several purposes, e.g., for text filtering and form validation. In this paper, we take a closer look at regular expressions on the web. We investigate historical data and determine the trends of the use of regular expressions over time on various web sites. Then, we also take a snapshot of the current status. We find that although regular expressions are being used more and more often, their use is highly repetitive: on the most popular web sites only 4% of the regular expressions are unique. Based on this result, we show that web browsers can cut down regular expression compilation time to the third by applying caching techniques.","doi":"10.1109/WSE.2010.5623572","publicationTitle":"2010 12th IEEE International Symposium on Web Systems Evolution (WSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th IEEE International Symposium on Web Systems Evolution (WSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611447/5623555/05623572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSE.2010.5623572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623555","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regular expressions on the web","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Regular expressions on the web","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623572/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-18 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637534","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623572/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regular expressions on the web","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"p29hodovan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07943S","chronDate":"17-18 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611447","isNumber":"5623555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611447","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5623555","articleId":"5623572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623592,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Yazdanpanah","affiliation":["Multimedia Processing Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Yazdanpanah","id":"37604751700"},{"name":"Mahmoud Reza Hashemi","affiliation":["Multimedia Processing Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud Reza","lastName":"Hashemi","id":"37288492900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6269-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6267-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6268-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-9361"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-937X"}],"articleNumber":"5623592","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":769},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Prediction algorithms","Hardware","Dictionaries","Engines","Real time systems","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["new compression ratio prediction algorithm","hardware implementations","LZW data compression","unprecedented pace","real time data compression systems","lossless data compression algorithms","data block","prediction algorithm","final compression ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Data Compression Engine","Lempel-Ziv-Welch","Compression Ratio Prediction"]}],"abstract":"As the demand for more data storage space continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, the need for real time data compression systems becomes more prominent. One of the well-known methods among lossless data compression algorithms is LZW. In this paper, a new prediction algorithm has been introduced that is able to predict whether or not a data block is compressible with the LZW method. Furthermore, the prediction algorithm provides a reasonably good estimation of the final compression ratio, hence helping the storage system decide early on whether or not to continue with the compression. Simulation results performed on several data compression corpuses indicate that the proposed prediction method is able to reduce run time by 17.79%, in average for a flash sector size of 8 KB. This is achieved at the expense of an average 1.59% decrease in compression performance. The difference between the predicted and actual compression ratio is 11.16% in average, in terms of mean absolute error. Considering the low computational complexity of the proposed method, it can be implemented with a relatively simple hardware hence making it suitable for real time, low-cost, and low-power hardware implementations.","doi":"10.1109/CADS.2010.5623592","publicationTitle":"2010 15th CSI International Symposium on Computer Architecture and Digital Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th CSI International Symposium on Computer Architecture and Digital Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610958/5623520/05623592.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADS.2010.5623592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623520","startPage":"155","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new compression ratio prediction algorithm for hardware implementations of LZW data compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new compression ratio prediction algorithm for hardware implementations of LZW data compression","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623592/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639928","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623592/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new compression ratio prediction algorithm for hardware implementations of LZW data compression","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"56P72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050049S","chronDate":"23-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610958","isNumber":"5623520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610958","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5623520","articleId":"5623592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5623612,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Balyan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Balyan","id":"37586248100"},{"name":"Davinder S Saini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Davinder S","lastName":"Saini","id":"37286234600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8663-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-004-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623612","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Delay","Complexity theory","Real time systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel allocation","code division multiple access","orthogonal codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code blocking","OVSF codes","WCDMA","immediate neighbor assignment","orthogonal variable spreading factor","code tree","code assignment strategy","code searches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OVSF codes","WCDMA","code blocking","code searches","code assignment","crowded first assignment"]}],"abstract":"Code blocking is a major problem in Orthogonal Variable Spreading factor (OVSF) codes. Low rates are scattered in code tree which leads to more code blocking for high rate users. The paper proposes an immediate neighbor busy code design which leads to less code blocking to different user rates, utilizing full capacity of parent codes. For a new call, the vacant code is optimum if the most of the capacity under the parent of the vacant code is already utilized. Subsequently the code is picked from the crowded part of the code tree. This ultimately creates lot of vacant portion in the code tree for higher rate calls. Our system architecture and code assignment strategy provides significant improvement in number of code searches (call processing delay) and complexity. Simulation results are demonstrated to show the superiority of the proposed design as compared to other existing schemes.","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623612.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","startPage":"155","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immediate neighbor assignment and reduction in code blocking for OVSF-WCDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Immediate neighbor assignment and reduction in code blocking for OVSF-WCDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623612/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637553","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623612/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immediate neighbor assignment and reduction in code blocking for OVSF-WCDMA","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"25305PID1475379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043757S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611454","isNumber":"5623609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611454","xplore-issue":"5623609","articleId":"5623612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5623654,"authors":[{"name":"Hoda Shah Mohammadian","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hoda Shah","lastName":"Mohammadian","id":"37392211800"},{"name":"Bahman Abolhassani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Bahman","lastName":"Abolhassani","id":"37088928689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8663-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-004-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623654","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623654","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Nash equilibrium","Cognitive radio","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Jacobian matrices","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","game theory","oligopoly","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["price-based spectrum sharing algorithm","cognitive radio networks","primary user","secondary user","licensed user","unlicensed user","radio resource usage","oligopoly market","Hackner utility function","frequency channel","channel price","Bertrand game","Nash equilibrium","static game","dynamic game"]}],"publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623654.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new price-based spectrum sharing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In a cognitive radio (CR) network, frequency spectrum can be shared between primary (or licensed) users and secondary (or unlicensed) users, where the secondary users (SUs) pay the primary users (PUs) for radio resource usage. In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum sharing in a cognitive radio environment in which multiple PUs with spectrum opportunities compete with each other to offer spectrum access to the only one SU. Each of the PUs aims to attract more demands from SU so there is a competition among PUs. This situation is formulated as an oligopoly market. For the SU, we adopt Hackner utility function to obtain the demands for the frequency channels (which have fixed bandwidth sizes). SU's demand for each channel is a function of its price. The novelty of this paper is that each channel price is the average of all offered prices by the PUs which can provide that channel. PUs' price competition for maximizing their own profit is modeled by the Bertrand game. Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We will consider two different cases: Static Game in which each PU can observe the adopted strategies and the profit of others and Dynamic Game in which the strategy of each PU is selected based on only the information obtained during the game. At the end, the stability condition for the dynamic spectrum sharing game is investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623654/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11637586","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623654/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new price-based spectrum sharing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new price-based spectrum sharing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"35251PID1444083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05886S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611454","isNumber":"5623609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611454","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5623609","articleId":"5623654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623660,"authors":[{"name":"Athar Qureshi","affiliation":["Medway School of Engineering, University of Greenwich, UK"],"firstName":"Athar","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"37602293200"},{"name":"Triantafyllos Kanakis","affiliation":["Medway School of Engineering, University of Greenwich, UK"],"firstName":"Triantafyllos","lastName":"Kanakis","id":"37297912300"},{"name":"Charan Litchfield","affiliation":["Medway School of Engineering, University of Greenwich, UK"],"firstName":"Charan","lastName":"Litchfield","id":"37403146000"},{"name":"Predrag Rapajic","affiliation":["Medway School of Engineering, University of Greenwich, UK"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Rapajic","id":"37280999500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8663-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-004-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623660","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Multiuser detection","Signal to noise ratio","Multiaccess communication","Mathematical model","Equations","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE","adaptive multiuser detection","asynchronous cooperative networks","CDMA","wireless network uplink transmission","data exchange","channel information","base station","diversity gains","MAI","linear adaptive filters","protocols","amplify and forward","decode and forward","A-MMSE-MUD","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Asynchronous cooperative CDMA wireless network uplink transmission is examined in this paper, where users cooperate in a relaying mode while they exchange data and channel information with the base station to achieve diversity gains. MAI occurs at both the relays and destination due to asynchronous transmission and non orthogonality of spreading waveform. In order to deal MAI, A-MMSE-MUD is been used by bank of linear adaptive filters. Two protocols of cooperative communication wireless networks are used, (i) amplify and forward at relays and A-MMSE-MUD at destination, (ii) A-MMSE-MUD at the relays and destination in a decode and forward operation. We compared our result with other multiuser detection schemes under same conditions in a cooperative communication wireless network and found that the amplify and forward scheme in use of A-MMSE-MUD remove the MAI even amplification is been performed on the relays nodes. Where as decode and forward scheme outperform all other multiuser detection scheme. Simulation experiments shows both schemes amplify and forward and decode and forward with A-MMSE-MUD provide significant improvement in the bit error rate and capacity performance of the cooperative communication CDMA networks.","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623660.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MMSE multiuser detection (A-MMSE-MUD) in asynchronous cooperative CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623660/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MMSE multiuser detection (A-MMSE-MUD) in asynchronous cooperative CDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637592","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623660/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MMSE multiuser detection (A-MMSE-MUD) in asynchronous cooperative CDMA networks","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"34440PID1448327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057675S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611454","isNumber":"5623609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611454","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5623609","articleId":"5623660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623667,"authors":[{"name":"Sanae El Hassani","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9 Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Sanae","lastName":"El Hassani","id":"37086891285"},{"name":"Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hamon","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9 Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","lastName":"Hamon","id":"37295794700"},{"name":"Pierre P\u00e9nard","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9 Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"P\u00e9nard","id":"37295796400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8663-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-004-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623667","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1517},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison study of binary and non-binary LDPC codes decoding","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623667.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Binary codes","Complexity theory","Schedules","Maximum likelihood decoding","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","error correction codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","non binary codes","decoding","error correcting codes","LDPC codes","LDPC decoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623667","abstract":"Non binary LDPC codes are promising error correcting codes which have increasingly raised interest in the last few years.

Despite the large additional complexity induced by non binary decoding, these codes are very promising since adapted complexity reduction techniques are already investigated and show interesting results.

M-SC-MPC codes are obtained as the serial concatenation of simple component codes, and their associated Tanner graph can be free of short length cycles. In this paper, we adopt a modified version of the Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm to improve the design of M-SC-MPC codes in terms of local cycles length. The proposed codes can be seen as M-SC-MPC codes where an interleaver is added between each pair of component codes; so we denote them as Permuted Serially Concatenated Multiple Parity-Check (P-SC-MPC) codes. We assess their performance through numerical simulations and compare them with previous solutions. We show that the proposed codes perform comparably or even better than both regular and irregular MSC-MPC codes and Quasi-Cyclic (QC) codes included in the IEEE 802.16e standard.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623671.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of permuted Serially Concatenated Multiple Parity-Check codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Generators","Redundancy","Decoding","Systematics","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","cyclic codes","graph theory","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permuted serially concatenated multiple parity-check codes","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","simple component codes","Tanner graph","progressive edge growth algorithm","local cycles length","quasi-cyclic codes","IEEE 802.16 standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","M-SC-MPC codes","PEG algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of permuted Serially Concatenated Multiple Parity-Check codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623671/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637603","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of permuted Serially Concatenated Multiple Parity-Check codes","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"33195PID1459953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046596S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611454","isNumber":"5623609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611454","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5623609","articleId":"5623671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5623690,"authors":[{"name":"Mois\u00e9s F.

In this paper it is proposed a novel model for network anomaly detection combining baseline, K-means clustering and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The baseline consists of network traffic normal behavior profiles, generated by the application of Baseline for Automatic Backbone Management (BLGBA) model in SNMP historical network data set, while K-means is a supervised learning clustering algorithm used to recognize patterns or features in data sets. In order to escape from local optima problem, the K-means is associated to PSO, which is a meta-heuristic whose main characteristics include low computational complexity and small number of input parameters dependence. The proposed anomaly detection approach classifies data clusters from baseline and real traffic using the K-means combined with PSO. Anomalous behaviors can be identified by comparing the distance between real traffic and cluster centroids. Tests were performed in the network of State University of Londrina and the obtained detection and false alarm rates are promising.","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2010, 18th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611454/5623609/05623690.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623609","startPage":"305","endPage":"309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection using baseline and K-means clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection using baseline and K-means clustering","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623690/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637622","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623690/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection using baseline and K-means clustering","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"29945PID1456863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053196S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611454","isNumber":"5623609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611454","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5623609","articleId":"5623690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5623694,"authors":[{"name":"Micaela Troglia Gamba","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Micaela Troglia","lastName":"Gamba","id":"37586243500"},{"name":"Guido Masera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Masera","id":"37296188300"},{"name":"Amer Baghdadi","affiliation":["Electronics Department, Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Amer","lastName":"Baghdadi","id":"37276706200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8663-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-004-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623694","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Decoding","Detectors","MIMO","Complexity theory","Iterative decoding","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MIMO detection","convergence analysis","flexibility analysis","soft-input soft-output list sphere decoding","linear MMSE detection","multiple-input multiple-output technology","wireless system standards","low-complexity suboptimal detection algorithms","extrinsic information transfer charts"]}],"abstract":"Iterative Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) detection and channel decoding offer significant improvement in error-rate performance for a reduced signal-to-noise ratio.

These forums are valuable sources for information about the users and their needs. Part of the success of open source projects depends on the collaboration and synergy of community members as they engage in active and productive discussions through posting comments, questions, and advice to online forums. However, the lack of feedback which occurs when initial posts go unanswered can negatively affect the users' perception of the project, and can subsequently impede adoption, create frustration, and lead to loss of opportunities from not understanding and satisfying the users' needs. This problem is quite common in open source forums. Our recent analysis of seven open source projects found that anywhere from 14% to 37% of user posts never get a reply. This paper directly addresses the problem of unanswered posts by presenting a hybrid recommender system that can be used to identify potential users who might be capable of responding to unanswered posts. The proposed system was evaluated using a statistical cross validation, and results show that it significantly outperformed a benchmark random recommender in terms of precision and recall. In addition, an informal analysis of the relationships between the users and the threads is presented to provide further evidence for the potential of recommender systems in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638138","htmlLink":"/document/5623811/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"27-27 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid recommender system for finding relevant users in open source forums","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid recommender system for finding relevant users in open source forums","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"06mark10submission5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063592S","chronDate":"27-27 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611788","isNumber":"5623807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611788","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5623807","articleId":"5623811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5623819,"authors":[{"name":"Aishwarya Nagarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Aishwarya","lastName":"Nagarajan","id":"37587642900"},{"name":"Michael J Schulte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Schulte","id":"37273849400"},{"name":"Parameswaran Ramanathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Parameswaran","lastName":"Ramanathan","id":"37283225000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9127-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0379-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623819","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Polynomials","Decoding","Encoding","Hardware","Computer architecture","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Galois fields","matrix algebra","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Galois field hardware architectures","high speed network coding","matrix inversions","Galois field dot products","GF matrix inversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","Content Distribution Networks","Galois field arithmetic","Matrix inversion","Gauss-Jordan elimination","Router designs"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents and analyzes novel hardware designs for high-speed network coding.

We investigate single cycle, multicycle, and pipelined designs with and without feedback mechanisms for encoding multiple sets of messages. The decoder is implemented as a multi-cycle design and performs GF matrix inversion followed by multiple GF dot products. Our designs are synthesized with a 65nm standard cell library and compared in terms of area, critical path delay, and throughput. Designs combining four messages achieve throughputs of more than 30 Gbps. Our designs can scale to achieve much higher throughput through the use of additional hardware.","doi":"10.1145/1872007.1872051","publicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611787/5623816/05623819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1872007.1872051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623816","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Galois field hardware architectures for network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Galois field hardware architectures for network coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623819/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638100","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623819/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Galois field hardware architectures for network coding","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a35Nagarajan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084393S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611787","isNumber":"5623816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611787","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5623816","articleId":"5623819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623834,"authors":[{"name":"Masanori Bando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Bando","id":"37408001900"},{"name":"N.

In addition, traffic is getting more concentrated to points such as data centers, and demand for protecting such high-speed networks from attack traffic is increasing. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611787/5623816/05623834.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","doi":"10.1145/1872007.1872032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1872007.1872032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5623834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range hash for regular expression pre-filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data structures","Throughput","Computer aided manufacturing","Complexity theory","Memory management","Doped fiber amplifiers","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["range hash architecture","regular expression prefiltering","Internet carriers","high-speed backbone network testing","Internet traffic demands","data centers","deep packet inspection","regular expression detection","network intrusions","exact strings","character classes","repetition matching","Snort signature","FPGA chips"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pre-Filter","Regular Expressions","Range Matching","Range Hash","Deep Packet Inspection","Network Intrusion Detection System","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Range hash for regular expression pre-filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5623834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638114","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range hash for regular expression pre-filtering","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a20bando.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09518S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611787","isNumber":"5623816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611787","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5623816","articleId":"5623834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623839,"authors":[{"name":"Danai Chasaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Danai","lastName":"Chasaki","id":"37595697900"},{"name":"Tilman Wolf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tilman","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37281966000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9127-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0379-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5623839","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boolean functions","Data structures","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Doped fiber amplifiers","Automata","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","binary decision diagrams","computer network security","field programmable gate arrays","finite automata","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast regular expression matching","NFA-BDD combination","network intrusion detection systems","network security threats","gigabit per second performance","parallelization","FPGA","ASIC","network processors","network speeds","nondeterministic finite automata","binary decision diagrams","hardware-based NIDS"]}],"abstract":"The development of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is nowadays a powerful solution to defend against various network security threats.

Conventional radio architectures are limited to narrow operating regions and fails to adapt with changing technology. This is further strengthened with the advent of cognitive radio, which needs a more versatile and flexible framework that is programmable within the timing constraints of a protocol. In this paper we present an architecture for Software Defined Cognitive Radio that caters to the specific baseband processing requirements in a changing environment. We aim to provide more flexibility by de-constructing the radio pipeline into a framework of user controlled kernels that can be reconfigured at run-time. This architecture provides the barebones of a OFDM based radio physical layer that can adapt to perform a varied number of tasks in different radio networks. We also present a novel message based real-time reconfiguration method to transmit and receive a wide range of waveforms used in concurrent wireless protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1872007.1872014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623816","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611787/5623816/05623845.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for Software Defined Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5623845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5623845/","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for Software Defined Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638125","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for Software Defined Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a05dutta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113408S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611787","isNumber":"5623816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611787","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5623816","articleId":"5623845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5623983,"authors":[{"name":"Huanran Wang","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Huanran","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599272500"},{"name":"Xiaoping P.

Spectrum handoff occurs when the owner of the spectrum or the primary user (PU) appears in the same channel that is already occupied by a secondary user (SU). In this case, the SU should vacate this channel and determine another free one. This process may continue till SU finishes its transmission. Spectrum handoff has a negative impact on the performance of SU in terms of delay and link maintenance; therefore the number of handoffs should be reduced. Opportunistic Spectrum Access with Backup channels (OSAB) is a new spectrum access concept for managing and increasing the spectrum capacity for ad hoc networks. Reducing the number of spectrum handoffs is one of the main features of OSAB. This is achieved by utilizing the unlicensed channels as backup channels in case of the appearance of the PUs. In this paper, an extensive mathematical model is presented to evaluate the performance of the OSAB in terms of the link maintenance probability and the expected number of spectrum handoffs. Numerical results show that OSAB outperforms the classical opportunistic spectrum access concept in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1040","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum handoff reduction for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624253/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum handoff reduction for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639688","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum handoff reduction for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"9133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07566S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5624254,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Gayosso-Rios","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, CINVESTAV, Mexicali, Mexico"],"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Gayosso-Rios","id":"38270156100"},{"name":"M.

That is because the inherent structure of OFDM means that certain input symbols will now be permanently lost (or nulled) with DDST. So here for the first time, we propose a DDST-like approach that can now be applied to OFDM - Symbol-Blanking Superimposed Training (SBST). We show that by the simple expedient of combining (prior to transmission) these nulled symbols with symbols at other subcarriers and proposing two new receiver detection algorithms, the performance of SBST can very closely approach the traditional pilot tone assisted modulation (PTAM) of OFDM - but without the concomitant reduction in data rate associated with PTAM.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624254","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-Blanking Superimposed Training for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-Blanking Superimposed Training for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624254/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639689","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-Blanking Superimposed Training for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"9278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071803S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624255,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Ghaffar","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Ghaffar","id":"37392200900"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624255","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"abstract":"We consider in this paper high spectral efficiency bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) MIMO system where, after serial to parallel conversion and per antenna coding, spatial data streams are simultaneously transmitted by using an antenna array. We carry out the performance analysis of an earlier proposed detection algorithm for such system which is based on the combination of linear and non linear detection techniques. This algorithm employs linear MMSE filters to detect the streams which have seen good channel realizations and therefore enjoy higher signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs). In the performance analysis, we show that the detection of these streams suffer from the loss of diversity order. These streams, after being detected, are subsequently stripped off leading to the max log MAP detection of the streams which have seen comparatively poor realizations of the channel and consequently have lower SNRs. We further show that these streams are benefited from the additional diversity order in the detection. Key idea is therefore to lower the detection complexity at the cost of reduced diversity order for the streams benefiting from good channel realizations and to enhance diversity order at the cost of increased detection complexity for the streams suffering from poor channel realizations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624255.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"853","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of low complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","filtering theory","interleaved codes","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity soft detection","MIMO system","bit interleaved coded modulation","serial to parallel conversion","per antenna coding","spatial data","antenna array","linear detection techniques","nonlinear detection techniques","linear MMSE filters","signal-to-noise-ratios","max log MAP detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","BICM","Max log MAP detector","MMSE detector","Pair wise error probability analysis","Low complexity detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of low complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624255/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639690","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of low complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO system","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"9314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042714S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624257,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37596284400"},{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electonics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310448100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624257","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Throughput","Fading","Multiuser detection","Signal to noise ratio","Time frequency analysis","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast frequency hopping","dynamic multiple access","cognitive radios","suboptimum noncoherent","maximum-likelihood multiuser detection","frequency shift keying","cognitive radio users","interweave paradigm","bit error rate","Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel dynamic multiple-access (DMA) scheme for application in cognitive radios (CRs).

In our studies, we assume that the primary users (PUs) and the cognitive radio users (CRUs) are operated in the interweave paradigm. The PUs activate to communicate according to a Poisson process and the duration of an activation obeys exponential distribution. The bit error rate (BER) and throughput performance of the dynamic FFH/MFSK systems are investigated by simulations, when assuming communications over Rayleigh fading channels. Our studies and simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic FFH/MFSK with suboptimum noncoherent ML-MUD constitutes one of the promising candidates for DMA in CRs.

In this situation, due to geometry, the problem of unavoidable differences in time of arrival between the users' signals occurs. As a result, symbol timing offsets can be larger than the cyclic prefix, which leads to OFDM inter-symbol interference. In addition to the multiuser interference, a coupling between adjacent subcarriers and consecutive OFDM symbols is induced in such scenarios. In this paper, we analyze the multi-user joint detection performance in systems with distance dependent asynchronous interference and pathloss environments for different channel delays as well as fixed cyclic prefix length. To this end we use an exact expression for the post equalization SINR that is used for the evaluation in numerical simulations. The system level cell setup considers two user positioning models based on a hexagonal cell geometry with varying cell radii.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISI analysis in network MIMO OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix length","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624259","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624259.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"ISI analysis in network MIMO OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix length","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624259/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISI analysis in network MIMO OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix length","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"9078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060498S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624260,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9sar A.

The aim of these schemes, working together with time and frequency domain packet scheduling, is to achieve reuse of 1 at sector level in a trisectorized base station scenario. Inter-sector interference is strong at the frontier between sectors and a tight coordination scheme needs be applied. To support this coordination scheme, the users' positioning information is then essential to determine if a user is prone to suffer strong inter-sector interference.

The FCC made the rules and regulation for using the TVWS. Till now there is no real deployment of any communication system that operates on TVWS. As the first step towards the deployment of a communication system that operates on TVWS, we developed a UHF band CR test-bed based on ECMA-392 international standard. ECMA-392 standard defines the MAC and PHY for operation in TVWS for communication between portable devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of our test-bed system in detail.

This is due to the inappropriate spatial filter design at the BS based on the reverse link estimate. Hence, BS transceiver calibration is required. Provided that an estimate of the forward link channel is available at the BS, e.g., in a calibration phase, the transceiver parameters can be estimated by solving a total least squares (TLS) problem. In addition, if mutual coupling between the antennas exists the number of unknown front-end parameters to be estimated increases. Consequently, large matrices need to be decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD) to attain a calibrated system. To deal with these large matrices a conjugate gradient (CG) method for solving the TLS problem iteratively is proposed in this paper.

The first sub-block serves to estimate the Doppler scaling factor while the pilots in the second sub-block are used for estimating the equivalent channel.

This operation allows the DODs of the multiple paths to be estimated at the Rx by making a set of power measurements. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated using computer simulation studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11639737","htmlLink":"/document/5624303/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-departure estimation using cooperative beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-departure estimation using cooperative beamforming","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"9975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061758S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624307,"authors":[{"name":"Haitao Zhao","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290335700"},{"name":"Emiliano Garcia-Palacios","affiliation":["ECIT Institute, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Garcia-Palacios","id":"38274417300"},{"name":"Yong Xi","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xi","id":"37288820300"},{"name":"Jibo Wei","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jibo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279094700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624307","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Resource management","Throughput","Ad hoc networks","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multihop cooperative MIMO systems","ad hoc networks","multiple input multiple output systems","antenna arrays","wireless communication systems","Shannon capacity limit"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) allows multiple nodes to emulate antenna arrays and transmit or receive cooperatively.

To solve this problem, evolutionary algorithm Particle Swarm optimization' (PSO) is considered. The distributed clustered cellular networks with clusters having local macrodiversity are considered and the effect of frequency planning by Particle Swarm Optimization is analyzed by observing the sum rate. The reason of considering PSO is its simple computational nature and property of quick convergence towards optimal solution. Here, PSO for discrete search space is implemented for frequency allocation, the iterative updates are performed to get optimized frequency allocation. The results of frequency allocation by PSO have shown considerable improvement in system sum rate capacity in comparison to some of the conventional allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624316","startPage":"646","endPage":"650","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624316.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency planning of clustered cellular network using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Resource management","Equations","Base stations","Interference","Planning","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","frequency allocation","particle swarm optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustered cellular network","particle swarm optimization","PSO","frequency planning","bandwidth allocation","intercell interference","macrodiversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Frequency planning of clustered cellular network using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639748","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency planning of clustered cellular network using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"6939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074077S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624317,"authors":[{"name":"Ferkan Yilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ferkan","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37408923000"},{"name":"O\u011fuz Kucur","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624317","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an analytical framework on the exact computation of the average symbol error probabilities (ASEP) of multihop transmission over generalized fading channels when an arbitrary number of amplify-and-forward relays is used.

The numerical results show that the gains in terms of throughput, with respect to the typical methods, can be as large as 5 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-I HARQ scheme using LDPC codes and partial retransmissions for AWGN and quasi static fading channels","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624326","startPage":"571","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624326.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Type-I HARQ scheme using LDPC codes and partial retransmissions for AWGN and quasi static fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624326/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639755","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-I HARQ scheme using LDPC codes and partial retransmissions for AWGN and quasi static fading channels","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"3086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069906S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624328,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Delestre","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Herfordshire, Hartfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Delestre","id":"37594945800"},{"name":"Yichuang Sun","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Herfordshire, Hartfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Yichuang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278741400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624328","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"abstract":"In this paper, channel estimation for Space-Time Block Code (STBC) - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated for Mobile WiMax systems.

Therefore, a flexible and reliable software and hardware architecture based on the software-defined radio (SDR) paradigm is a meaningful concept. SDRs have paved the way towards cognitive radios (CR), which are based on SDRs that additionally sense their environments, track changes, and react upon their findings. A CR is an autonomous unit in a communications environment that frequently exchanges information with the networks it is able to access as well as with other CRs. A tool is required for the description and design of the multitude of concurrent processing tasks running on the CR. Petri nets are both a simple and strong solution and are recommendable to deploy them for these demands. In this manuscript, the authors present a concept for a CR as well as the hardware demonstrator realization. This demonstrator was developed by the authors and makes use of a digital signal processor (DSP) in combination with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

However, this is not true in most practical situations and, in order to avoid the serious performance degradation that occurs when the CIR length is underestimated, a channel with \"more than enough\" taps is usually considered. This very frequently leads to overestimating the channel order, which increases the computational complexity of any maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) algorithm, while degrading its performance at the same time. The problem of estimating a single channel order for a time and frequency selective MIMO channel has recently been tackled. However, this is an idealized approach, since a MIMO channel comprises multiple subchannels (as many as the number of inputs times that of the outputs), each of them possibly with its own order. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for MLSD that incorporates the full estimation of the MIMO CIR parameters, including one channel order per output. The proposed technique is based on the per survivor processing (PSP) methodology, it admits both blind and semiblind implementations, depending on the availability of pilot data, and it is designed to work with time-selective channels. Besides the analytical derivation of the algorithm, we provide computer simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the resulting receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624335","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624335.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"451","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MLSD for MIMO transmission systems with unknown subchannel orders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MLSD for MIMO transmission systems with unknown subchannel orders","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624335/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639767","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624335/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MLSD for MIMO transmission systems with unknown subchannel orders","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"3440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051185S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624337,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37396760300"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280172300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624337","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Interference","Training","Noise","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization","OFDM","spectrum sharing system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","narrow band interference"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sharing is promising to improve the efficiency of spectrum usage.

We consider the cross-correlation based timing synchronization and propose a pre-filter to mitigate the NBI effect. Based on the theoretical analysis of miss detection and false alarm probabilities of the cross-correlation based synchronization algorithm, the pre-filter parameters can be devised by exploiting the stationary property of the NBI and the additive thermal noise.

Our proposed algorithm provides a higher degree of diversity in the search process by virtue of its particular improvisation procedure, as opposed to evolutionary computation techniques used so far for this optimization problem. In our work both centralized and distributed implementations of our approach are proposed and detailed. The first set of simulation results made for one single HS instance running over a fixed network show, on one hand, that our approach achieves near-optimum spectral channel assignments at a very low computational complexity. On the other hand, satisfactory results obtained for a distributed implementation of our algorithm pave the way for future research aimed at comparing our approach with avantgarde genetically-inspired spectrum allocation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624341","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624341.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624341","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","startPage":"233","endPage":"237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Harmony Search based spectrum allocation technique for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel Harmony Search based spectrum allocation technique for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624341/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639773","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Harmony Search based spectrum allocation technique for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"3568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070112S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624343,"authors":[{"name":"Anke Schmeink","affiliation":["UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37391595400"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"},{"name":"Haoqing Zhang","affiliation":["UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Haoqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37600245300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Noise","Mutual information","Additives","Optimization","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","radio receivers","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signaling point constellation","peak power constraints","discrete capacity-achieving distribution","receiver design","channel quality","channel capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624343","abstract":"Imposing so called peak power constraints on the input of a channel in many cases leads to a discrete capacity-achieving distribution with finite support.

Two criteria are maximized, channel capacity and cutoff rate.

In frequency division duplex systems it is beneficial to have the knowledge of the uplink channel and the downlink channel at both sides of the point-to-point transmission link. However, the base station can only estimate the uplink channel based on the transmission of a-priori known training signals from the mobile station. Due to the frequency selective behavior of the mobile radio channel, the channel state information of the uplink channel and the channel state information of the downlink channel are different. One possibility to obtain the channel state information of the downlink channel in the base station is to feed back this information from the mobile station. Unfortunately, this feedback decreases the spectral efficiency. The presented techniques to obtain the channel state information of the downlink channel in the base station are based on the physical path parameters and are based on filtering the previously estimated channel state information. The performance of the investigated techniques is evaluated by means of measurement results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624346.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel prediction in point-to-point MIMO-systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Downlink","Channel models","Antenna arrays","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel prediction","point-to-point MIMO systems","channel transfer function","frequency division duplex MIMO system","uplink channel estimation","downlink channel estimation","point-to-point transmission link","base station","mobile station","priori known training signals","channel state information","mobile radio channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel prediction in point-to-point MIMO-systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624346/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639778","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel prediction in point-to-point MIMO-systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"3854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048115S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624348,"authors":[{"name":"Liaoyuan Zeng","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Centre, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liaoyuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37306352700"},{"name":"Sean McGrath","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Centre, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"McGrath","id":"37268366100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624348","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Heuristic algorithms","Sensors","Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Loading","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum efficiency optimization","multiuser ultra wideband cognitive radio networks","dynamic spectrum access algorithm","aggregate interference power","UWB fading channel","Fenton-Wilkinson method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624348","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624348.pdf","startPage":"1006","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum efficiency optimization in multiuser Ultra Wideband cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new dynamic spectrum access algorithm in multiuser Ultra Wideband cognitive radio networks for spectrum efficiency optimization.

In this paper, we present a two-step resource allocation solution for multiuser based CR systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The solution allocates the subcarriers to SUs in the first step, considering proportional fairness. In the second step, the solution allocates the power to the subcarriers to maximize sum capacity of all SUs, without causing excessive interference to the primary users (PUs). Simulation results and performance analysis show that our proposed solution can offer a beneficial efficiency-versus-fairness tradeoff, while largely reducing computation cost compared to the existing solution.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624351","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"996","endPage":"1000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-step resource allocation in multiuser OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A two-step resource allocation in multiuser OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624351/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639783","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624351/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-step resource allocation in multiuser OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055273S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624356,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Daniel","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Daniel","id":"37541723600"},{"name":"Markus Putzke","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Putzke","id":"37596561400"},{"name":"Bjoern Dusza","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Bjoern","lastName":"Dusza","id":"37595101800"},{"name":"Christian Wietfeld","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wietfeld","id":"37353607200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624356","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":846},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624356","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Channel models","Ray tracing","Mobile communication","Base stations","Atmospheric modeling","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","battery powered vehicles","cellular radio","micromechanical devices","ray tracing","remotely operated vehicles","secondary cells","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional channel characterization","low altitude aerial vehicles","lithium polymer batteries","carbon fiber-reinforced plastic materials","micro unmanned aerial vehicles","aerial mesh networks","cellular networks","MUAV swarms","raytracing measurements"]}],"abstract":"Based on the recent developments in the area of lithium polymer batteries and carbon fiber-reinforced plastic materials Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV) have significantly gained in importance. Therefore, the use of MUAV based swarms is a feasible approach for remote sensing, surveillance and in particular for emergency and rescue missions [1][2]. Developing MUAVs which operate at low altitudes opens a new and challenging use case for both aerial mesh networks and existing cellular networks. The channel characteristics are crucial for the design of the required communication system. Since channel models for cellular networks typically assume that the users are at ground level, the use of these models for aerial deployment is a questionable attempt. For this reason, we are focusing in this paper on the channel characterization and analysis of an aerial mesh network based on a MUAV swarms. A choice of well known analytical and empirical channel models are adapted to the boundary conditions of low altitude platforms and subsequently validated by raytracing measurements in order to state their applicability.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624356","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624356.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three dimensional channel characterization for low altitude aerial vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Three dimensional channel characterization for low altitude aerial vehicles","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639787","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624356/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three dimensional channel characterization for low altitude aerial vehicles","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048632S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624358,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk W\u00fcbben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"W\u00fcbben","id":"37269338400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624358","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Relays","Network coding","Parity check codes","Joints","Phase shift keying","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","iterative decoding","network coding","parity check codes","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel decoding","physical layer network coding","two-way QPSK relay systems","generalized sum-product algorithm","low density parity check codes","LDPC codes","error correction codes","iterative decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624358","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624358.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel decoding and physical-layer network coding in two-way QPSK relay systems by a generalized Sum-Product Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624358","abstract":"A physical-layer network coded two-way relay system applying Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes for error correction is considered in this paper, where two sources A and B desire to exchange information with each other by the help of a relay R.

The advantage of the GMMSE detector is, that it does not require the knowledge of the noise power. However, the computational complexity of the GMMSE detector is significantly higher than the computational complexity of the MMSE detector. Using the circular approximation of the Toeplitz structured system matrix an approximate GMMSE detector can be derived, whose computational complexity is only slightly higher than MMSE, i.e. only an iterative gradient descent algorithm based on the inversion of diagonal matrices is additionally required. The performance of this approximate GMMSE detector is analysed by investigating the noise enhancement due to the conditioning of the system matrix (Toeplitz) and its circular approximation. Simulation results for fading multipath channels are given and the computational complexity is briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624379","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","startPage":"496","endPage":"500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624379.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Least squares approximation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","fading channels","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity generalized minimum mean square error detector","bit error rate performance","computational complexity","iterative gradient descent algorithm","diagonal matrices","noise enhancement","fading multipath channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a reduced complexity generalized Minimum Mean Square Error detector","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624379/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624379/","accessionNumber":"11639618","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a reduced complexity generalized Minimum Mean Square Error detector","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"4768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071067S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5624381,"authors":[{"name":"Dick Carrillo","affiliation":["PUC Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Dick","lastName":"Carrillo","id":"37589150900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624381","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"The main problems of multiple carriers that pass through non-linear devices are: a Nonlinear AM / AM conversion, a Nonlinear AM / PM conversion, and inter-modulation. These problems are usually present in satellite transmissions, where high-power amplifiers (HPAs) and nonlinear transponders are used, as well as in terrestrial broadcasting systems where, in order to enlarge the service area (geographical area in which the service is offered) High-power amplifiers operating in their Nonlinear region are used. The multi-carrier transmission called OFDM, which is widely used in wireless networks as WiMAX and LTE, falls in this context. In order to alleviate the effects of Nonlinear channels on OFDM signals, the present study suggests the use of a pre-distortion system, which is mathematically described through a complex power series. The Strategy is focused in determine the parameters of the pre-distortion system, which is based on the reduction of the inter-modulation power sum associated to inter-modulation products of any specified order. Analysis of configurations based on this strategy is presented with numerical results involving situations of specific interest.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624381.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"921","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of intermodulation products of superior order generated by Nonlinear systems over OFDM signals using a pre-distortion technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Mathematical model","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear distortion","Equations","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermodulation","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","transponders","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermodulation products reduction","nonlinear systems","OFDM signals","pre-distortion technique","non-linear devices","nonlinear AM/AM conversion","nonlinear AM/PM conversion","satellite transmissions","high-power amplifiers","nonlinear transponders","terrestrial broadcasting systems","multi-carrier transmission","wireless networks","WiMAX","LTE","nonlinear channels","pre-distortion system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Non-linear systems","Pre-distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of intermodulation products of superior order generated by Nonlinear systems over OFDM signals using a pre-distortion technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624381/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639620","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of intermodulation products of superior order generated by Nonlinear systems over OFDM signals using a pre-distortion technique","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"4832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050973S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624382,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Daniel","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute CNI, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Daniel","id":"37541723600"},{"name":"Sebastian Rohde","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute CNI, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Rohde","id":"37548008700"},{"name":"Niklas Goddemeier","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute CNI, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Niklas","lastName":"Goddemeier","id":"37541724600"},{"name":"Christian Wietfeld","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute CNI, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wietfeld","id":"37353607200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624382","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Mobile communication","Heuristic algorithms","Conferences","Chemicals","Robot sensing systems","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","mobile computing","remotely operated vehicles","wireless mesh networks","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel aware mobility","self organizing wireless sensor swarms","low altitude platforms","mobile sensors","chemical plume detection","cognitive network","sensor aided mesh network","agent-based methodology","communication aware mobility behavior"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624382","abstract":"Based on the recent developments in the area of lithium polymer batteries and carbon fiber-reinforced plastic materials Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV) significantly gain in importance. The use of cognitive MUAV swarms for distributing mobile sensors is a significant value add for chemical plume detection in rescue missions and also in particular for remote sensing and surveillance purposes. The objective of our proposed cognitive and sensor aided mesh network is to maximize the spatial sensing coverage on the one hand and the connectivity between the cooperative MUAVs on the other. Next to these contrary optimization goals we developed bio-inspired algorithms seeking concurrently for a global target and a coherent topology of the swarm in order to avoid self-separations. In this paper we particularly focus on an agent-based methodology for communication aware mobility behavior of self-organizing MUAVs at high vehicular speeds which provoke fast topology changes and lead to a transient aerial mesh network. To determine the key figures of the system, the performance of dynamically adapted mobility algorithms is analyzed and compared under lognormal channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624382","startPage":"145","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624382.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Aware mobility for self organizing wireless sensor swarms based on low altitude platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel Aware mobility for self organizing wireless sensor swarms based on low altitude platforms","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624382/","accessionNumber":"11639622","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624382/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Aware mobility for self organizing wireless sensor swarms based on low altitude platforms","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"4941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064946S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5624383,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Zheng","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37593236100"},{"name":"Hailan Peng","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hailan","lastName":"Peng","id":"37592361500"},{"name":"Takeo Fujii","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624383","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Receivers","Downlink","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband prechannel compensation","MC-CDMA downlink relay system","multicarrier code division multiple access","downlink communication","cell edge","frequency selective fading channels","frequency domain equalization","receiver","bit error rate","BER","multiaccess interference","channel compensation method","frequency domain diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a relay system for a downlink communication of multi carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) to improve the performance of cell-edge. However since different signals from the base station and the relay station affect different frequency-selective fading channels, the use of frequency-domain equalization at a receiver cannot restore the orthogonality of these signals. Therefore, bit error rate (BER) performance severely degrades due to large multiaccess interference (MAI). We have proposed a channel compensation method at the relay station for MC-CDMA to improve the performance of the downlink relay system. In this method, the channel response from the relay station to the terminal is compensated to be the same channel response from the base station to the terminal at the receiver terminal. Therefore, MAI can be reduced and BER performance is improved. However, the compensation causes the problem of reducing the effect of frequency domain diversity gain by using relay station. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a sub-band pre-channel compensation at the relay station for MC-CDMA downlink relay system to obtain the diversity gain.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624383","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"61","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-band pre-channel compensation-at RS for MC-CDMA downlink relay system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-band pre-channel compensation-at RS for MC-CDMA downlink relay system","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624383/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639619","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624383/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-band pre-channel compensation-at RS for MC-CDMA downlink relay system","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"4959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062294S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624385,"authors":[{"name":"Junruo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Junruo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407601800"},{"name":"Yuriy V.

Due to the negative effect of non-orthogonal multiplexing of SI pilots, various algorithms have been developed in order to enhance the channel estimation accuracy. Probably the most promising approaches include an additional feedback from pre-detected data symbols. This, however, increases the computational complexity of the receiver. Inspired by some recent studies related to block-transmission scenarios, we propose a novel channel estimation method applicable to narrowband systems. The method is based on preprocessing the signal waveform already in the transmitter. Furthermore, no additional feedback loop is required in the receiver. It is shown by analytic derivations and computer simulations that the proposed approach has considerable benefits over other available methods in the literature.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624397.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624397","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624397","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference","Silicon","Receivers","Interpolation","Estimation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","fading channels","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","time-varying flat fading channel","interference avoidance","superimposed pilots","insertion method","time division multiplexing pilots","nonorthogonal multiplexing","data symbol predetection","computational complexity","transmitters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624397/","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation in time-varying flat-fading channel using superimposed pilots with interference avoidance","accessionNumber":"11639636","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624397/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation in time-varying flat-fading channel using superimposed pilots with interference avoidance","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"5991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059896S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624398,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Spyridis","affiliation":["Hellenic Naval Academy, Salamina, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Spyridis","id":"38556942600"},{"name":"Clark Robertson","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Clark","lastName":"Robertson","id":"38201255900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624398","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","High definition video","AWGN","Encoding","Interference","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance simulation","alternative automatic link establishment","Link 16/JTIDS waveform","Reed Solomon encoding","hybrid soft decision-hard decision decoding","Reed-Solomon code","code symbols","bandwidth efficient modulation","Link 16/joint tactical information distribution system","orthogonal signaling","pulse noise interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624398","abstract":"Hybrid hard decision-soft decision (HD/SD) decoding is a novel decoding technique for Reed Solomon (RS) codes. HD/SD decoding utilizes traditional hard decision RS decoding where the received block is either decoded correctly or a decoding failure exists. In the event of a decoding failure, channel reliability information is used to identify received code symbols with a low probability of being correctly received and to generate new code symbol estimates that are used in the traditional RS decoding algorithm. HD/SD RS decoding was developed for use with bandwidth efficient modulation schemes such as M-ary phase-shift keying and has been examined only in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment. This paper presents the performance simulation and analysis of proposed alternative waveforms for Automatic Link Establishment and the Link-16/Joint Tactical Information Distribution System utilizing orthogonal signaling and Reed Solomon (RS) encoding. The proposed modulation scheme is double-symbol 8-FSK, where two modulation symbols are used to transmit a single RS code symbol, and hybrid HD/SD decoding. In addition to AWGN, the effects of pulse-noise interference (PNI) are considered. An interesting result is that hybrid HD/SD decoding has better performance and error correction capability than either traditional HD decoding or other RS SD techniques that have been examined in the literature, especially when PNI is present. The proposed alternative waveforms provide more robust communication links and increased throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624398","startPage":"839","endPage":"843","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624398.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance simulation and analysis of alternative Automatic Link Establishment and Link-16/JTIDS waveforms with Reed Solomon encoding and hybrid soft decision-hard decision decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance simulation and analysis of alternative Automatic Link Establishment and Link-16/JTIDS waveforms with Reed Solomon encoding and hybrid soft decision-hard decision decoding","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624398/","accessionNumber":"11639637","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624398/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance simulation and analysis of alternative Automatic Link Establishment and Link-16/JTIDS waveforms with Reed Solomon encoding and hybrid soft decision-hard decision decoding","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"6037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048474S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624399,"authors":[{"name":"Junruo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Junruo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407601800"},{"name":"Rami N.

The simulation results illustrate that users can efficiently approximate the predetermined target data rate by means of the proposed game approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1005","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624401.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio for UWB spectrum sharing and power allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624401/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio for UWB spectrum sharing and power allocation","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639640","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio for UWB spectrum sharing and power allocation","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"6218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054222S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624402,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A Chip level DFE-based receiver is optimized using the mean square error criterion (MSE), which is generated by exchanging soft information in terms of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) estimates with each user's channel decoder. Soft Rake-based conventional IDMA receiver in conjunction with the soft channel estimation is also adopted iteratively using regenerated multiple access interference (MAI) signal. In both receivers, carrier phase tracking is optimized jointly and detection is implemented using soft chip cancellation to remove multi access interference (MAI) effects between users. The receivers' equations describing the detection algorithms are derived, and their performance is investigated in short range shallow water acoustic channels using signals acquired during sea-trials in the North Sea. Results for synchronous multi-user scenarios with 2 and 4 users, at an effective rate of 439.5 bps per user, demonstrate that the DFE-based IDMA receiver outperforms the standard soft Rake IDMA receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624402","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624402.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of IDMA receivers for underwater acoustic channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of IDMA receivers for underwater acoustic channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624402/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639641","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of IDMA receivers for underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"6309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063517S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624403,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Mezghani","affiliation":["Institute of Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"37294420600"},{"name":"Nesrine Damak","affiliation":["Institute of Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nesrine","lastName":"Damak","id":"37595149600"},{"name":"Josef A.

In the context of battery operated short range communication, where low power, low cost and small size are key requirements (e.g. standard IEEE 802.15.4), this circuit aware system optimization is crucial given the growing importance of \"Green Communication\". In fact, the transmit power in such applications reaches values in the order of or is even smaller than the power dissipation of certain analog components along the signal path. Using an appropriate information-theoretic framework we derive the optimal bit-resolution of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), the optimal choice of the noise figure for the low noise amplifier (LNA) and the optimal operating input back-off (IBO) of the Power Amplifier (PA) as a function of the path-loss (i.e. the communication distance).

Further, we develop a timer mechanism to achieve round-robin, max-min and proportional fairness for intra-class scheduling in a CRN. The case of inter-class fairness is a addressed by defining a time bias to prioritize the resource access of primary links.

In this work, the authors build on the genetic algorithm multi-spot diffuse technique [1] by adaptively optimising the power distribution among the radiating spots. Our goal is to reduce the effect of intersymbol interference and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the system operates under strong background noise and multipath dispersion. This method can deliver superior SNR and delay spread results compared to other existing systems. This paper also examines the boundaries of the maximum SNR that can be achieved in an indoor wireless system. It is demonstrated that the SNR can improve by as much as 50 dB compared to conventional diffuse systems paving the way for faster and more power efficient communication links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624406/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11639644","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624406/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimisation of mobile indoor infrared systems through genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimisation of mobile indoor infrared systems through genetic algorithms","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"6533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052039S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624407,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The more knowledge a CR can acquire about primary user (PU) systems, the better it can plan its radio activities. Ideally, it would like to classify the PU systems with respect to `known standards' so that the documented knowledge of PU systems can be usefully utilized. Intensive research has been done in the area of signal classification but merely with respect to modulations. We present a novel neuro-fuzzy signal classifier (NFSC) to classify signals with respect to known standards. The NFSC demonstrates excellent performance by using modern A/D based wideband data acquisition as well as traditional heterodyne narrowband transceivers in real-time coexistence environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624411/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11639647","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624411/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neuro-fuzzy signal classifier (NFSC) for standard wireless technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuro-fuzzy signal classifier (NFSC) for standard wireless technologies","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04175S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5624465,"authors":[{"name":"Janos Toth","affiliation":["Strategic Research and Development, British-Columbia Transmission Corporation, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5604773/5624409/5624465/5624465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Janos Toth works at the British Columbia Transmission Corporation, BC, Canada.

This paper reviews some of the possible applications of UAS in BCTC for routine and emergency line inspections and discusses the required system features based on internal research and needs assessments. A high level review of public literature also introduces some commercially available UAS with varying capacity, sophistication and autonomy. As pointed out in this paper, feature standardization as well as collaboration with regulators is required if UAS are to achieve widespread civilian commercial use.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624409","publicationTitle":"2010 1st International Conference on Applied Robotics for the Power Industry","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 1st International Conference on Applied Robotics for the Power Industry","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604773/5624409/05624465.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CARPI.2010.5624465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CARPI.2010.5624465","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart view for a smart grid \u2014 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transmission lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624465/","displayDocTitle":"Smart view for a smart grid \u2014 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transmission lines","htmlLink":"/document/5624465/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11637503","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart view for a smart grid \u2014 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transmission lines","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"CARPI2010cd0689PID1375043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052367S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604773","isNumber":"5624409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604773","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5624409","articleId":"5624465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624484,"authors":[{"name":"Rabah W.

Our analysis demonstrates that although the gain of single-antenna selection is superior to that of Alamouti encoded transmissions, this advantage diminishes quickly with increasing numbers of transmit and/or receive antennas. Specifically, we show that the diversity orders of the two schemes are identical, and there is less than 1 dB difference in the coding gains when more than two transmit antennas are employed. Consequently, one can still achieve performance close to that of single-antenna selection in systems that only support Alamouti coding by employing transmit antenna subset selection on a per-tone basis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624487.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of per-tone transmit antenna selection in OFDM systems with Alamouti coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Gain","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["per-tone transmit antenna selection","OFDM systems","Alamouti coding","diversity gains","single antenna selection","receive antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of per-tone transmit antenna selection in OFDM systems with Alamouti coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639653","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of per-tone transmit antenna selection in OFDM systems with Alamouti coding","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076047S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624488,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","Receivers","MIMO","Frequency diversity","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","computational complexity","diversity reception","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive frequency diversity","MIMO-OFDM systems","group-orthogonal code-division multiplex OFDM","spatial multiplexing","multicarrier multiantenna system","maximum likelihood detector","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a technique to adapt the frequency diversity order in a multicarrier multiantenna system.

Moreover, the proposed strategy guarantees fair services for all users in distinct priority levels. The scheduled users are allocated over the utilized bands in an optimal manner in order to improve the performance of the investigated system. Each user selects a suitable modulation and coding scheme (MCS) based on the corresponding minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The sub-carriers of the transmitted OFDMA frame are grouped in different bands depending on the number of utilized priority levels in a BS. Simulation results show the performance improvement obtained by the proposed strategy over other compared schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624493","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624493.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal user scheduling and allocation for WiMAX OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624493/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal user scheduling and allocation for WiMAX OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639659","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624493/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal user scheduling and allocation for WiMAX OFDMA systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048582S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624495,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We have implement a simulated model of an SVM signal classifier trained to recognize seven distinct modulation schemes; five digital (BPSK, QPSK, GMSK, 16-QAM and 64QAM) and two analog ones (FM and AM). The signals are generated using realistic carrier frequency, sampling frequency and symbol rate values, and pulse-shaping filters types. We also report on our on-going experimental work by using software defined radios (SDR) to implement this as a part of our cognitive radio network testbed. The results show that overall performance of classifier is very good; the trained SVM correctly classifies signals with 85-98% probability in its current state of development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11639662","htmlLink":"/document/5624500/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-class classification of analog and digital signals in cognitive radios using Support Vector Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-class classification of analog and digital signals in cognitive radios using Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052421S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624501,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Li","id":"37539775300"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"},{"name":"Paul D.

The schemes are developed by combining the usage of multichannel CSMA and a reinforcement learning algorithm in a distributed manner. By considering the learning experience from previous transmission, users will only sense or directly access a channel that has a higher success rate. Compared with full sensing, where the scheme senses the entire available spectrum, both schemes maintain a higher throughput performance and sense fewer channels in a low user density scenario. In a high user density scenario, restricted sensing performs equally as well as full sensing. The minimum sensing scheme delivers a slightly lower throughput, but has a significantly reduced sensing requirement compared with the other two schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624501/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11639664","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624501/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio multiple access control for unlicensed and open spectrum with reduced spectrum sensing requirements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio multiple access control for unlicensed and open spectrum with reduced spectrum sensing requirements","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059015S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624504,"authors":[{"name":"L\u00edgia Ma.

Joint Processing (JP) can enhance CoMP systems' performance, mainly employing precoding algorithms based on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Currently, many research efforts focus on reducing feedback and optimizing precoding with partial CSIT. This paper proposes a model to approximate the downlink multiuser CoMP channel based on the channel statistics and taking into account the channel temporal variation. The proposed model is relatively simple, highly reduces feedback overheads, and might be employed to perform precoding. Compared to using linear precoding with instantaneous CSIT, results show that throughput losses are negligible for low SNR values and moderate for high SNR values when using the proposed model. Analyses considering users all over the cell and in the cell-edge are also presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624504.pdf","endPage":"198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser CoMP transmit processing with statistical channel state information at the transmitter","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624504","startPage":"194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser CoMP transmit processing with statistical channel state information at the transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624504/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11639668","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624504/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser CoMP transmit processing with statistical channel state information at the transmitter","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"1603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097003S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624506,"authors":[{"name":"Yigang Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Yigang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37592199800"},{"name":"Fei Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Tian","id":"37589884600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624506","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","covariance matrices","interference suppression","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing algorithm","opportunistic spectrum access","cognitive radio networks","random matrix theory","interference avoidance","quiet period","transmission performance","primary signal","covariance matrix","signal to noise ratio","transmission channel"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spectrum sensing algorithm based on random matrix theory in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","endPage":"975","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624506","startPage":"971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624506","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is the precondition for opportunistic spectrum access.

High Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is an important obstacle to multicarrier communication systems. This paper concentrates on the PAPR investigation and its reduction for LDS-OFDM signals. Specifically, we will investigate the impact of subcarrier allocation schemes and the phases of the signatures on the PAPR of LDS-OFDM signals. Firstly, the PAPR of LDS-OFDM with conventional signatures is investigated. Then we propose two methods for PAPR reduction; Newman phases and DFT pre-coding. The former method is simple and doesn't imply changes in the system structure while the DFT pre-coding implies a modification in the system. Simulation results show that using Newman phases considerably reduces the PAPR of LDS-OFDM. Further PAPR reduction is achieved using DFT pre-coded LDS-OFDM on the cost of higher complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624508.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"926","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Peak to Average Power Ratio of LDS-OFDM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms","Resource management","Multiaccess communication","Complexity theory","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDS-OFDM signals","peak-to-average power ratio","low-density signature orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple access technique","PAPR reduction","multicarrier communication systems","subcarrier allocation","Newman phases","DFT precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDS-OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio","Newman phases","DFT pre-coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Peak to Average Power Ratio of LDS-OFDM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639671","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Peak to Average Power Ratio of LDS-OFDM signals","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"1540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065347S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624509,"authors":[{"name":"Kamran Khan","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany","Communications Laboratory, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Kamran","lastName":"Khan","id":"37605200600"},{"name":"Andreas Ibing","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Chair for Mobile Communications, Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ibing","id":"37304022700"},{"name":"Dirk Dahinaus","affiliation":["Universitat Kassel, Kassel, Hessen, DE"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Dahinaus"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624509","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Synchronization","OFDM","Correlation","Doppler effect","Robustness","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","filtering theory","frequency division multiple access","least mean squares methods","receivers","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine synchronization","adaptive LMMSE channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","uplink OFDMA","parametric tracking","LMMSE filter","delay spread","frequency synchronization errors","coherent receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Wiener filtering","channel tracking","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper parametric tracking of channel and synchronization errors for an adaptive multi-dimensional channel estimator for uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA) communication systems is proposed. The estimator consists of a two-dimensional LMMSE filter. In real world scenarios, channel estimation should work not only in a wide range of terminal velocities and delay spread but it is also confronted with time and frequency synchronization errors affecting the channel estimation and thus limits the performance of both the coherent receiver and overall OFDMA system. We jointly track channel statistics and synchronization errors so that LMMSE filter coefficients closely reflect the current statistics of the channel. Through simulations it is verified that the proposed channel estimator outperforms the robust LMMSE estimator in the presence of synchronization errors and varying channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624509","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"446","endPage":"450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint model for fine synchronization and adaptive LMMSE channel estimation in uplink OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint model for fine synchronization and adaptive LMMSE channel estimation in uplink OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639672","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint model for fine synchronization and adaptive LMMSE channel estimation in uplink OFDMA","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"1547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054671S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624510,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Wu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Wu","id":"37291500200"},{"name":"Yue Fei","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Fei","id":"37597666600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624510","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mathematical programming","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","power allocation","cognitive radio networks","spectrum underlay strategy","primary users","cognitive users","mathematical optimization equation","system capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","channel allocation","power allocation","spectrum sharing","interference temperature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624510","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624510","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","abstract":"This paper investigates the power allocation between channels in a cognitive wireless network, using the spectrum underlay strategy where the primary users (PUs) and the cognitive users (CUs) coexist and operate in the same spectrum.

Previous studies have shown that a proper choice of antenna load impedances can maximise the MIMO capacity or received power in the presence of MC. However, to calculate this optimum load, prior knowledge of the propagation channel matrix and the MC model, which is difficult to measure practically, are required.

The inaccurate clock of femtocells can introduce interference and affect spectrum accuracy. Among the potential methods to solve this problem, wireless network based time synchronization schemes are economical and available in most situations. In wireless networks, receiver-receiver synchronization schemes like RBS offer a very good performance. However, the requirement of one super node and a large number of broadcasts for RBS make it unrealistic to use in some scenarios like a macro/femto scenario. In this paper, a new receiver-receiver synchronization scheme is proposed. It is suitable for macro/femto scenarios and other decentralized networks. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that, while the number of broadcasts in the network is greatly reduced, our proposed scheme has a similar performance in term of synchronization error when compared with RBS.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624513","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624513.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel receiver-receiver time synchronization scheme for femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624513/","displayDocTitle":"A novel receiver-receiver time synchronization scheme for femtocells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639676","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624513/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel receiver-receiver time synchronization scheme for femtocells","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"1510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060007S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624514,"authors":[{"name":"Fengming Cao","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Fengming","lastName":"Cao","id":"37397751100"},{"name":"Zhong Fan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37273608700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624514","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Macrocell networks","Energy efficiency","Throughput","Energy consumption","Niobium","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference suppression","mobility management (mobile radio)","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell deployment","cellular network","LTE system parameters","interference mitigation","power control","mobility management","resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","energy efficiency","interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of deploying femtocells in a cellular network.

As the number of sources is much smaller than the number of potential source positions, sparse signal representation can be adopted. In this paper, we propose a new sparsity based matched field (MF) processing method to solve the underwater source localization problem. The proposed method is based on solving the basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) problem for multi-frequency signals. An efficient algorithm based on homotopy approach and coordinate descent optimization is used to find the BPDN solution. The performance is evaluated by applying this technique to real data obtained in the underwater acoustic experiment SWellEx-96. It is shown that this method can accurately locate multiple sources. It outperforms other MF approaches in resolving sources positioned very closely to each other, tolerance to noise and capability of locating multiple sources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624519","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband underwater source localization by solving basis pursuit de-noising using coordinate descent search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Broadband underwater source localization by solving basis pursuit de-noising using coordinate descent search","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639682","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband underwater source localization by solving basis pursuit de-noising using coordinate descent search","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"1281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044296S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5624527,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The stability of the GF (q) LDPC decoder with higher order modulation schemes is examined on both additive-white-Gaussian-noise (AWGN) and block Rayleigh fading channels and threshold stability conditions under iterative decoding are obtained using density evolution techniques. It is shown that both on block Rayleigh fading channel when the ideal channel state information (CSI) of the fading process is known, and on AWGN channel, the stability condition of the underlying code is bounded by the Bhattacharya noise parameter. We show that the derived stability condition is both sufficient and necessary condition for iterative belief propagation decoding assuming cycle free massage passing between variable and check nodes.

Based on aggressive sharing method, we quantify these goals by analyzing (i) a joint power control and interference cancellation to guarantee the performance in primary system; (ii) a cross-layer and dual problem method to transform MAC-layer QoS requirements to PHY-layer; (iii) the convex optimization to solve the problem of the system. The joint cross-layer solution is effectively achieved.

The BER performance of an ASTC-MIMO-OFDM system, under several propagation conditions, have been evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624539","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"159","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of Golden Codes with a correlated Rayleigh frequency-selective channel in OFDM system with imperfect channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of Golden Codes with a correlated Rayleigh frequency-selective channel in OFDM system with imperfect channel estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624539/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639802","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624539/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of Golden Codes with a correlated Rayleigh frequency-selective channel in OFDM system with imperfect channel estimation","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0479S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624540,"authors":[{"name":"Mouncef Benmimoune","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, Trois-Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mouncef","lastName":"Benmimoune","id":"37594954200"},{"name":"Daniel Massicotte","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, Trois-Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Massicotte","id":"37284131800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624540","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","computational complexity","jamming","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Grassmannian precoding","multiuser MIMO system","maximal SJNR criterion","maximal signal-to-jamming-and noise ratio criterion","Grassmannian codebook design","multiuser MIMO broadcast channel","channel information","base station","computational complexity","computer simulations","maximal system capacity criterion"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, our purpose is to use the maximal signal-to-jamming-and noise ratio (SJNR) criterion to design a Grassmannian codebook for a precoding scheme in a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel.

Since the complexity of the ML and the existing near ML algorithms such as the sphere decoder (SD) is still high in systems with bad channel conditions and/or low signal-noise ratio (SNR), there is a need for flexible and cost effective MIMO detectors. In the proposed multiple feedback successive interference cancellation with shadow area constraints (MF-SIC-SAC) algorithm, feedback diversity (FD) is introduced to combat the error propagation effect in decision feedback systems and achieve a close to ML performance. For our scheme, the computational complexity is as low as the SIC algorithm with very low additional complexity added. Simulation results show that the proposed detection significantly outperforms the conventional SIC scheme while maintaining a low detection complexity. The SNR has about 0.5dB degradation at the target bit error rate BER = 0.001 compared with the MLD with QPSK modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless

employed to perform signal precoding in multiuser downlink communications. Efficient implementations of this method have been well investigated, which, as the original algorithm, provide a matrix that contains the transformations to be done over the initial channel matrix in order to get a transformed matrix with less correlated columns. Since there are several precoding algorithms that also make use of the inverse of the channel transformation matrix, in this work we use an efficient way to calculate the inverse of the transformation matrix inside the LLL algorithm. The impact of the preprocessing computational cost reduction in the overall cost of some well-known precoding algorithms is also discussed. In addition, both a computational cost and a performance comparison among the algorithms is included.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624548","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624548.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"299","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of precoding techniques for multiuser communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of precoding techniques for multiuser communication systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624548/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639806","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624548/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of precoding techniques for multiuser communication systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048375S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624549,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Ben Ghorbel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Ben Ghorbel","id":"37595076800"},{"name":"Haewoon Nam","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Haewoon","lastName":"Nam","id":"37410378600"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6317-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6315-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6316-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"5624549","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Base stations","Interference constraints","Cognitive radio","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized location-based resource allocation","OFDMA cognitive radio systems","wireless communication","primary users","cognitive user","channel state information","location information","pathloss computation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","relative location information","multiple primary users","optimal exhaustive search method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radios","resource allocation","location information","pathloss estimation"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is one of the hot topics for emerging and future wireless communication. Cognitive users can share channels with primary users under the condition of non interference. In order to compute this interference, the cognitive system usually use the channel state information of the primary user which is often impractical to obtain. However, using location information, we can estimate this interference by pathloss computation. In this paper, we introduce a low-complexity resource allocation algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based cognitive radio systems, which uses relative location information between primary and secondary users to estimate the interference. This algorithm considers interference with multiple primary users having different thresholds. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with an optimal exhaustive search method.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624549","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610913/5624250/05624549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624250","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized location-based resource allocation for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized location-based resource allocation for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624549/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639810","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624549/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized location-based resource allocation for OFDMA cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063319S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610913","isNumber":"5624250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610913","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5624250","articleId":"5624549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624552,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Terabit superchannels are obtained through the aggregation of multiple subcarriers using the Nyquist-WDM technique, based on a tight spectral shaping of each subcarrier which allows very narrow spacing. We first studied the optimum transmitter/receiver filtering in a back-to-back configuration. Then we investigated the maximum reach for different spectral efficiencies, after nonlinear propagation over uncompensated links with lumped amplification. Performance for systems based on both standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) and large effective area non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber (NZDSF) has been analyzed. Assuming SSMF with 25-dB span loss, we found that PM-BPSK can reach 6480 km at a net capacity of 4 Tb/s across the C band. Conversely, PM-16QAM can deliver 27 Tb/s, but over 270 km only. Note that a lower span length, the use of Raman amplification and/or pure silica-core fibers (PSCFs) can significantly increase the maximum reach, but without changing the hierarchy among the performance of modulation formats. We also show that the maximum reachable distance is approximately 2/3 of the one achievable in linear propagation at the optimum launch power, regardless of the modulation format, spacing and fiber type. As additional results, we also verified that the optimum launch power per subcarrier linearly depends on the span loss, varies with the fiber type, but it is independent of the modulation format, and that the relationship between the maximum reachable distance and the span loss is almost linear.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2091254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2091254","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5672498/05624553.pdf","startPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Nyquist-WDM Terabit Superchannels Based on PM-BPSK, PM-QPSK, PM-8QAM or PM-16QAM Subcarriers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624553/","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Nyquist-WDM Terabit Superchannels Based on PM-BPSK, PM-QPSK, PM-8QAM or PM-16QAM Subcarriers","volume":"29","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11728027","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624553/","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Nyquist-WDM Terabit Superchannels Based on PM-BPSK, PM-QPSK, PM-8QAM or PM-16QAM Subcarriers","sourcePdf":"jlt-bosco-2091254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106004S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5672498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"368","xplore-issue":"5672498","articleId":"5624553","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5624558,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The feasibility and advantages of mini-UAV-borne LIDAR have been demonstrated by the promising results based on the real-measured data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5753305/05624563.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2010.2079913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2079913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mini-UAV-Borne LIDAR for Fine-Scale Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Roads","Remote sensing","Laser modes","Atmospheric modeling","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","helicopters","optical radar","remotely operated vehicles","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mini-UAV-borne LIDAR","fine-scale mapping","light detection","ranging systems","unmanned aerial vehicles","mini-UAV-borne laser scanning","Align T-Rex 600E helicopter","data processing","tree height estimation","pole detection","road extraction","digital terrain model refinement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fine scale","light detection and ranging (LIDAR)","mapping","mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mini-UAV-Borne LIDAR for Fine-Scale Mapping","volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5624563/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11961155","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mini-UAV-Borne LIDAR for Fine-Scale Mapping","sourcePdf":"lgrs-lin-2079913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071085S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5753305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"5753305","articleId":"5624563","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5624564,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Indeed, soil moisture is an important piece of information to improve fluid flow modeling or to better understand the water uptake by plant roots. In this letter, we address the problem of recovering the footprint of soil moisture evolution with respect to time using a built-in laboratory microwave setup coupled to a robust qualitative microwave imaging method: the linear sampling method (LSM). The evolution of the water content in the soil is ruled by the Richards equations and stored at different time steps. The associated maps of soil water content are converted into permittivity maps using the Dobson model. Electromagnetic scattered fields are then computed with finite-element software. We have tested the LSM in a situation that can be encountered in agricultural soils where the water content is not homogeneous. We show that the evolution of the soil water content can be qualitatively monitored with the LSM. We also point out that the source is more precisely located by considering the evolution in time of the singular system of the multistatic matrix (multiple signal classification method).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil","Permittivity","Water resources","Multiple signal classification","Mathematical model","Microwave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","diffusion","finite element analysis","geophysical signal processing","hydrological techniques","microwave imaging","moisture","permittivity","signal classification","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soil water diffusion microwave imaging","linear sampling method","soil column volumetric water content monitoring","noninvasive microwave imaging system","fluid flow modeling","plant root water uptake","soil moisture evolution footprint","qualitative microwave imaging method","LSM","Richards equations","permittivity maps","Dobson model","electromagnetic scattered fields","finite element software","agricultural soils","inhomogeneous water content","multistatic matrix","multiple signal classification method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","inverse problems","linear sampling method (LSM)","multiple signal classification (MUSIC)","soil moisture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2010.2082490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5753305/05624564.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2082490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Imaging of Soil Water Diffusion Using the Linear Sampling Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Imaging of Soil Water Diffusion Using the Linear Sampling Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624564/","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624564/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11961156","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Imaging of Soil Water Diffusion Using the Linear Sampling Method","sourcePdf":"lgrs-tortel-2082490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064474S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5753305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5753305","articleId":"5624564","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5624570,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Lobel","affiliation":["Information, Operations and Management Sciences Department, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5784391/5624570/5624570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ilan Lobel received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pontificia Universidade Catolica of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2009.","In 2010, he joined the New York University's (NYU) Stern School of Business, where he is an Assistant Professor of information, operations, and management sciences.

We assume that each agent has information about his local function, and communicate with the other agents over a time-varying network topology. For this problem, we propose a distributed subgradient method that uses averaging algorithms for locally sharing information among the agents. In contrast to previous works on multi-agent optimization that make worst-case assumptions about the connectivity of the agents (such as bounded communication intervals between nodes), we assume that links fail according to a given stochastic process. Under the assumption that the link failures are independent and identically distributed over time (possibly correlated across links), we provide almost sure convergence results for our subgradient algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5784391/05624570.pdf","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2091295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2091295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Subgradient Methods for Convex Optimization Over Random Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Optimization","Availability","Convex functions","Markov processes","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","gradient methods","graph theory","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed subgradient methods","convex optimization","random networks","convex functions","time-varying network topology","averaging algorithms","multi-agent optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Subgradient Methods for Convex Optimization Over Random Networks","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5624570/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047068","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Subgradient Methods for Convex Optimization Over Random Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-lobel-2091295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078737S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5784391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"5784391","articleId":"5624570","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5624571,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Touri","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5937467/5624571/5624571-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behrouz Touri (s'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in communications, systems, and electronics from Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany, in 2008, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in industrial and enterprise systems engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign.","His research interests include random dynamics, decentralized optimization, control and estimation, coding theory, and optimization theory.","Mr. Touri is a member of the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society."]},"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Touri","id":"38193901000"},{"name":"Angelia Nedic","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5937467/5624571/5624571-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Angelia Nedi\u0107 (M'06) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro, in 1987, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 1990, the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and mathematical physics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2002.","She was with BAE Systems Advanced Information Technology from 2002 to 2006.

The central result is the infinite flow theorem establishing the equivalence between the infinite flow and the ergodicity for a class of independent random models, where the matrices in the model have a common steady state in expectation and a feedback property. For such models, this result demonstrates that the expected infinite flow is both necessary and sufficient for the ergodicity.

This result shows that the proposed bearingless brushless dc motor is suitable as the drive for small liquid pumps.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2091233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2091233","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5688725/05624584.pdf","startPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Suspension Performance of a Bearingless Brushless DC Motor for Small Liquid Pumps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624584/","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Suspension Performance of a Bearingless Brushless DC Motor for Small Liquid Pumps","volume":"47","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11759917","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5624584/","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Suspension Performance of a Bearingless Brushless DC Motor for Small Liquid Pumps","sourcePdf":"tia-ooshima-2091233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061316S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5688725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5688725","articleId":"5624584","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5624588,"authors":[{"name":"Wei L.

These functionalities enable the development of wireless ECG monitoring systems that have significantly lower power consumption yet that are more capable than their predecessors. The ASP has been implemented in 0.5 \u03bcm CMOS process and consumes 30 \u03bcW from a 2 V supply. The noise density of the ECG readout channel is 85 nV/\u221aHz and the CMRR is better that 105 dB. The adaptive sampling ADC is capable of compressing the ECG data by a factor of 7 and the heterodyne chopper readout extracts the features of the ECG signals. Combination of these two features leads to a factor 4 reduction in the power consumption of a wireless ECG monitoring system. Furthermore, the proposed continuous-time impedance monitoring circuit enables the monitoring of the signal integrity.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2085930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2085930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5673672/05624590.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 30 -W Analog Signal Processor ASIC for Portable Biopotential Signal Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 30 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W Analog Signal Processor ASIC for Portable Biopotential Signal Monitoring","volume":"46","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624590/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704565","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624590/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 30 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W Analog Signal Processor ASIC for Portable Biopotential Signal Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jssc-yazicioglu-2085930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5624590","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624596,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Racetrack superconducting coils made from YBCO coated conductors have been used in several engineering applications including SMES, rotor or stator windings of electric machines. AC loss is one of the most important factors that determine the design and performance of superconducting devices. In this paper, a numerical model is developed to calculate the AC losses in superconducting racetrack coils in different magnetic conditions. This paper first discusses the AC losses of the coils in self-field or external field only. It then goes to investigate the AC losses of the coils being exposed to AC ripple field and a DC background field. Finally, the AC losses of the coils carrying DC current and being exposed to AC field are calculated. These two scenarios correspond to using superconducting coils as the rotor field winding of an electric machine.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5776774/05624596.pdf","startPage":"2466","endPage":"2469","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2010.2084065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2010.2084065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5776774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC Losses of Superconducting Racetrack Coil in Various Magnetic Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"AC Losses of Superconducting Racetrack Coil in Various Magnetic Conditions","htmlLink":"/document/5624596/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12022500","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC Losses of Superconducting Racetrack Coil in Various Magnetic Conditions","sourcePdf":"tasc-hong-2084065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051091S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5776774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5776774","articleId":"5624596","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624612,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the profit-seeking nature of the ISPs leads to selfish behaviors that result in inefficiencies and disputes in the network. This concern is at the heart of the \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d debate, which also asks for an appropriate compensation structure that satisfies all types of ISPs. Our previous work showed in a general network model that the Shapley value has several desirable properties, and that if applied as the profit model, selfish ISPs would yield globally optimal routing and interconnecting decisions. In this paper, we use a more detailed and realistic network model with three classes of ISPs: content, transit, and eyeball. This additional detail enables us to delve much deeper into the implications of a Shapley settlement mechanism. We derive closed-form Shapley values for more structured ISP topologies and develop a dynamic programming procedure to compute the Shapley values under more diverse Internet topologies. We also identify the implications on the bilateral compensation between ISPs and the pricing structures for differentiated services. In practice, these results provide guidelines for solving disputes between ISPs and for establishing regulatory protocols for differentiated services and the industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5875977/05624625.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"815","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2089533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2089533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Cooperative Settlement Between Content, Transit, and Eyeball Internet Service Providers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Biological system modeling","Topology","Aggregates","Web and internet services","Pricing","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","dynamic programming","Internet","routing protocols","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative settlement","Internet service providers","eyeball","global network services","ISP","Shapley value","optimal routing","network topology","dynamic programming","bilateral compensation","protocols","network neutrality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coalition games","Internet service provider (ISP) settlement","network economics","network neutrality","Shapley value"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"On Cooperative Settlement Between Content, Transit, and Eyeball Internet Service Providers","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5624625/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12060292","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Cooperative Settlement Between Content, Transit, and Eyeball Internet Service Providers","sourcePdf":"tnet-ma-2089533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134422S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5875977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5875977","articleId":"5624625","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5624630,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5624630/5624630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Huang was born in 1975.

To address this problem, we present a super-resolution method that uses nonlinear mappings to infer coherent features that favor higher recognition of the nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers for recognition of single LR face image. Canonical correlation analysis is applied to establish the coherent subspaces between the principal component analysis (PCA) based features of high-resolution (HR) and LR face images. Then, a nonlinear mapping between HR/LR features can be built by radial basis functions (RBFs) with lower regression errors in the coherent feature space than in the PCA feature space. Thus, we can compute super-resolved coherent features corresponding to an input LR image according to the trained RBF model efficiently and accurately. And, face identity can be obtained by feeding these super-resolved features to a simple NN classifier. Extensive experiments on the Facial Recognition Technology, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and Olivetti Research Laboratory databases show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms for single LR image in terms of both recognition rate and robustness to facial variations of pose and expression.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-Resolution Method for Face Recognition Using Nonlinear Mappings on Coherent Features","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2089470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5680555/05624630.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2089470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Super-Resolution Method for Face Recognition Using Nonlinear Mappings on Coherent Features","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5624630/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742258","pubMedId":"21062679","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Resolution Method for Face Recognition Using Nonlinear Mappings on Coherent Features","sourcePdf":"tnn-huang-2089470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140964S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5680555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5680555","articleId":"5624630","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5624633,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

Clinically, there is interest in identifying potential associations between lesion texture and disease progression, and in relating texture features with relevant clinical indexes, such as the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). This longitudinal study explores the application of 2-D AM-FM analysis of brain white matter MS lesions to quantify and monitor disease load. To this end, MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) from MS patients, as well as normal white matter (NWM) from healthy volunteers, were segmented on transverse T2-weighted images obtained from serial brain MR imaging (MRI) scans (0 and 6-12 months). The instantaneous amplitude (IA), the magnitude of the instantaneous frequency (IF), and the IF angle were extracted from each segmented region at different scales. The findings suggest that AM-FM characteristics succeed in differentiating 1) between NWM and lesions; 2) between NAWM and lesions; and 3) between NWM and NAWM. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier succeeded in differentiating between patients that, two years after the initial MRI scan, acquired an EDSS \u2264 2 from those with EDSS >; 2 (correct classification rate = 86%). The best classification results were obtained from including the combination of the low-scale IA and IF magnitude with the medium-scale IA. The AM-FM features provide complementary information to classical texture analysis features like the gray-scale median, contrast, and coarseness. The findings of this study provide evidence that AM-FM features may have a potential role as surrogate markers of lesion load in MS.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Magnetic

Conventional PLL schemes have to compromise between steady-state accuracy and transient dynamics when grid voltage is polluted by unbalance and harmonics. To overcome this challenge, a generalized delayed-signal-cancellation (DSC) operator is proposed recently to form cascaded DSC (CDSC) operator to eliminate arbitrary harmonics. With the CDSC operator, the conditioned voltage can be used in PLL loop with very high bandwidth for fast tracking. However, for digital implementation, the CDSC operator may subject to delay-time error, which subsequently leads to residual distortions in the conditioned voltage. In this paper, a thorough analysis of the CDSC operator in both synchronous and stationary reference frames is first conducted. The discretization error during digital implementation due to nonideal system sampling frequency and/or grid-frequency variation is quantified with the proposed concept of relative harmonic gain error. An effective improvement method is then developed that is based on linear interpolation and is effective for all delay-based PLL schemes. Finally, experimental results are obtained to verify the harmonic elimination ability of CDSC in various scenarios and the effectiveness of the interpolation-based digital implementation scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5871429/05624643.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2091150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2091150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Digital Implementation of Cascaded Delayed-Signal-Cancellation PLL","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Phase locked loops","Delay","Time domain analysis","Time frequency analysis","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convertors","phase locked loops","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital implementation","cascaded delayed signal cancellation","PLL","phase locked loop","grid phase angle","grid-tied converters","arbitrary harmonics","discretization error","nonideal system sampling frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delayed signal cancellation (DSC)","discretization error","grid synchronization","phase-locked loop (PLL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Digital Implementation of Cascaded Delayed-Signal-Cancellation PLL","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5624643/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047691","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Digital Implementation of Cascaded Delayed-Signal-Cancellation PLL","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2091150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119513S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5871429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5871429","articleId":"5624643","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5624644,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5767815/5624644/5624644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Wang (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the M.Sc. degree in power electronics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2010.","From April 2005 to December 2006, he was with Philips Lighting Electronics Global Development Center, Shanghai, China.

The root cause of harmonic interaction/resonance problems is the impedance-network quasi-resonance between the effective output impedance of the inverter and the equivalent grid impedance at the connection point. Starting with the output impedance modeling of an inverter, a Norton model of the inverter is derived. Comparing with the switching model and the average model of the inverter, simulation results show the effectiveness of the model. This paper proposes that impedance limits should be specified and used as an extra design constraint for DG inverters in order to minimize the harmonic distortion impact on the grid. Assuming the impedance models of individual inverters and local loads within a distribution grid are known, especially in the case of new grids under construction, harmonic interactions between the grid and a certain number of DG inverters can be preliminarily estimated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05624644.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2091286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2091286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Grid Harmonic Distortion Impact of Aggregated DG Inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Integrated circuit modeling","Harmonic distortion","Analytical models","Power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","harmonic distortion","invertors","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid harmonic distortion impact","impedance-based analytical method","aggregated distributed generation inverter","harmonic interaction-resonance problem","impedance-network quasiresonance","equivalent grid impedance","Norton model","switching inverter","distribution grid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation (DG)","distortion","harmonic interactions","inverters","modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Grid Harmonic Distortion Impact of Aggregated DG Inverters","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5624644/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004907","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Grid Harmonic Distortion Impact of Aggregated DG Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2091286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073078S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5624644","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5624648,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Singh Rawat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"p":["Ankit Singh Rawat, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ankit Singh","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37408390800"},{"name":"Priyank Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"p":["Priyank Anand, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Priyank","lastName":"Anand","id":"37408889900"},{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hao Chen (S'06\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, in 2007.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate and Research Assistant Professor at Syracuse University, between May 2007 and October 2008 and between November 2008 and July 2010, respectively.

Collaborative (or distributed) spectrum sensing has been shown to have various advantages in terms of spectrum utilization and robustness. The data fusion scheme is a key component of collaborative spectrum sensing. In this paper, we analyze the performance limits of collaborative spectrum sensing under Byzantine Attacks where malicious users send false sensing data to the fusion center leading to increased probability of incorrect sensing results. We show that above a certain fraction of Byzantine attackers in the CR network, data fusion scheme becomes completely incapable and no reputation based fusion scheme can achieve any performance gain. We present optimal attacking strategies for given attacking resources and also analyze the possible counter measures at the fusion center (FC). Based on these analyses, we also propose a novel and easy to implement technique to counter Byzantine attacks in CRNs. In this approach, the FC identifies the attackers and removes them from the data fusion process. Our analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is robust against Byzantine attacks and can successfully remove the Byzantines in a short time span.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","volume":"59","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11742852","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624648/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Byzantine Attacks in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Byzantine Attacks in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2091277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094063S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5624648","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624649,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5685344/5624649/5624649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo C. de Lamare (S'99\u2013M'04\u2013SM'10) received the Diploma degree in electronic engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil, in 1998 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Since January 2006, he has been with the Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, U.K., where he is currently a Lecturer in communications engineering.

The proposed scheme and algorithms are based on a two-stage processing framework that consists of a transformation matrix that performs dimensionality reduction followed by a reduced-rank estimator. The complex structure of the transformation matrix of existing methods motivates the development of a blind adaptive reduced-rank constrained (BARC) scheme along with a low-complexity reduced-rank decomposition. The proposed BARC scheme and a reduced-rank decomposition based on the concept of joint interpolation, switched decimation and reduced-rank estimation subject to a set of constraints are then detailed. The proposed set of constraints ensures that the multipath components of the channel are combined prior to dimensionality reduction. We develop low-complexity joint interpolation and decimation techniques, stochastic gradient, and recursive least squares reduced-rank estimation algorithms. A model-order selection algorithm for adjusting the length of the estimators is devised along with techniques for determining the required number of switching branches to attain a predefined performance. An analysis of the convergence properties and issues of the proposed optimization and algorithms is carried out, and the key features of the optimization problem are discussed. We consider the application of the proposed algorithms to interference suppression in DS-CDMA systems.

Based on this technique, an antenna selection method in beamspace is developed for MIMO systems using compact uniform circular arrays (UCAs) at the receiver. To take advantages of the FFT-based antenna selection scheme for application in practical scenarios, a parametric physical model that considers the geometrical properties of the scattering environment is introduced to include realistic fading conditions into the channel matrix. Furthermore, due to the limited spatial phase modes of UCAs, the channel matrix resulting from the beamspace preprocessing only possesses a limited and small number of nonzero rows. This substantially reduces the computational load in the following beam selection procedure. More importantly, the optimal beam selection can be realized even without channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. This characteristic is especially useful for compact UCAs with a large number of elements. Besides, it is also found that the severe mutual coupling effect resulting from compact UCAs does not affect these favorable characteristics of the FFT-based preprocessing technique. Numerical examples considering strong mutual coupling in compact UCAs are provided to verify and validate the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on the FFT-Based Antenna Selection for Compact Uniform Circular Arrays in Correlated MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2091275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05624650.pdf","startPage":"739","endPage":"746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2091275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on the FFT-Based Antenna Selection for Compact Uniform Circular Arrays in Correlated MIMO Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5624650/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742853","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on the FFT-Based Antenna Selection for Compact Uniform Circular Arrays in Correlated MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-hui-2091275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095598S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5624650","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5624681,"authors":[{"name":"Jason D.

This paper proposes to exploit the lossless compressibility of files in LDPC coded NAND flash memories to reduce such latency overhead, other than saving storage space as in conventional practice. The key idea is to apply run-time lossless data compression to enable an opportunistic use of a stronger LDPC code with more coding redundancy, and trade such opportunistic extra error correction capability to allow more coarser-grained memory sensing and hence lead to less read response speed overhead without sacrificing the overall performance. Since the basic operation of NAND flash is typically realized in the unit of page (e.g., 4KB user data per page in the current NAND flash), we only apply this strategy to each individual page independently in order to be completely transparent to the firmware, operating systems and users. This paper quantitatively studies the effectiveness of this design strategy in 2bits/cell NAND flash memories. Results in the case study show that with this design strategy, up to 95.24% on-chip memory sensing latency reduction and 66.67% flash-to-controller data transfer latency can be achieved respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624760/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11637802","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624760/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying transparent lossless data compression to improve the feasibility of using advanced error correction codes in solid-state drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying transparent lossless data compression to improve the feasibility of using advanced error correction codes in solid-state drives","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101485S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5624763,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The 2-beam FPGA-based example operates at a clock frequency of 40 MHz, implying a real-time frame-rate of 40 Million frames per second. FPGA prototypes are the first step towards eventualy custom silicon VLSI realizations operating at the full RF clock frequency of 800-3000 MHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624763/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11637806","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624763/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-prototypes of differential-form 2D-IIR systolic-array DSP architectures for multi-beam plane-wave filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-prototypes of differential-form 2D-IIR systolic-array DSP architectures for multi-beam plane-wave filters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04209S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624764,"authors":[{"name":"Manohar Ayinala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Manohar","lastName":"Ayinala","id":"37589801800"},{"name":"Keshab K.

In this paper, a novel check node processing scheme and corresponding VLSI architectures are proposed for the Min-max NB-LDPC decoding.

Finite precision analysis demonstrates that the use of the BER-optimal ADC does not increase the equalizer complexity/power significantly. An adaptive algorithm referred to as the approximate minimum BER algorithm (AMBER) is proposed in order to determine the BER-optimal reference levels. Finite-precision analysis of AMBER indicates that reference levels represented with 9-bit precision is sufficient for a 3-bit BER-optimal ADC to achieve BER equal to that of a 4-bit conventional ADC. An architectural implementation of AMBER is also presented. The reference-level adaptation unit (RL-UD) has a full-adder (FA) complexity that is 76% over the conventional adaptive equalizer. The RL-UD block is clock-gated after convergence and hence does not present a power overhead. Thus, for high-speed links employing the flash ADC architecture, the proposed AMBER receiver represents a power savings of approximately 50% in the ADC.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624766","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624766.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER-based adaptive ADC-equalizer based receiver for communication links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"BER-based adaptive ADC-equalizer based receiver for communication links","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637805","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624766/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER-based adaptive ADC-equalizer based receiver for communication links","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057609S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5624770,"authors":[{"name":"Juergen Wassner","affiliation":["Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Wassner","id":"37596076900"},{"name":"Klaus Zahn","affiliation":["Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Zahn","id":"37589742000"},{"name":"Ulrich Dersch","affiliation":["Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Dersch","id":"37602879000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624770","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Pixel","Central Processing Unit","Field programmable gate arrays","Arrays","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","scheduling","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign","tightly-coupled coprocessor","video content analysis","hardware acceleration","Virtex-5 FPGA","PowerPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video signal processing","Coprocessor","Hardware acceleration","Field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"Hardware acceleration is a popular method to boost performance in video processing applications.

This paper presents the Bounded Block Parallel Lattice Reduction (BBP-LR) algorithm, which is an implementation friendly low complexity algorithm specifically optimized for practical MIMO-OFDM systems. The optimisation of the BBP-LR algorithm is based on the following: 1) exploiting the frequency coherence in MIMO-OFDM to enable parallel processing that suits SIMD/vector architectures; 2) bounding the execution behaviour to reduce complexity and enable hard real-time task scheduling; 3) performing a frame based preprocessing to significantly reduce complexity. The proposed BBP-LR algorithm has been evaluated in the context of LTE MIMO receivers. When comparing to linear MIMO detectors, the proposed algorithm brings performance improvement at a small complexity increase. Specifically, when compared to ZF, BBP-LR based preprocessing brings an impressive 11dB SNR gain at the cost of only 23% complexity increase.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624784","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624784.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded Block Parallel Lattice Reduction algorithm for MIMO-OFDM and its application in LTE MIMO receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624784/","displayDocTitle":"Bounded Block Parallel Lattice Reduction algorithm for MIMO-OFDM and its application in LTE MIMO receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637827","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624784/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded Block Parallel Lattice Reduction algorithm for MIMO-OFDM and its application in LTE MIMO receiver","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083154S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624785,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis Lagunas Morales","affiliation":["LRTS, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Canada"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Luis Lagunas","lastName":"Morales","id":"37590355100"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Roy","affiliation":["LRTS, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Canada"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274779000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624785","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Chaotic communication","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Modulation","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","chaotic communication","diversity reception","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","signal detection","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood detection","chaotic underdetermined MIMO systems","spatial diversity","chaos shift keying transceiver","chaos based modulated signals","multiple antennas","high spectral efficency","multiple input multiple output system","bit error rate","chaotic communication","Rayleigh channel","virtual MIMO systems","ML chaotic detector","CSI","joint channel estimation","signal detection method","signal subspace analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","channel estimation","Chaotic communications","joint detetection","Virtual MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a technique that provides spatial diversity for a Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) transceiver.

The challenge of implementing a turbo decoder is finding an efficient mapping of the decoder algorithm on GPU, e.g. finding a good way to parallelize workload across cores and allocate and use fast on-die memory to improve throughput. In our implementation, we increase throughput through 1) distributing the decoding workload for a codeword across multiple cores, 2) decoding multiple codewords simultaneously to increase concurrency and 3) employing memory optimization techniques to reduce memory bandwidth requirements. In addition, we analyze how different MAP algorithm approximations affect both throughput and bit error rate (BER) performance of this decoder.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624788","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a 3GPP LTE turbo decoder accelerator on GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a 3GPP LTE turbo decoder accelerator on GPU","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624788/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637830","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a 3GPP LTE turbo decoder accelerator on GPU","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063306S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624790,"authors":[{"name":"Zaipeng Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Zaipeng","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288757300"},{"name":"Michael Schulte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","Research and Advanced Development Laboratories, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schulte","id":"37273849400"},{"name":"Craig Deibele","affiliation":["Research Accelerator Division, Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Deibele","id":"37589810200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624790","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Damping","Field programmable gate arrays","Power harmonic filters","Particle beams","Throughput","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","field programmable gate arrays","neutron beams","neutron sources","particle beam stability","proton accelerators","proton beams","signal processing equipment","storage rings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based active feedback damping system","spallation neutron source","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","high-intensity proton-based accelerator","neutron beams","neutron-scattering research","pulsed neutron source","beam instability","signal processing system","wideband instabilities","high-intensity proton beams","analog-to-digital converter","digital-to-analog converter","signal processing performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","real time systems","FIR digital filters","parallel architectures","particle beam stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624790","abstract":"The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a high-intensity proton-based accelerator that produces neutron beams for neutron-scattering research. As the most powerful pulsed neutron source in the world, the SNS accelerator has experienced an unprecedented beam instability that has a wide bandwidth (0 to 300 MHz) and fast growth time (10 to 100 \u03bcs). In this paper, we propose and analyze several FPGA-based designs for an active feedback damping system. This signal processing system is the first FPGA-based design for active feedback damping of wideband instabilities in high-intensity accelerators. It can effectively mitigate instabilities in high-intensity protons beams, reduce radiation, and boost the accelerator's luminosity performance. Unlike existing systems, which are designed using analog components, our FPGA-based active feedback damping system offers programmability while maintaining high performance. To meet the system throughput and latency requirements, we proposed these designs based on detailed analysis of resource and performance tradeoffs.

Using Compressed Sensing, that data can be reconstructed with a high probability from a small collection of random linear combinations of those measurements. This opens a new approach to simultaneously extract, transmit and distribute information in wireless sensor networks. Efficient communication schemes well matched to compressive sensing are, nonetheless, needed to realize the full benefits of this approach. We present a simple, practical scheme, called NetCompress, using a novel form of Network Coding. It preserves the reconstruction conditions required for Compressed Sensing and also overcomes the high link-failure rate in wireless sensor networks. NetCompress simultaneously transmits packets of sensor measurements and encodes them to form random projections for Compressed Sensing recovery. A recent result in Compressed Sensing guarantees that the data at all nodes can be accurately recovered with a high probability from a small number of projections, which is much less than the total number of nodes in the network. NetCompress demonstrates this result on both the TOSSIM simulation platform and a testbed comprising 20 micaz and tmote sensor nodes. Our experimental results show that the number of packets that is needed to reconstruct light intensity measurements with reasonable quality is just half the number of nodes in the network.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624815","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624815.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Netcompress: Coupling network coding and compressed sensing for efficient data communication in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624815/","displayDocTitle":"Netcompress: Coupling network coding and compressed sensing for efficient data communication in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637858","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624815/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Netcompress: Coupling network coding and compressed sensing for efficient data communication in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063551S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5624816,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Marchand","affiliation":["Lab-STICC CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France","NXP Semiconductors, Caen, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Marchand","id":"37408122500"},{"name":"Laura Conde-Canencia","affiliation":["Lab-STICC CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Conde-Canencia","id":"38272782600"},{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["Lab-STICC CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Boutillon","id":"37281706400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624816","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Random access memory","Digital video broadcasting","Parity check codes","Equations","Standards","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital video broadcasting","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite precision optimization","layered LDPC decoders","quantization bits","message saturation","memory size optimization","DVB-S2 decoder","memory area"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) code","layered decoding","VLSI implementation","DVB-S2"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624816","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624816.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624816","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and finite precision optimization for layered LDPC decoders","abstract":"Layered decoding is known to provide efficient and high-throughput implementation of LDPC decoders.

To be specific, in the DVB-S2,-T2 and -C2 standards, the memory can occupy up to 70% of the total area. In this paper, we focus our attention on the optimization of the number of quantization bits. Message saturation and memory size optimization are considered for the case of a DVB-S2 decoder. We show that the memory area can be reduced by 28% compared to the state-of-the-art, without performance loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624816/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11637859","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5624816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and finite precision optimization for layered LDPC decoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and finite precision optimization for layered LDPC decoders","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075949S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624875,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Do Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Do","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185808600"},{"name":"Myung Hoon Sunwoo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung Hoon","lastName":"Sunwoo","id":"37271838300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624875","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Polynomials","Decoding","Microprocessors","Clocks","Complexity theory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error analysis","optical communication","polynomials","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-DCME algorithm","optical communication","high speed area efficient four channel three parallel Reed-Solomon decoder","simplified degree computationless modified Euclid algorithm","key equation solver block","error locator","error value polynomials","hardware complexity","KES block","syndrome computation","chien search and error evaluation blocks","16 channel three parallel RS architectures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RS decoder","Three-parallel","S-DCME"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a high-speed and area-efficient three-parallel Reed-Solomon (RS) decoder using the simplified degree computationless modified Euclid (S-DCME) algorithm for the key equation solver (KES) block. To achieve high throughput rate, the inner signals such as syndrome, error locator and error value polynomials are computed in parallel. In addition, key equations are solved by using the S-DCME algorithm to reduce hardware complexity. The proposed RS architecture can reduce about 60% of hardware complexity respect to the KES block. By adopting the S-DCME algorithm to implement the KES block, the other blocks, such as the syndrome computation (SC), chien search and error evaluation (CSEE) blocks of an entire RS decoder are optimized. As a result, the proposed RS architecture has approximately 34% lower hardware complexity and 25% shorter latency compared with conventional 16 channel three-parallel RS architectures.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624875","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624875.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four channel three-parallel Reed-Solomon decoder using S-DCME algorithm for optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624875/","displayDocTitle":"Four channel three-parallel Reed-Solomon decoder using S-DCME algorithm for optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637782","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624875/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four channel three-parallel Reed-Solomon decoder using S-DCME algorithm for optical communications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048348S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5624877,"authors":[{"name":"Jonghong Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Jonghong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407285800"},{"name":"Junho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37290235600"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8933-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8932-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8934-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"5624877","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":707},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624877","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check","LDPC codes","BCH codes","Euclidean geometry","decoders","bit-flipping algorithm","channel coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check codes","BCH codes","layered decoding","bit-flipping"]}],"abstract":"Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are promising for low code rate applications, however its competitiveness over BCH codes in the high code rate region is not well studied.

Hence reducing the computational complexities of DFTs is of great significance. Recently proposed cyclo-tomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due to their low multiplicative complexities. Unfortunately, they have very high additive complexities. Techniques such as common subexpression elimination (CSE) can be used to reduce the additive complexities of CFFTs, but their effectiveness for long DFTs is limited by their complexities. In this paper, we propose prime factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms (PFCFTs), which use CFFTs as sub-DFTs via the prime factor algorithm. When the length has co-prime factors, the short lengths of the sub-DFTs allow us to use CSE to significantly reduce their additive complexities. In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier transforms, our PFCFTs achieve reduced overall complexities when the lengths of DFTs are at least 255, and the improvement significantly increases as the length grows. This approach enables us to propose the first efficient DFTs with very long length (e.g., 4095-point) in the literature. Finally, our PFCFTs are also advantageous for hardware implementation due to their regular structure.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624887","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop On Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611783/5624758/05624887.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2010.5624887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prime factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms with reduced complexity over finite fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624887/","displayDocTitle":"Prime factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms with reduced complexity over finite fields","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11637791","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624887/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prime factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms with reduced complexity over finite fields","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16463S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611783","isNumber":"5624758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611783","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5624758","articleId":"5624887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5624932,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The purposes of these experiments were to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and eye-blink video sequences. The drivers were also monitored through a video camera. The changes in facial expression of the drivers were used as a standard index of drowsiness level. Error-Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) was employed as a multi-class classifier to estimate drowsiness level. The ordinary ECOC method was extended using a loss function for the decoding procedure to obtain class tendencies of each drowsiness level. We used a Neural Network-Based Decoding method to classify the drowsiness level. As a result, we obtained an extraordinarily high accuracy for estimation of drowsiness level. Comparisons were also made with the result of those from using the Loss-based Decoding ECOC (LD-ECOC).","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5624964","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1892","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610907/5624963/05624964.pdf","publicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2010.5624964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of drivers' drowsiness level using a Neural Network Based \u2018Error Correcting Output Coding\u2019 method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Decoding","Eyelids","Training","Driver circuits","Accuracy","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","electrocardiography","error correction codes","neural nets","traffic engineering computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drivers drowsiness estimation","Neural Network","error correcting output coding","eyelid closure","heart rate variability","laboratory experiments","proprietary driving simulator","electrocardiogram","ECG","eye-blink video sequences","video camera","facial expression","ECOC","multiclass classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of drivers' drowsiness level using a Neural Network Based \u2018Error Correcting Output Coding\u2019 method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5624964/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639548","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of drivers' drowsiness level using a Neural Network Based \u2018Error Correcting Output Coding\u2019 method","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061626S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610907","isNumber":"5624963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610907","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5624963","articleId":"5624964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5624968,"authors":[{"name":"Heidi Loose","affiliation":["Group Research & Advanced Engineering, Daimler Benz Aerospace, Germany"],"firstName":"Heidi","lastName":"Loose","id":"37568798000"},{"name":"Uwe Franke","affiliation":["Group Research & Advanced Engineering, Daimler Benz Aerospace, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Franke","id":"37283450400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7659-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7657-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7658-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"5624968","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":950},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Spline","Solid modeling","Three dimensional displays","Vehicles","Joints","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","splines (mathematics)","stereo image processing","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["B-spline-based road model","3D lane recognition","3D road course","left vertical road courses","clothoid model","lateral road course estimation","flexible road model","stereo measurements","road surface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5624968","abstract":"The assumption of a planar road is rarely fulfilled on rural roads and often violated in construction zones.

Our model provides an increase in estimation accuracy of 35% when compared to a baseline approach for processing probe vehicle data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5624994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11639359","htmlLink":"/document/5624994/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Estimating arterial traffic conditions using sparse probe data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating arterial traffic conditions using sparse probe data","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107678S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610907","isNumber":"5624963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610907","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5624963","articleId":"5624994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5625054,"authors":[{"name":"Assad Al Alam","affiliation":["Scania CV AB, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden"],"firstName":"Assad Al","lastName":"Alam","id":"38241807500"},{"name":"Ather Gattami","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ather","lastName":"Gattami","id":"37299769700"},{"name":"Karl Henrik Johansson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl Henrik","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37270842500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7659-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7657-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7658-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"5625054","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":2809},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental study on the fuel reduction potential of heavy duty vehicle platooning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Fuels","Lead","Roads","Mathematical model","Engines","Drag"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuel reduction potential","heavy duty vehicle platooning","vehicle industry","commercial adaptive cruise control","fuel consumption","air drag reduction"]}],"abstract":"Vehicle platooning has become important for the vehicle industry. Yet conclusive results with respect to the fuel reduction possibilities of platooning remain unclear. The focus in this study is the fuel reduction that heavy duty vehicle platooning enables and the analysis with respect to the influence of a commercial adaptive cruise control on the fuel consumption. Experimental results show that by using preview information of the road ahead from the lead vehicle, the adaptive cruise controller can reduce the fuel consumption. A study is undertaken for various masses of the lead vehicle. The results show that the best choice with respect to a heavier or lighter lead vehicle depends on the desired time gap. A maximum fuel reduction of 4.7-7.7% depending on the time gap, at a set speed of 70 km/h, can be obtained with two identical trucks. If the lead vehicle is 10 t lighter a corresponding 3.8-7.4% fuel reduction can be obtained depending on the time gap. Similarly if the lead vehicle is 10 t heavier a 4.3-6.9% fuel reduction can be obtained. All results indicate that a maximum fuel reduction can be achieved at a short relative distance, due to both air drag reduction and suitable control.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625054","publicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610907/5624963/05625054.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625054/","displayDocTitle":"An experimental study on the fuel reduction potential of heavy duty vehicle platooning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639459","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625054/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental study on the fuel reduction potential of heavy duty vehicle platooning","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056158S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610907","isNumber":"5624963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610907","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5624963","articleId":"5625054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5625066,"authors":[{"name":"Samah El-Tantawy","affiliation":["Civil Engineering Department, University of Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Samah","lastName":"El-Tantawy","id":"38495108100"},{"name":"Baher Abdulhai","affiliation":["ITS, University of Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Baher","lastName":"Abdulhai","id":"37329999800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7659-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7657-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7658-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"5625066","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","decentralised control","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","optimal control","road vehicles","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agent-based learning","decentralized traffic signal control","coordinated traffic signal control","adaptive traffic signal control","traffic congestion","optimal traffic control","integrated traffic control","multiple intersections","decentralized controllers","multiagent reinforcement learning","MARL","RL techniques","nonstationary environments","Q-learning-based acyclic signal control system","variable phasing sequence","multiphase intersection","vehicle delay","pretimed control strategy","q-learning control system","Webster pretimed optimized signal control strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625066","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624963","publicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610907/5624963/05625066.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An agent-based learning towards decentralized and coordinated traffic signal control","abstract":"Adaptive traffic signal control is a promising technique for alleviating traffic congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to tackle the optimal traffic control problem for a single agent. However, the ultimate goal is to develop integrated traffic control for multiple intersections. Integrated traffic control can be efficiently achieved using decentralized controllers. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an extension of RL techniques that makes it possible to decentralize multiple agents in a non-stationary environments. Most of the studies in the field of traffic signal control consider a stationary environment, an approach whose shortcomings are highlighted in this paper. A Q-Learning-based acyclic signal control system that uses a variable phasing sequence is developed. To investigate the appropriate state model for different traffic conditions, three models were developed, each with different state representation. The models were tested on a typical multiphase intersection to minimize the vehicle delay and were compared to the pre-timed control strategy as a benchmark. The Q-Learning control system consistently outperformed the widely used Webster pre-timed optimized signal control strategy under various traffic conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625066/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639506","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An agent-based learning towards decentralized and coordinated traffic signal control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An agent-based learning towards decentralized and coordinated traffic signal control","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05874S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610907","isNumber":"5624963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610907","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5624963","articleId":"5625066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5625072,"authors":[{"name":"Konsta Sirvio","affiliation":["Sirway Limited, Finland"],"firstName":"Konsta","lastName":"Sirvio","id":"37592241000"},{"name":"Jaakko Hollm\u00e9n","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Aalto University of Science and Technology, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Hollm\u00e9n","id":"37329978300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7659-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7657-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7658-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"5625072","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625072","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Maintenance engineering","Programming","Optimization","Gallium","Genetic algorithms","Genomics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["civil engineering","genetic algorithms","maintenance engineering","roads","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiyear network level road maintenance programming","variable neighbourhood search","road assets","road administration","net present value","optimisation problem","parallel genetic algorithm","service level upgrading","routine maintenance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625072","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610907/5624963/05625072.pdf","publicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","startPage":"581","endPage":"586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-year network level road maintenance programming by genetic algorithms and variable neighbourhood search","abstract":"Preservation of the value, accessibility and adequate service level of road assets is one of the main tasks of road administrations. Right timing of maintenance works both decrease the road user costs as well as maintenance costs maximising overall benefits to the society measured by Net Present Value (NPV). We present a problem of road maintenance programming as a large-scale optimisation problem, which we optimise with genetic algorithms (GA), a parallel version of GA, and a variable neighbourhood search as a post-processing step on the previous solutions. We also compared all the optimised solutions with a large number of random solutions. A case study in the Sindh Province of Pakistan shows that parallel genetic algorithms with variable neighbourhood search produce 50 percent better results compared to random sampling and 6 percent better compared to regular genetic algorithms.

These systems intend to help the driver avoid or mitigate accidents by automatically applying the brakes prior to an accident. Initially only rear-end collision were addressed but over time more accident types are incorporated and brakes are applied earlier and stronger, in order to increase the velocity reduction before the accident occurs. This paper describes one of the latest AEB systems called Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection (CWAB-PD). It helps the driver with avoiding both rear-end and pedestrian accidents by providing a warning and, if necessary, automatic braking using full braking power. A limited set of accident scenarios is selected to illustrate the theoretical and practical performance of this system. It is shown that the CWAB-PD system can avoid accidents up to 35 km/h and can mitigate accidents achieving an impact speed reduction of 35 km/h. To the best of the authors knowledge CWAB-PD is the only system on the market that automatically can avoid accidents with pedestrians.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Accidents","Safety","Lead","Driver circuits","Collision avoidance","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["braking","road accidents","road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision warning","pedestrian detection","automatic emergency braking system","velocity reduction","full auto brake","accident scenarios"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625077","publicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610907/5624963/05625077.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection - a practical example of Automatic Emergency Braking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection - a practical example of Automatic Emergency Braking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625077/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625077/","accessionNumber":"11639557","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection - a practical example of Automatic Emergency Braking","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041247S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610907","isNumber":"5624963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610907","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5624963","articleId":"5625077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":5625098,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan K.

A design methodology to convert a canonical bandpass network to the proposed matching configuration is also presented in detail. As a design example, a push-pull deep class-AB PA is implemented with a third-order output network in a standard 90 nm CMOS process. The leakage inductances of the on-chip 2:1 transformer are absorbed into the output matching to realize the third-order network with only two inductor footprints for area conservation. The amplifier achieves a 3 dB bandwidth from 5.2 to 13 GHz with 25.2 dBm peak and 21.6% peak PAE. The EVM for QPSK and 16-QAM signals both with 5 Msample/s are below 3.6% and 5.9% at the output 1 dB compression point. This verifies the PA's capability of amplifying a narrowband modulated signal whose center-tone can be programmed across a large frequency range. The measured BER for transmitting a truly broadband PRBS signal up to 7.5 Gb/s is less than 10 , demonstrating the PA's support for an instantaneous wide operation bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2077171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2077171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5625049/05625137.pdf","startPage":"2709","endPage":"2722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Broadband Power Amplifier With a Transformer-Based High-Order Output Matching Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Broadband Power Amplifier With a Transformer-Based High-Order Output Matching Network","volume":"45","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625137/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684797","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625137/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Broadband Power Amplifier With a Transformer-Based High-Order Output Matching Network","sourcePdf":"jssc-wang-2077171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133995S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5625049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5625049","articleId":"5625137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5625181,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Kitt","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement and Control, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Kitt","id":"37541710700"},{"name":"Benjamin Ranft","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement and Control, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Ranft","id":"38537016200"},{"name":"Henning Lategahn","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement and Control, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Lategahn","id":"37402597000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7659-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7657-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7658-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"5625181","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":609},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Optical imaging","Estimation","Adaptive optics","Geometry","Optical distortion","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","image matching","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block matching","optical flow estimation","reduced search space","geometric constraints","image sequences","epipolar geometry","virtual images","axial stereo camera setup","computational complexity","correspondence search"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a new block-matching based approach for the estimation of nearly dense optical flow fields in image sequences. We focus on applications to autonomous vehicles where a dominant movement of the camera along its optical axis is present. The presented algorithm exploits the geometric relations between the two viewpoints induced by the epipolar geometry, hence it is applicable for the static parts of the scene. These relations are used to remap the images so that the resulting virtual images are similar to images captured by an axial stereo camera setup. This alignment dramatically reduces the computational complexity of the correspondence search and avoids false correspondences e.g. caused by repeated patterns.

However, most of these methods can only deal with data recorded at regular time intervals, thereby restricting the range of data collection tools to loop detectors or other equipment that generate regular data. The study reported here represents an attempt to expand on several existing time series forecasting methods to accommodate data recorded at irregular time intervals, thus ensuring these methods can be used to obtain predicted traffic speeds through intermittent data sources such as the GPS. The study tested several methods using the GPS data from 480 Hong Kong taxis.

The factored state space, modeling the causal dependencies, allows to describe the models in a compact fashion and reduces the computational complexity of the inference process. The filter is evaluated in the context of a highway scenario, showing a good performance even with very noisy measurements.

The discrete versions of Fourier transformation - DFT (Discrete FT) and FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) are most commonly used. That one-dimension frequency analysis is sufficient in many cases.

There are a lot of time-frequency representations (TFR) for presenting measured signal. The most common known are spectrogram (SPEC) and Gabor Transform (GT), which are based on direct DFT results. However, the method has relatively low time-frequency resolution. The other TFR representing Cohen class: Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and its variants: Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD), Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) and Gabor-Wigner Transform (GWT) are described in the paper.

The commonly used windowed interpolated FFT algorithm (WIFFTA) can improve the measurement accuracy by windowing the time samples and interpolating the DFT coefficients, but the accuracy is restricted by the frequency resolution. A new algorithm for harmonic analysis is proposed in this paper, which tries to adjust the actual sample sequence to an ideal sampling sequence synchronous with the original signal on the basis of the time-domain Newton's interpolation algorithm. Simulation results show this algorithm can increase the accuracy of harmonic analysis by reducing spectral leakage efficiently despite the variation of frequency resolution. In addition, it can improve the computation efficiency and it is suitable to analyze the fluctuating signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625379","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5612395/5625304/05625379.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm for harmonic analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm for harmonic analysis","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625379/","accessionNumber":"11638448","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625379/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm for harmonic analysis","confLoc":"Bergamo, Italy","sourcePdf":"613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.183798S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5612395","isNumber":"5625304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5612395","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5625304","articleId":"5625379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5625388,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Classification is performed using modular neural network with features extracted from S-transform. Modular neural network is designed by modifying the structure of traditional multilayer network into modules for each disturbance to provide less training period and better classification.

The method dynamically determines the resampling moments of a given signal that was originally sampled at a fixed rate. This process is based on real-time frequency tracking (fundamental component) by means of a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) structure. Then, the values of the signal in the resampling moments are approximated by piecewise polynomials interpolation functions (Splines). This process is performed in an iterative way, so that a period of the resampled signal always contains the same integer number N of samples. The performance of the method for real-time harmonics tracking in common situations of asynchronous sampling is evaluated by applying the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) in the resampled signal using sliding windows. The simulation results show that the use of the method can effectively reduce the energy spreading effect (leakage) caused by asynchronous sampling and improve the estimates accuracy of the analyzed signal harmonics components significantly.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625414","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5612395/5625304/05625414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of Dynamic Resampling for DFT-based harmonic analysis under time-varying frequency conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A method of Dynamic Resampling for DFT-based harmonic analysis under time-varying frequency conditions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638482","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of Dynamic Resampling for DFT-based harmonic analysis under time-varying frequency conditions","confLoc":"Bergamo, Italy","sourcePdf":"311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061437S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5612395","isNumber":"5625304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5612395","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5625304","articleId":"5625414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5625424,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The STATCOM is used for adjusting the voltage in line and the dynamic effect of STATCOM is considered. The design of PSS and STATCOM parameters is considered as an optimization problem and Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is used for searching optimized parameters. The introduced objective function in this paper is based on the system modes of oscillation considering all modes in the objective function. The participation factors method is used for identifying the type of each mode. The study is performed on the linearized power system model with presence of STATCOM and PSS. The analysis of the eigenvalue method is used for optimal parameter adjustment. These studies are performed for five operating points. The design is performed using nonlinear simulation. The results show that the design according to simultaneous optimization is an effective procedure for power system stability improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625436","pdfPath":"/iel5/5612395/5625304/05625436.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal regulation of STATCOM controllers and PSS parameters Using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal regulation of STATCOM controllers and PSS parameters Using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638504","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625436/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal regulation of STATCOM controllers and PSS parameters Using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Bergamo, Italy","sourcePdf":"1505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049609S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5612395","isNumber":"5625304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5612395","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5625304","articleId":"5625436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-19"},{"_id":5625437,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The ability of static VAr compensator (SVC) in flicker reduction is limited by delays in reactive power measurements and thyristor ignition. To improve the SVC performance in flicker compensation, EAF reactive power can be predicted for a half cycle ahead by using appropriate ARMA models. This paper uses huge field data, collected from eight arc furnaces and demonstrates that the EAF reactive power models coefficients and their variations are different from one data record to another. Therefore it is necessary to update the model coefficients for prediction purposes. For this purpose, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the prediction relationship coefficients online. By applying the method to the data records and using some indices such as newly defined indices based on concepts of flicker frequencies and power spectral density, the transient and steady state performances of the method are studied in EAF reactive power prediction and compared with those of normalized least mean square (NLMS) and recursive least square (RLS) algorithms. It is demonstrated that the overall performance of online GA is better than of other two algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625437","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5612395/5625304/05625437.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Updating stochastic models of arc furnace reactive power by genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Gallium","Predictive models","Furnaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arc furnaces","autoregressive moving average processes","genetic algorithms","reactive power","static VAr compensators","stochastic processes","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["updating stochastic models","electric arc furnace reactive power","genetic algorithm","static VAr compensator","SVC","flicker reduction","delays","reactive power measurements","thyristor ignition","flicker compensation","ARMA models","EAF reactive power model coefficients","flicker frequency","power spectral density","transient analysis","EAF reactive power prediction","normalized least mean square algorithm","NLMS","recursive least square algorithms","voltage fluctuations","prediction relationship coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric arc furnace","ARMA models","Prediction","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Updating stochastic models of arc furnace reactive power by genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625437/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638505","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Updating stochastic models of arc furnace reactive power by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Bergamo, Italy","sourcePdf":"1506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09382S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5612395","isNumber":"5625304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5612395","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5625304","articleId":"5625437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5625501,"authors":[{"name":"Sean Elphick","affiliation":["Integral Energy Power Quality and Reliability Centre, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5612395/5625304/5625501/5625501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sean Elphick graduated from the University of Wollongong with a BE (Elec)(Hons) degree in 2002.

The paper also highlights the key power quality issues affecting Australian electricity networks at the present time. These include high voltage levels at LV sites and difficulties in measurement of voltage unbalance. The longevity of the survey has allowed better understanding of disturbance trend levels. Interesting results include an apparent reduction in harmonic levels in the past couple of years and no definite trend in sag levels even with 7 years worth of data. Some of the challenges involved in conducting a survey of this type are explored and indications as to solutions presented. With the implementation of smart grid concepts it is likely that the number of sites with instrumentation capable of supplying data to the survey will increase exponentially. This presents a new set of challenges and the survey must adapt to these. Future directions taken in response include the implementation of web-based reporting systems which will provide more flexibility for participants.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power quality","Monitoring","Instruments","Indexes","Electricity","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power markets","power supply quality","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Australian long term power quality survey project update","Australian Long Term National Power Quality Survey","LTNPQS","multi-utility power quality survey","Australian electricity networks","LV sites","voltage unbalance measurement","disturbance trend levels","harmonic levels","sag levels","smart grid concepts","Web-based reporting systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Harmonics","power quality data analysis","power quality monitoring","unbalance","voltage","voltage sags"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625501","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power - ICHQP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5612395/5625304/05625501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2010.5625501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Australian Long Term Power Quality Survey project update","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Australian Long Term Power Quality Survey project update","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625501/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625501/","accessionNumber":"11638566","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Australian Long Term Power Quality Survey project update","confLoc":"Bergamo, Italy","sourcePdf":"936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043484S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5612395","isNumber":"5625304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5612395","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5625304","articleId":"5625501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5625531,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For less complex logic structures like for example FIR filters such generic cost models can be derived easily because they base on a simple gate count. For LDPC decoders the influence of the global interconnect between the two basic components of such a decoder complicates the derivation of general cost models. This might be the reason why no accurate cost models are known from literature yet. In this paper generic silicon area, iteration period, and energy cost models of high-throughput LDPC decoders are derived. Those models do not only allow for a decoding-performance vs. hardware-cost trade-off analysis during system specification but can also be used later on to choose a suitable architecture for a certain specification. Finally these models can be used for a fair benchmarking of the implemented decoder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC decoder area, timing, and energy models for early quantitative hardware cost estimates","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2010.5625546","startPage":"169","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2010.5625546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625509","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on System on Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on System on Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610911/5625509/05625546.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"LDPC decoder area, timing, and energy models for early quantitative hardware cost estimates","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625546/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639576","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC decoder area, timing, and energy models for early quantitative hardware cost estimates","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092924S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610911","isNumber":"5625509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610911","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5625509","articleId":"5625546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5625562,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Airoldi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Airoldi","id":"37589418900"},{"name":"Fabio Garzia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Garzia","id":"37423092900"},{"name":"Omer Anjum","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Anjum","id":"37603027300"},{"name":"Jari Nurmi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Nurmi","id":"37274976400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8278-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8279-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8277-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5625562","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Computer architecture","Receivers","Reduced instruction set computing","Field programmable gate arrays","Baseband","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems","OFDM modulation","signal processing","software radio","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["homogeneous MPSoC","baseband signal processing engine","OFDM system","multiprocessor system-on-chip","software defined radio","IEEE 802.11a standard","mesh topology","network-on-chip","COFFEE RISC processor","ALTERA STRATIX IV FPGA","frequency 180 MHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a homogeneous Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) as baseband signal processing engine for software defined radio applications.

The architecture was prototyped on an ALTERA STRATIX IV FPGA working at a maximum frequency of 180 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2010.5625562","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on System on Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on System on Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610911/5625509/05625562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2010.5625562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625509","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homogeneous MPSoC as baseband signal processing engine for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Homogeneous MPSoC as baseband signal processing engine for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639584","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homogeneous MPSoC as baseband signal processing engine for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064669S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610911","isNumber":"5625509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610911","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5625509","articleId":"5625562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5625566,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Pande","affiliation":["Bio-Inspired Electronics and Reconfigurable Computing Research Group (BIRC), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Pande","id":"37529482000"},{"name":"Fearghal Morgan","affiliation":["Bio-Inspired Electronics and Reconfigurable Computing Research Group (BIRC), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland"],"firstName":"Fearghal","lastName":"Morgan","id":"37320848000"},{"name":"Seamus Cawley","affiliation":["Bio-Inspired Electronics and Reconfigurable Computing Research Group (BIRC), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland"],"firstName":"Seamus","lastName":"Cawley","id":"37547519800"},{"name":"Brian McGinley","affiliation":["National University of Ireland, Dublin, IE"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"McGinley"},{"name":"Snaider Carrillo","affiliation":["Magee Campus, University of Ulster, Derry, Northern Ireland"],"firstName":"Snaider","lastName":"Carrillo","id":"37589624700"},{"name":"Jim Harkin","affiliation":["Magee Campus, University of Ulster, Derry, Northern Ireland"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Harkin","id":"37297997900"},{"name":"Liam McDaid","affiliation":["University of Ulster, Coleraine, Londonderry, GB"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"McDaid"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8278-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8279-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8277-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5625566","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Computer architecture","Topology","Radiation detectors","Generators","Hardware","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","low-power electronics","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","network-on-chip","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMBRACE-SysC","NoC-based spiking neural network architectures","mixed signal network on chip","genetic algorithm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMBRACE-SysC for analysis of NoC-based Spiking Neural Network architectures","abstract":"This paper presents EMBRACE-SysC, a simulation-based design exploration framework for the EMBRACE mixed signal Network on Chip (NoC)-based hardware Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture.

With full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and receiver, its capacity is shown to be essentially SNR log(1SNR) nats/symbol, as SNR goes to zero. In fact, this rate can be achieved with a just one bit of CSI at the transmitter (per fading realization) and with no receiver CSI. The capacity for the case of noisy transmitter CSI is also found. Then a Rayleigh block fading channel of coherence interval T \u2264 1/ SNR is considered which has causal feedback and no a priori CSI. A training based scheme is proposed for such channels, which achieves a rate of SNR logT nats/symbol in the limit of small SNR and large T. Thus, when coherence interval T is of the order 1/SNR, without any a priori CSI at either end, the capacity with full CSI at both ends is achievable. For smaller values of T, a rate of SNR logT nats/symbol is shown to be achievable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625617.pdf","startPage":"6058","endPage":"6065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Fading Channels With Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Channel state information","Coherence","Wideband","Signal to noise ratio","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh flat fading channel","SNR","channel state information","transmitter","receiver","CSI","causal feedback","block fading channel","coherence interval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block fading","channel state information","coherence interval","fading channel","feedback capacity","low SNR","noisy CSI","wideband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Fading Channels With Feedback","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625617/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655668","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Fading Channels With Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-borade-2080490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04888S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625620,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany","Heinrich Hertz Chair for Mobile Communications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Holger Boche (M'04\u2013SM'07) received his Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.

Each node has some real-valued initial measurement or message. The goal of each of the nodes is to acquire an estimate of a given function of all the initial measurements in the network. As the main contribution of this paper, a lower bound on computation time is derived. This bound must be satisfied by any algorithm used by the nodes to communicate and compute, so that the mean-square error in the nodes' estimate is within a given interval around zero. The derivation utilizes information theoretic inequalities reminiscent of those used in rate distortion theory along with a novel \u201cperturbation\u201d technique so as to be broadly applicable. To understand the tightness of the bound, a specific scenario is considered. Nodes are required to learn a linear combination of the initial values in the network while communicating over erasure channels. A distributed quantized algorithm is developed, and it is shown that the computation time essentially scales as is implied by the lower bound. In particular, the computation time depends reciprocally on \u201cconductance\u201d, which is a property of the network that captures the information-flow bottleneck. As a by-product, this leads to a quantized algorithm, for computing separable functions in a network, with minimal computation time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625621.pdf","startPage":"6020","endPage":"6039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Distributed Computation Over Networks of Point-to-Point Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate distortion theory","Noise measurement","Memoryless systems","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","mean square error methods","memoryless systems","perturbation techniques","radio links","rate distortion theory","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed computation","point-to-point memoryless independent noisy channel","information theoretic bound","mean-square error method","rate distortion theory","perturbation technique","erasure channel","distributed quantized algorithm","information flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computation time","conductance","distributed computing","noisy networks","quantized summation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Distributed Computation Over Networks of Point-to-Point Channels","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625621/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655671","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Distributed Computation Over Networks of Point-to-Point Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-ayaso-2080850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112331S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625622,"authors":[{"name":"Behtash Babadi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Behtash Babadi (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree in engineering sciences from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 2008, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in engineering sciences at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.","His research interests include dynamic spectrum access networks, adaptive signal processing, and compressed sensing."]},"firstName":"Behtash","lastName":"Babadi","id":"37391447200"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Vahid Tarokh (M'97\u2013SM'02\u2013F'09) received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 1995.","He worked at AT&T Labs-Research until August 2000, where he was the Head of the Department of Wireless Communications and Signal Processing.

A greedy asynchronous distributed interference avoidance (GADIA) algorithm for horizontal spectrum sharing has been proposed that achieves performance close to that of a centralized optimal algorithm. The convergence of the GADIA algorithm to a near-optimal frequency allocation strategy is proved and several asymptotic performance bounds have been established for various spatial configurations of the network nodes. Furthermore, the near-equilibrium dynamics of the GADIA algorithm has been studied using the Glauber dynamics, by identifying the problem with the antiferromagnetic inhomogeneous long-range Potts model. Using the near-equilibrium dynamics and methods from stochastic analysis, the robustness of the algorithm with respect to time variations in the activity of network nodes is studied. These analytic results along with simulation studies reveal that the performance is close to that of an optimum centralized frequency allocation algorithm. Further simulation studies confirm that our proposed algorithm outperforms the iterative water-filling algorithm in the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regime, in terms of achieved sum rate, complexity, convergence rate, and robustness to time-varying node activities.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2081090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2081090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","startPage":"6228","endPage":"6252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GADIA: A Greedy Asynchronous Distributed Interference Avoidance Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GADIA: A Greedy Asynchronous Distributed Interference Avoidance Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661288","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625622/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GADIA: A Greedy Asynchronous Distributed Interference Avoidance Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tit-babadi-2081090-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.295961S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625625,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Misra","affiliation":["Advanced Video and Display Technology Group, Sharp Laboratories of America, Inc.orporated, Camas, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kiran Misra (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Mumbai University, Mumbai, India, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Michigan State University (MSU), East Lansing, in 2002 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the area of video coding algorithms with the Advanced Video and Display Technology (AVDT) Department, Sharp Laboratories of America, Camas, WA.

In particular, this perspective of code-on-network-graphs (CNG) can be exploited to map source data generated within WSN (of size K) to a variable nodes subset in low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The resulting fixed size symbol stream when transmitted through the network suffers erasures. At sink, an average of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z</i>\n source symbols can be recovered by employing belief propagation decoding. In this paper, we determine CNG code ensembles that achieve maximal recovery (z/K) for different erasure rates and network topological constraints corresponding to node transmission range. An analytic framework to predict code performance under transmission range constraints is developed. Additionally, necessary condition for code stability was derived using fixed-point stability analysis. Optimal solutions for a WSN with 1000 nodes are determined using differential evolution algorithm. We outline a distributed algorithm for generating a sequence of encoded symbols adhering to the designed code ensemble. The performance of the designed CNG code is demonstrated to be superior to random NC and growth code based ensembles, as well as resilient to network size and inter-connectivity variations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625625.pdf","startPage":"6317","endPage":"6331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximal Recovery Network Coding Under Topology Constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Parity check codes","Stability analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Network coding","Belief propagation","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","evolutionary computation","graph theory","network coding","parity check codes","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximal recovery network coding","network topological constraints","wireless sensor networks","code-on-network-graphs","low-density parity check codes","fixed size symbol stream","CNG code","distributed algorithm","differential evolution algorithm","fixed-point stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes","network channel coding","network coding (NC)","partial recovery","wireless sensor networks (WSN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Maximal Recovery Network Coding Under Topology Constraint","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625625/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661289","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal Recovery Network Coding Under Topology Constraint","sourcePdf":"tit-misra-2080610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100462S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625632,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

In this paper, we treat both forms of probabilistic inference, estimating marginal probabilities of the joint distribution and finding the most probable assignment, through a unified message-passing algorithm architecture. In particular we generalize the belief propagation (BP) algorithms of sum-product and max-product and tree-reweighted (TRW) sum and max product algorithms (TRBP) and introduce a new set of convergent algorithms based on \u201cconvex-free-energy\u201d and linear-programming (LP) relaxation as a zero-temperature of a convex-free-energy. The main idea of this work arises from taking a general perspective on the existing BP and TRBP algorithms while observing that they all are reductions from the basic optimization formula of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n +\u03a3\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ihi</i>\n where the function \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n is an extended-valued, strictly convex but nonsmooth and the functions \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hi</i>\n are extended-valued functions (not necessarily convex). We use tools from convex duality to present the \u201cprimal-dual ascent\u201d algorithm which is an extension of the Bregman successive projection scheme and is designed to handle optimization of the general type \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n + \u03a3\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ihi</i>\n. We then map the fractional-free-energy variational principle for approximate inference onto the optimization formula above and introduce the \u201cnorm-product\u201d message-passing algorithm. Special cases of the norm-product include sum-product and max-product (BP algorithms), TRBP and NMPLP algorithms. When the fractional-free-energy is set to be convex (convex-free-energy) the norm-product is globally convergent for the estimation of marginal probabilities and for approximating the LP-relaxation. We also introduce another branch of the norm-product which arises as the \u201czero-temperature\u201d of the convex-free-energy which we refer to as the \u201cconvex-max-product\u201d. The convex-max-product is convergent (unlike max-product) and aims at solving the LP- relaxation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","volume":"56","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11655674","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625635/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Norm-Product Belief Propagation: Primal-Dual Message-Passing for Approximate Inference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Norm-Product Belief Propagation: Primal-Dual Message-Passing for Approximate Inference","sourcePdf":"tit-hazan-2079014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142979S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5625637,"authors":[{"name":"Deniz G\u00fcnd\u00fcz","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Stanford, CA, USA","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Deniz G\u00fcnd\u00fcz (S'02\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York University (formerly Polytechnic University), Brooklyn, NY, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate at CTTC, Barcelona, Spain.

In particular, a model is studied in which a relay station simultaneously assists two transmitters in multicasting their independent messages to two receivers. The relay may also have an independent message of its own to multicast. As a first step to address this general model, referred to as the compound multiple access channel with a relay (cMACr), the capacity region of the multiple access channel with a \u201ccognitive\u201d relay is characterized, including the cases of partial and rate-limited cognition. Then, achievable rate regions for the cMACr model are presented based on decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying strategies. Moreover, an outer bound is derived for the special case, called the cMACr without cross-reception, in which each transmitter has a direct link to one of the receivers while the connection to the other receiver is enabled only through the relay terminal. The capacity region is characterized for a binary modulo additive cMACr without cross-reception, showing the optimality of binary linear block codes, and thus highlighting the benefits of physical layer network coding and structured codes.

If the feedback rate is limited, what state information to feed back and how to encode it are important questions. This paper studies power loading in a multicarrier system using no more than one bit of feedback per subchannel. The subchannels can be correlated and full channel state information is assumed at the receiver. First, a simple model with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n parallel two-state (good/bad) memoryless subchannels is considered, where the channel state feedback is used to select a fixed number of subchannels to activate. The optimal feedback scheme is the solution to a vector quantization problem, and the associated performance for large N is characterized using a rate distortion function. As N increases, the loss in forward rate from the asymptotic (rate-distortion) value is shown to decrease as (logN)/N and \u221a{(logN)/N} with optimal variable- and fixed-length feedback codes, respectively. These results are subsequently extended to parallel Rayleigh block fading subchannels, where the feedback designates a set of subchannels to be activated with equal power. Rate-distortion feedback codes are proposed for designating subsets of (good) subchannels with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that exceed a threshold. The associated performance is compared with that of a simpler lossless source coding scheme, which designates groups of good subchannels, where both the group size and threshold are optimized. The rate-distortion codes can provide a significant increase in forward rate at low SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080970","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625638.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"6116","endPage":"6132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited-Rate Channel State Feedback for Multicarrier Block Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Limited-Rate Channel State Feedback for Multicarrier Block Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625638/","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625638/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655678","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited-Rate Channel State Feedback for Multicarrier Block Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-guo-2080970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152142S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5625639,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Babu Korada","affiliation":["EPFL, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland","Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Satish Babu Korada (S'09) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2009.","Since September 2009, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

They achieve the symmetric capacity of arbitrary binary-input discrete memoryless channels under a low complexity successive cancellation decoding scheme. The original polar code construction is closely related to the recursive construction of Reed-Muller codes and is based on the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix [1 0 : 1 1]. It was shown by Arikan Telatar that this construction achieves an error exponent of 1/2, i.e., that for sufficiently large blocklengths the error probability decays exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. It was already mentioned by Arikan that in principle larger matrices can be used to construct polar codes. In this paper, it is first shown that any \u2113 \u00d7 \u2113 matrix none of whose column permutations is upper triangular polarizes binary-input memoryless channels. The exponent of a given square matrix is characterized, upper and lower bounds on achievable exponents are given. Using these bounds it is shown that there are no matrices of size smaller than 15\u00d715 with exponents exceeding 1/2. Further, a general construction based on BCH codes which for large I achieves exponents arbitrarily close to 1 is given. At size 16 \u00d7 16, this construction yields an exponent greater than 1/2.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080990","startPage":"6253","endPage":"6264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625639.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar Codes: Characterization of Exponent, Bounds, and Constructions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Polar Codes: Characterization of Exponent, Bounds, and Constructions","volume":"56","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11661296","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625639/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar Codes: Characterization of Exponent, Bounds, and Constructions","sourcePdf":"tit-sasoglu-2080990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07692S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5625640,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["Broadband Communications and Wireless Systems (BCWS) Centre, Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada","Wireless Innovations Laboratory (WIL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran","Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"},{"name":"Amir H.

We use entropy constrained lattice vector quantization and restrict attention to simple reconstruction functions, which are given by the inverse IA function when all descriptions are received or otherwise by a weighted average of the received descriptions. We consider smooth sources with finite differential entropy rate and MSE fidelity criterion. As in previous designs, our construction is based on nested lattices which are combined through a single IA function. The results are exact under high-resolution conditions and asymptotically as the nesting ratios of the lattices approach infinity. For any n, the design is asymptotically optimal within the class of IA-based schemes. Moreover, in the case of two descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions greater than one, the performance is strictly better than that of existing designs. In the case of three descriptions, we show that in the limit of large lattice vector dimensions, points on the inner bound of Pradhan can be achieved. Furthermore, for three descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions, we show that the IA-based approach yields, in the symmetric case, a smaller rate loss than the recently proposed source-splitting approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625642.pdf","startPage":"6354","endPage":"6375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"--Channel Asymmetric Entropy-Constrained Multiple-Description Lattice Vector Quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625642/","displayDocTitle":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex> </formula>-Channel Asymmetric Entropy-Constrained Multiple-Description Lattice Vector Quantization","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655684","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625642/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex> </formula>-Channel Asymmetric Entropy-Constrained Multiple-Description Lattice Vector Quantization","sourcePdf":"tit-ostergaard-2080411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132126S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625643,"authors":[{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Narayan Prasad received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, in 1999 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2004.","He is currently a Senior Research Staff Member at NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ.

Specifically, the problem of distributed phase alignment is considered, where neither the transmitters nor the receiver has perfect channel state information, but there is a low-rate feedback link from the receiver to the transmitters. In this setting, a framework is proposed for systematically analyzing the performance of distributed beamforming schemes. To illustrate the advantage of this framework, a simple adaptive distributed beamforming scheme that was recently proposed by Mudambai et al. is studied. Two important properties of the received signal magnitude function are derived. Using these properties and the systematic framework, it is shown that the adaptive distributed beamforming scheme converges both in probability and in mean. Furthermore, it is established that the time required for the adaptive scheme to converge in mean scales linearly with respect to the number of sensor/relay nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2080590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625651.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2080590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"6133","endPage":"6141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Random Search Framework for Convergence Analysis of Distributed Beamforming With Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Random Search Framework for Convergence Analysis of Distributed Beamforming With Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625651/","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625651/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655682","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Random Search Framework for Convergence Analysis of Distributed Beamforming With Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-veeravalli-2080590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065183S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625652,"authors":[{"name":"Vladislav B.

As opposed to the existing result on the asymptotic behavior of maximum-likelihood estimation in hidden Markov models, the results of this paper are obtained without assuming that the log-likelihood function has an isolated maximum at which the Hessian is strictly negative definite.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyticity, Convergence, and Convergence Rate of Recursive Maximum-Likelihood Estimation in Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2081110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5625612/05625652.pdf","startPage":"6406","endPage":"6432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2081110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Analyticity, Convergence, and Convergence Rate of Recursive Maximum-Likelihood Estimation in Hidden Markov Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5625652/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyticity, Convergence, and Convergence Rate of Recursive Maximum-Likelihood Estimation in Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"tit-tadic-2081110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159662S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5625612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5625612","articleId":"5625652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625653,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohu Tang","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaohu Tang (M'04) received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from the Northwest Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 1992, 1995, and 2001, respectively.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a postdoctoral researcher with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The capability of microwave signals to penetrate light opaque materials and sense distant or inaccessible objects with reasonable spatial resolution makes them attractive for different industrial, civil and medical applications. Our Through-the-Wall Microwave Imaging (TWMI) radar system facilitates us to detect and localize objects behind the wall. Measurements with mono-static radar configuration are made with various sizes of metallic materials inside the room with wooden wall (of known thickness and dielectric constant) using 2D antenna positioning assembly and scattering data is recorded in frequency domain. The simple and fast algorithm for compensation of different wave velocity inside the wall is used and the measured raw data is processed with 2D SAR Beamforming algorithm in time domain to reconstruct the image of the targets behind wall. This paper provides an overview of the basic concepts, foundation prototype system of TWMI, SAR Beamforming algorithm and Comparison of Various matched filter approaches and their effects on quality of image are elaborated in detail.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625666","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information and Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5615426/5625666/05625725.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D Beamforming for Through-the-Wall Microwave Imaging applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625725/","displayDocTitle":"2D Beamforming for Through-the-Wall Microwave Imaging applications","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11639067","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D Beamforming for Through-the-Wall Microwave Imaging applications","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"iciet20100submission047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046627S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5615426","isNumber":"5625666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5615426","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5625666","articleId":"5625725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5625731,"authors":[{"name":"Yasir Mehmood","affiliation":["National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"37089146309"},{"name":"Muhammad Ishtiaq","affiliation":["National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ishtiaq","id":"37590717500"},{"name":"Muhammad Tariq","affiliation":["National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Tariq","id":"37283193700"},{"name":"M.

Through analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed frequency-coupled detector can significantly outperform the traditional decoupled one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11675047","htmlLink":"/document/5625894/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios With Correlated Subband Occupancy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios With Correlated Subband Occupancy","sourcePdf":"lsp-hossain-2091405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044028S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5640365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5640365","articleId":"5625894","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5625898,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwoo Joh","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jungwoo Joh received the B.S. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 2002 to 2005, he was with Alticast, Seoul, Korea, as a Software Engineer.

The bag-of-words model has become the most powerful method for visual categorization of images and video. Despite its high accuracy, a severe drawback of this model is its high computational cost. As the trend to increase computational power in newer CPU and GPU architectures is to increase their level of parallelism, exploiting this parallelism becomes an important direction to handle the computational cost of the bag-of-words approach. When optimizing a system based on the bag-of-words approach, the goal is to minimize the time it takes to process batches of images. this paper, we analyze the bag-of-words model for visual categorization in terms of computational cost and identify two major bottlenecks: the quantization step and the classification step. We address these two bottlenecks by proposing two efficient algorithms for quantization and classification by exploiting the GPU hardware and the CUDA parallel programming model. The algorithms are designed to (1) keep categorization accuracy intact, (2) decompose the problem, and (3) give the same numerical results. In the experiments on large scale datasets, it is shown that, by using a parallel implementation on the Geforce GTX260 GPU, classifying unseen images is 4.8 times faster than a quad-core CPU version on the Core i7 920, while giving the exact same numerical results. In addition, we show how the algorithms can be generalized to other applications, such as text retrieval and video retrieval. Moreover, when the obtained speedup is used to process extra video frames in a video retrieval benchmark, the accuracy of visual categorization is improved by 29%.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5689344/05625914.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empowering Visual Categorization With the GPU","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2010.2091400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2010.2091400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Empowering Visual Categorization With the GPU","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759418","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5625914/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empowering Visual Categorization With the GPU","sourcePdf":"tmm-vandesande-2091400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11474S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5689344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5689344","articleId":"5625914","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625920,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok Patel","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Patel","id":"37544633500"},{"name":"Bart Kosko","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Kosko","id":"37284621500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5625920","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Quantizer noise can improve statistical signal detection in array-based nonlinear correlators in Neyman-Pearson and maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. This holds even for infinite-variance symmetric alpha-stable channel noise and for generalized-Gaussian channel noise. Noise-enhanced correlation detection leads to noise-enhanced watermark extraction based on such nonlinear detection at the pixel or bit level. This yields a noise-based algorithm for digital watermark decoding using two new noise-benefit theorems. The first theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for quantizer noise to increase the detection probability of a constant signal for a fixed false-alarm probability if the channel noise is symmetric and if the sample size is large. The second theorem shows that the array must contain more than one quantizer for such a stochastic-resonance noise benefit if the symmetric channel noise is unimodal. It also shows that the noise-benefit rate improves in the small-quantizer noise limit as the number of array quantizers increases. The second theorem further shows that symmetric uniform quantizer noise gives the optimal rate for an initial noise benefit among all finite-variance symmetric scale-family noise. Two corollaries give similar results for stochastic-resonance noise benefits in ML detection of a signal sequence with known shape but unknown amplitude.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05625920.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2091409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2091409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Benefits in Quantizer-Array Correlation Detection and Watermark Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Detectors","Strontium","Watermarking","Arrays","Correlation","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","image denoising","image watermarking","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","probability","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantizer-array correlation detection","quantizer noise","statistical signal detection","array-based nonlinear correlator","Neyman-Pearson detection","maximum-likelihood detection","ML detection","infinite-variance symmetric alpha-stable channel noise","generalized Gaussian channel noise","noise-enhanced correlation detection","noise-enhanced watermark extraction","digital watermark decoding","detection probability","fixed false-alarm probability","stochastic-resonance noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum-likelihood (ML) detection","Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection","noise benefits","nonlinear correlation detectors","quantizer arrays","quantizer noise","scale-family noise","stochastic resonance","watermark decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Noise Benefits in Quantizer-Array Correlation Detection and Watermark Decoding","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742845","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Benefits in Quantizer-Array Correlation Detection and Watermark Decoding","sourcePdf":"tsp-kosko-2091409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077273S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","articleId":"5625920","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625921,"authors":[{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5685344/5625921/5625921-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao He (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2009, both in electrical engineering.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville.

This waveform diversity can lead to flexible transmit beampattern synthesis, which is useful in many applications such as radar/sonar and biomedical imaging. In the past literature most attention was paid to receive beampattern design due to the stringent constraints on waveforms in the transmit beampattern case. Recently progress has been made on MIMO transmit beampattern synthesis but mainly only for narrowband signals. In this paper we propose a new approach that can be used to efficiently synthesize MIMO waveforms in order to match a given wideband transmit beampattern, i.e., to match a transmit energy distribution in both space and frequency. The synthesized waveforms satisfy the unit-modulus or low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) constraints that are highly desirable in practice. Several examples are provided to investigate the performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2091410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05625921.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2091410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband MIMO Systems: Signal Design for Transmit Beampattern Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625921/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband MIMO Systems: Signal Design for Transmit Beampattern Synthesis","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742847","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625921/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband MIMO Systems: Signal Design for Transmit Beampattern Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2091410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067892S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5625921","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5625922,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Taheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5685344/5625922/5625922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omid Taheri (S'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

An analog signal measured by a number of parallel branches of mixers and integrators (BMIs), each characterized by a specific random sampling waveform, is first segmented in time into segments. Then the subsamples collected on different segments and different BMIs are reused so that a larger number of samples (at most ) than the number of BMIs is collected. This technique is shown to be equivalent to extending the measurement matrix, which consists of the BMI sampling waveforms, by adding new rows without actually increasing the number of BMIs. We prove that the extended measurement matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property with overwhelming probability if the original measurement matrix of BMI sampling waveforms satisfies it. We also prove that the signal recovery performance can be improved if our segmented CS-based AIC is used for sampling instead of the conventional AIC with the same number of BMIs. Therefore, the reconstruction quality can be improved by slightly increasing (by times) the sampling rate per each BMI. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed segmented CS method and the validity of our theoretical results. Particularly, our simulation results show significant signal recovery performance improvement when the segmented CS-based AIC is used instead of the conventional AIC with the same number of BMIs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Simulation","Sparse matrices","Indexes","Risk management","Vectors","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmented compressed sampling","analog-to-information conversion","analog signal","branches of mixers and integrators","random sampling waveform","extended measurement matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-information conversion (AIC)","compressed sampling (CS)","correlated random variables","Craig\u2013Bernstein inequality","empirical risk minimization","segmented AIC","segmented CS"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2091411","startPage":"554","endPage":"572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05625922.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2091411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmented Compressed Sampling for Analog-to-Information Conversion: Method and Performance Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmented Compressed Sampling for Analog-to-Information Conversion: Method and Performance Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11742844","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","volume":"59","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625922/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmented Compressed Sampling for Analog-to-Information Conversion: Method and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2091411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113152S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5625922","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5625923,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Zandi","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy (GREEN), Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL), Nancy University, Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5625923/5625923-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid Zandi received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran, in 1991 and the M.Sc. degree from the Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995.

The method is based on the flatness control technique (FCT) and fuzzy logic control (FLC). This EHPS is composed of a fuel cell system as the main source and two energy storage sources (ESSs)-a bank of supercapacitors (SCs) and a bank of batteries (BATs)-as the auxiliary source. With this hybridization, the volume and mass of the EHPS can be reduced, because the high energy density of BAT and high power density of SC are utilized. In the proposed novel control strategy, the FCT is used to manage the energy between the main and the auxiliary sources, and the FLC is employed to share the power flow in the ESS between the SC and the BAT. The power sharing depends on the load power and the state of charge of the SC and the BAT. EHPS is controlled by the regulation of the stored electrostatic energy in the dc buses. The main property of this strategy is that the energy management in the power source is carried out with a single general control algorithm in different operating modes, consequently avoiding any algorithm commutation. An EHPS test bench has been assembled and equipped with a real-time system controller based on a dSPACE. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2091433","startPage":"433","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05625923.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2091433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Management of a Fuel Cell/Supercapacitor/Battery Power Source for Electric Vehicular Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Capacitors","Voltage control","DC-DC power converters","Transient analysis","Fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","energy management systems","fuel cells","fuzzy control","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy management","fuel cell-supercapacitor-battery power source","electric vehicles","electrical hybrid power source","flatness control technique","fuzzy logic control","energy storage sources","power flow","power sharing","state of charge","real-time system controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery","dc/dc converter","electrical hybrid vehicle (EHV)","energy storage sources (ESSs)","flatness control technique (FCT) and energy management strategy (EMS)","fuel cell (FC)","fuzzy logic control (FLC)","supercapacitor (SC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management of a Fuel Cell/Supercapacitor/Battery Power Source for Electric Vehicular Applications","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5625923/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807392","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management of a Fuel Cell/Supercapacitor/Battery Power Source for Electric Vehicular Applications","sourcePdf":"tvt-zandi-2091433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091411S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5625923","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5625924,"authors":[{"name":"Dragos Bratasanu","affiliation":["Romanian Space Agency, Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/5737815/5625924/5625924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dragos Bratasanu received the M.Sc. degree in electronics and telecommunications from the University Politehnica of Bucharest UPB, Romania, in 2008 with a thesis on learning and inferring spatial structures from satellite images using visual attention models and sequential fragmentation in the scenes.

Using a recent pure-spectral rule-based fully automatic classifier to define the basic 'vocabulary', we provide a hybrid method to automatically understand and describe semantic rules that link existent mapping data according to different specifications with the end-results of unsupervised computer information mining methods. Following an agreement between the learning model and the cartographic scale implied, we exploit Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) to map heterogeneous pixels with similar intermediate-level semantic meaning into land cover classes of various mapping products. By discovering the set of rules that explain semantic classes in existent vector systems, we introduce the prototype of an interactive learning loop that uses the concept of direct semantics applied on satellite imagery. We solve a big problem in generating cartographic information layers from a fully automatic classification map and demonstrate it for the typical case of Landsat images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the Semantic Gap for Satellite Image Annotation and Automatic Mapping Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2081349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/5737815/05625924.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2081349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the Semantic Gap for Satellite Image Annotation and Automatic Mapping Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5625924/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11879171","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the Semantic Gap for Satellite Image Annotation and Automatic Mapping Applications","sourcePdf":"jstars-datcu-2081349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07755S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"5737815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5737815","articleId":"5625924","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5625928,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Manickam","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5643253/5625928/5625928-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arun Manickam received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His research interests are integrated-circuit design for biomedical applications and interface modeling.

As opposed to conventional frame-constraint vision systems, in event-driven vision there is no need for frames. In frame-free event-based vision, information is represented by a continuous flow of self-timed asynchronous events. Such events can be processed on the fly by event-based convolution chips, providing at their output a continuous event flow representing the 2-D filtered version of the input flow. In this paper we present a 32 \u00d7 32 pixel 2-D convolution event processor whose kernel can have arbitrary shape and size up to 32 \u00d7 32. Arrays of such chips can be assembled to process larger pixel arrays. Event latency between input and output event flows can be as low as 155 ns. Input event throughput can reach 20 Meps (mega events per second), and output peak event rate can reach 45 Meps. The chip can be configured to discriminate between two simulated propeller-like shapes rotating simultaneously in the field of view at a speed as high as 9400 rps (revolutions per second). Achieving this with a frame-constraint system would require a sensing and processing capability of about 100 K frames per second. The prototype chip has been built in 0.35 CMOS technology, occupies 4.3 \u00d7 5.4 and consumes a peak power of 200 mW at maximum kernel size at maximum input event rate.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2078851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"777","endPage":"790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5739679/05625930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2078851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32-32 Pixel Convolution Processor Chip for Address Event Vision Sensors With 155 ns Event Latency and 20 Meps Throughput","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Convolution","Kernel","Sensors","Retina","Synchronization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel convolution processor chip","address event vision sensors","event latency","frame-constraint vision systems","self-timed asynchronous events","2-D convolution event processor","output peak event rate","CMOS technology","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Address event representation","convolution processing","event-based processing","feature extraction","frame-less vision","neuromorphic circuits and systems","object recognition","vision processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 32<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex> </formula>32 Pixel Convolution Processor Chip for Address Event Vision Sensors With 155 ns Event Latency and 20 Meps Throughput","volume":"58","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11903650","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5625930/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625930/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex> </formula>32 Pixel Convolution Processor Chip for Address Event Vision Sensors With 155 ns Event Latency and 20 Meps Throughput","sourcePdf":"tcsi-linaresbarranco-2078851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.24921S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5739679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5739679","articleId":"5625930","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5625932,"authors":[{"name":"Donggu Im","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5625932/5625932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Donggu Im (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

By feeding the single-ended output of the voltage combiner, which is used for combining the differential output of the S-to-D converter, to the input of the LNA through the feedback network, a wideband S-to-D LNA exploiting negative feedback is implemented.

In conditions of heart abnormalities, such as valve dysfunctions and rapid blood flow, additional sounds are heard in regular heart sounds, which can be employed in pathology diagnosis. These additional sounds, or so-called murmurs, show different characteristics with respect to cardiovascular heart diseases, namely heart valve disorders. In this paper, we present a method of heart murmur classification composed by three basic steps: feature extraction, feature selection, and classification using a nonlinear classifier. A new set of 17 features extracted in the time, frequency and in the state space domain is suggested. The features applied for murmur classification are selected using the floating sequential forward method (SFFS). Using this approach, the original set of 17 features is reduced to 10 features. The classification results achieved using the proposed method are compared on a common database with the classification results obtained using the feature sets proposed in two well-known state of the art methods for murmur classification. The achieved results suggest that the proposed method achieves slightly better results using a smaller feature set.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5625940","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05625940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5625940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"4566","endPage":"4569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart murmur classification with feature selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heart murmur classification with feature selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625940/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650728","pubMedId":"21095796","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5625940/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart murmur classification with feature selection","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"11401705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079029S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5625940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5625952,"authors":[{"name":"Rajarshi Roy","affiliation":["Medical Systems (RAMS) Laboratory, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Rajarshi","lastName":"Roy","id":"38546379500"},{"name":"Wenjin Chen","affiliation":["Cancer Institute of New Jersey Informatics (CBII), New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192100"},{"name":"Lauri A.

Hence, a quantitative phenotype to automatically characterize the type and stage of cancer based upon an objective measure of its morphology and mechanical properties could provide insight regarding the changes that occur in the tissue environment during the course of disease onset and progression. In this work, we attempt to evaluate the elastic modulus of normal and cancerous human breast tissue using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which consists of a micro-cantilever that probes the sample at multiple locations to evaluate its local stiffness. We use the Hertz contact model to evaluate the elastic modulus values. Our initial findings show that cancerous specimens exhibit significantly lower elastic modulus than normal breast tissue.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Cancer","Breast tissue","Atomic force microscopy","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","biological organs","biological tissues","biomechanics","biomedical imaging","biomedical measurement","bioMEMS","cancer","cantilevers","elastic constants","elastic moduli","mammography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contact-mode atomic force microscopy","breast tissue","pathology","cancer","quantitative phenotype","microcantilever","elastic modulus","local stiffness","Hertz contact model","microarray"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5625952","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611781/5625942/05625952.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5625952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microarray-facilitated mechanical characterization of breast tissue pathology samples using contact-mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5625952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microarray-facilitated mechanical characterization of breast tissue pathology samples using contact-mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5625952/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5625952/","accessionNumber":"11660744","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microarray-facilitated mechanical characterization of breast tissue pathology samples using contact-mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)","confLoc":"Tokyo","sourcePdf":"0156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066875S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611781","isNumber":"5625942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611781","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5625942","articleId":"5625952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5625992,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Momeni","affiliation":["Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Momeni","id":"37267356100"},{"name":"Siva Yegnanarayanan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Siva","lastName":"Yegnanarayanan","id":"37317026900"},{"name":"Mohammad Soltani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","Department of Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Soltani","id":"37317026500"},{"name":"Ali A.

Traditionally, color segmentation algorithms mitigate this variability and improve performance. However, consistent and robust segmentation remains an open research problem. In this study, we avoid the tenuous phase of color segmentation by adapting a bag-of-features approach using scale invariant features for classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes. Previous work shows that features from each subtype match those from expertly chosen template images. In this paper, we show that the performance of this match-based methodology greatly depends on the quality of the template images. To avoid this uncertainty, we propose a bag-of-features approach that does not require expert knowledge and instead learns a \u201cvocabulary\u201d of morphological characteristics from training data. We build a support vector machine using feature histograms and evaluate this method using 40 iterations of 3-fold cross validation. We achieve classification accuracy above 90% for a heterogeneous dataset labeled by an expert pathologist, showing its potential for future clinical applications.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626009","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626009.pdf","startPage":"6749","endPage":"6752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes using bag-of-features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626009/","displayDocTitle":"Automated classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes using bag-of-features","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649958","pubMedId":"21095831","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626009/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes using bag-of-features","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"16831839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109223S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5626020,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this work, we take inspiration from these organisms to design, fabricate, and control a 10cm, 24 gram underactuated hexapedal robot capable of running at 14 body lengths per second and performing dynamic turning maneuvers. Our design relies on parallel kinematic mechanisms fabricated using the scaled smart composite microstructures (SCM) process and viscoelastic polymer legs with tunable stiffness. In addition to the novel robot design, we present experimental validation of the lateral leg spring (LLS) locomotion model's prediction that dynamic turning can be achieved by modulating leg stiffness. Finally, we present and validate a leg design for active stiffness control using shape memory alloy and demonstrate the ability of the robot to execute near-gymnastic 90\u00b0 turns in the span of five strides.","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5626034","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611781/5625942/05626034.pdf","startPage":"869","endPage":"876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5626034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired design and dynamic maneuverability of a minimally actuated six-legged robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626034/","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired design and dynamic maneuverability of a minimally actuated six-legged robot","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660647","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626034/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired design and dynamic maneuverability of a minimally actuated six-legged robot","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060893S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611781","isNumber":"5625942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611781","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5625942","articleId":"5626034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5626077,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37573010300"},{"name":"Leslie Ying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Leslie","lastName":"Ying","id":"37287708500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5626077","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Magnetic resonance imaging","Minimization","Compressed sensing","Dynamics","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image reconstruction","medical image processing","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing dynamic MR imaging","partially known support","dynamic MRI acquisition speed","additional prior information","CS reconstruction","time-frequency space","dynamic MR image motion pattern","truncated \u21131 minimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Dynamic MRI","Partially Known Support","Truncated \u21131 Minimization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Biomedical Engineering","Data Compression","Fourier Analysis","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Motion","Reproducibility of Results","Software","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"Compressed Sensing (CS) has recently been applied to dynamic MRI to improve the acquisition speed.

However, it is unknown whether using a lower sampling rate in EMG acquisition still preserves sufficient neural control information for accurate classification of user movement intents. This study investigated the effects of EMG sampling rate on the performance of EMG pattern recognition in identifying 11 classes of arm and hand movements. Our results showed that decreasing the sampling rate from 1 kHz to 500 Hz only caused 0.8% reduction of the average classification accuracy over five able-bodied subjects and 2.2% decrease over two transradial amputees. When using a 400 Hz sampling rate, the average classification accuracy decreased 1.3% and 2.8% in able-bodied subjects and amputees, respectively. These results suggest that a sampling rate between 400-500 Hz would be optimal for EMG acquisition in EMG pattern recognition based control of a multifunctional prosthesis.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626224","startPage":"5058","endPage":"5061","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626224.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection of sampling rate for EMG pattern recognition based prosthesis control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Selection of sampling rate for EMG pattern recognition based prosthesis control","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626224/","accessionNumber":"11660257","pubMedId":"21096026","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626224/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection of sampling rate for EMG pattern recognition based prosthesis control","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"12600190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058593S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5626225,"authors":[{"name":"Skyler A.

In the proposed fixed point custom DSP architecture, a threshold algorithm was implemented to analyze the effectiveness of Programmable Truncated Multiplication regarding power reduction while maintaining a high output accuracy. The presented system runs a real time implementation of the algorithm on a low power architecture that allows up to 23% power savings through its digital blocks when compared to a standard implementation, without any accuracy loss.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Accuracy","Accelerometers","Senior citizens","Detection algorithms","Real time systems","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","biomedical measurement","gait analysis","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","programmable circuits","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-aware real-time low-energy fall detection algorithm","power-aware real-time fall detection integrated circuit","activities of daily living","measured acceleration processing","DSP","digital signal processing","monitoring applications"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Accidental Falls","Activities of Daily Living","Adult","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Computers","Humans","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Movement","Postural Balance","Posture","Reproducibility of Results","Software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626244","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626244","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626244","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time low-energy fall detection algorithm with a Programmable Truncated MAC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time low-energy fall detection algorithm with a Programmable Truncated MAC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626244/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626244/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660456","pubMedId":"21095956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time low-energy fall detection algorithm with a Programmable Truncated MAC","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"05971300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049877S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5626247,"authors":[{"name":"Kanokwan Limnuson","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kanokwan","lastName":"Limnuson","id":"37590463600"},{"name":"Hui Lu","affiliation":["Biology Department, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Lu","id":"37593316300"},{"name":"Hillel J.

We demonstrate that initialization of the memory within the system architecture using the first recorded stimulus artifact significantly decreases system response time as compared to the case without memory initialization.

The discrete SCS prototype offers fine control over stimulation parameters such as voltage, current, pulse width, frequency, and active electrode channel via a LabVIEW graphical user interface (GUI) when connected to a PC through USB. Furthermore, the prototype utilizes a floating current sensor to provide charge-balanced biphasic stimulation and ensure safety. The stimulator was analyzed using an electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) model as well as with a pair of pacing electrodes in saline. The primary motivation of this research is to test the feasibility and functionality of a safe, effective, and power-efficient switched-capacitor based stimulator for use in Deep Brain Stimulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626290.pdf","startPage":"2927","endPage":"2930","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Switched-Capacitor based Stimulator for efficient deep-brain stimulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Capacitors","Prototypes","Switches","Graphical user interfaces","Current measurement","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","brain","electrolytes","graphical user interfaces","medical computing","neurophysiology","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep brain stimulation","4-channel prototype stimulation circuit","implantable neurological stimulators","switched-capacitor based stimulator","charge storage","charge injection","voltage-controlled stimulators","current-controlled stimulators","LabVIEW","graphical user interface","electrode-electrolyte interface model","pacing electrodes"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Graphics","Computers","Deep Brain Stimulation","Electric Capacitance","Electric Power Supplies","Electric Stimulation","Electrodes, Implanted","Electrolytes","Equipment Design","Humans","Models, Statistical","Time Factors","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Switched-Capacitor based Stimulator for efficient deep-brain stimulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650089","pubMedId":"21095987","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Switched-Capacitor based Stimulator for efficient deep-brain stimulation","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"07211969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064483S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5626401,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of the problems in detection of emboli is the identification of an embolic signal caused by very small emboli. The amplitude of the embolic signal may be so small that advanced processing methods are required to distinguish these signals from Doppler signals arising from red blood cells. In this study instead of conventional discrete wavelet transform, the Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform was used for denoising embolic signals. Performances of both approaches were compared. Unlike the conventional discrete wavelet transform discrete complex wavelet transform is a shift invariant transform with limited redundancy. Results demonstrate that the Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform based denoising outperforms conventional discrete wavelet denoising. Approximately 8 dB improvement is obtained by using the Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform compared to the improvement provided by the conventional Discrete Wavelet Transform (less than 5 dB).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising embolic Doppler ultrasound signals using Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626445","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626445.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Denoising embolic Doppler ultrasound signals using Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626445/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660059","pubMedId":"21096146","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising embolic Doppler ultrasound signals using Dual Tree Complex Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"04562114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069886S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5626464,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Fourier based approaches are typically used in these analyses, yet Fourier analysis assumes signal stationarity, which is unlikely during dynamic contractions. Wavelet based methods of signal analysis do not assume stationarity and may be more appropriate for joint time-frequency domain analysis. The purpose of this study was to compare Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) in assessing muscle fatigue in maximal constant load dynamic exercise (100% W<;;sub>max<;;/sub>). The results of this study indicate that CWT and STFT analyses give similar fatigue estimates (slope of median frequency) in maximal constant load dynamic exercise (P>0.05). However, the results of the variance was significantly lower for at least one of the muscles studied in CWT compared to STFT (P<;;0.05) indicating more variability in the EMG signal analysis using STFT. Thus, the stationarity assumption may not be the sole factor responsible for affecting the Fourier based estimates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"4622","endPage":"4625","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626474.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier and wavelet spectral analysis of EMG signals in maximal constant load dynamic exercise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5626474/","displayDocTitle":"Fourier and wavelet spectral analysis of EMG signals in maximal constant load dynamic exercise","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660459","pubMedId":"21096232","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier and wavelet spectral analysis of EMG signals in maximal constant load dynamic exercise","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"11541936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074896S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5626481,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Bartels","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Bartels","id":"37586080900"},{"name":"Li-Chen Shi","affiliation":["Center of Brain Like Computing and Machine Intelligence, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Li-Chen","lastName":"Shi","id":"37589838500"},{"name":"Bao-Liang Lu","affiliation":["Center of Brain Like Computing and Machine Intelligence, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Bao-Liang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37288124100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5626481","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Electrooculography","Electromyography","Support vector machines","Algorithm design and analysis","Brain modeling","Muscles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic artifact removal","EEG","electroencephalography","double blind source separation","support vector machine","physiological artifacts","brain-computer interface","motor imagery task","preprocessed signals"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Artifacts","Automation","Electroencephalography","Humans","Male","Movement","Muscles","Young Adult"]}],"abstract":"Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are often obscured by physiological artifacts that can render huge amounts of data useless and thus constitute a key challenge in current brain-computer interface research.

The motivation of this research is to develop a pre-processor of an automated melanoma screening system. Since NoMSLs have a wide variety of shapes and their border is often ambiguous, we developed a new tumor area extraction algorithm to account for these difficulties. We confirmed that this algorithm is capable of handling different dermoscopy images not only those of NoMSLs but also MSLs as well. We determined the tumor area from the image using this new algorithm, calculated a total 428 features from each image, and built a linear classifier. We found only two image features, \u201cthe skewness of bright region in the tumor along its major axis\u201d and \u201cthe difference between the average intensity in the peripheral part of the tumor and that in the normal skin area using the blue channel\u201d were very efficient at classifying NoMSLs and MSLs. The detection accuracy of MSLs by our classifier using only the above mentioned image feature has a sensitivity of 98.0% and a specificity of 86.6% in a set of 107 non-melanocytic and 548 melanocytic dermoscopy images using a cross-validation test.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626500","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"5407","endPage":"5410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of melanocytic skin lesions from non-melanocytic lesions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification of melanocytic skin lesions from non-melanocytic lesions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626500/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649990","pubMedId":"21096271","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5626500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of melanocytic skin lesions from non-melanocytic lesions","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"13501480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132095S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5626514,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan A.

At an early stage of the disease, AF may terminate spontaneously and is then referred to as paroxysmal AF. On the other hand, when external intervention is required for the arrhythmia to terminate, it is referred to as persistent AF. In this work, a method to discriminate between paroxysmal and persistent AF in the long-term ECGs is presented. The dominant frequency as well as the organization of the atrial activity are employed to characterize AF. The dominant atrial frequency (DAF) is estimated using hidden Markov model based frequency tracking, and organization is estimated by the sample entropy of the main atrial wave (MAW) and the first two harmonics, respectively. Long-term variations in DAF and organization from 50 ECG recordings were evaluated, showing that episodes of paroxysmal AF were consistently associated with lower DAF and organization of the MAW and the harmonics, than was persistent AF. Discrimination of paroxysmal and persistent AF resulted in classification rates of 84.1\u00b126.1%, thus suggesting that it possible to discriminate between paroxysmal and persistent AF in patients without previously known AF history.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Organizations","Harmonic analysis","Electrocardiography","Cardiology","Correlation","Rhythm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electrocardiography","entropy","hidden Markov models","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atrial fibrillation","arrhythmia","entropy","ECG","dominant atrial frequency","hidden Markov model","main atrial wave"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Aged","Algorithms","Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Fibrillation","Chronic Disease","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Entropy","Female","Humans","Longitudinal Studies","Male","Middle Aged","Reproducibility of Results","Sample Size","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626528","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626528.pdf","startPage":"4558","endPage":"4561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of frequency and sample entropy to discriminate long-term recordings of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of frequency and sample entropy to discriminate long-term recordings of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626528/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626528/","accessionNumber":"11650607","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","pubMedId":"21096222","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of frequency and sample entropy to discriminate long-term recordings of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"11381597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060458S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5626536,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa H.

The different oscillation types commonly recorded in the hippocampus are thought to correspond to several states of neural network synchronization. Therefore, accurate segmentation and decoding of these underlying states provide useful insight on the rhythms' generation. In this study we use a framework based on Hidden Markov Models, coupled with a nonlinear dynamics method based on the Lempel-Ziv estimator. The method allows us to decode and model the neural state transitions. Network synchronization was induced by acute exposure to cholinergic agonist carbachol and oscillations were recorded from the Cornu Ammonis (CA1) region of the mouse hippocampus. Our results prove that deficits in cholinergic neuro-transmission found in triple transgenic mice (3xTG, as Alzheimer's disease animal model) lead to increased instability in the hippocampal neural network synchronization.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626582","startPage":"2822","endPage":"2824","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626582.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding state transitions in hippocampal oscillatory activity in mice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Decoding state transitions in hippocampal oscillatory activity in mice","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626582/","accessionNumber":"11650109","pubMedId":"21096221","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626582/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding state transitions in hippocampal oscillatory activity in mice","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"06952112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042165S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5626584,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuyuki Saito","affiliation":["Research Center of Frontier Medical Engineering, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Saito","id":"37269733100"},{"name":"Kousuke Tsubouchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kousuke","lastName":"Tsubouchi","id":"37409671600"},{"name":"Masaharu Takahashi","affiliation":["Research Center of Frontier Medical Engineering, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37275389600"},{"name":"Koichi Ito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37278680700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5626584","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":232},"abstract":"Microwave thermal therapy is one of the modalities for cancer treatment.

It shows that they both provide the MAC basic functions though they have various differences in realization mechanism and function division.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2010.5626660","publicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609068/5625936/05626660.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2010.5626660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of MAC protocols between WiMAX and LTE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of MAC protocols between WiMAX and LTE","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651062","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626660/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of MAC protocols between WiMAX and LTE","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04329S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","isNumber":"5625936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609068","articleId":"5626660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5626675,"authors":[{"name":"Cunwu Han","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Fieldbus Technology and Automation, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cunwu Han","id":"37534954200"},{"name":"Lisha Cao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Fieldbus Technology and Automation, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lisha Cao","id":"37540152900"},{"name":"Dehui Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Fieldbus Technology and Automation, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dehui Sun","id":"37403155500"},{"name":"Zhong-ning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Zhong-ning Zhang","id":"37598583000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7970-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7969-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7967-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5626675","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","AWGN","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","code division multiple access","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","power control","radio networks","robust control","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code-division multiple access communication system","system capacity","adaptive control","least square algorithm","wireless communication system","wireless communication channel","Gaussian white noise","robust adaptive power control algorithm","extended matrix least square"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust adaptive control","CDMA system","power control","extended matrix least square"]}],"abstract":"Power control is an important research topic for code-division multiple access (CDMA) communication systems. Proper power control can increase system capacity and, especially, overcome the near-far problem effectively. Therefore, many researchers have done great works on this topic and got a lot of achievements during last decade. Adaptive control based on Least Square Algorithm is one of the commonest methods to control systems with uncertainties by estimating unknown system's parameters. However, applying the adaptive control algorithm to wireless communication systems is still a fresh topic and most of those works assumed that the wireless communication channel could be modeled by a linear system with a Gaussian white noise, which would lead to control error in the real channel environments. This paper presents a robust adaptive power control algorithm based on Extended Matrix Least Square for CDMA systems with colored noise. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance and is more effective than the fixed-step algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2010.5626675","publicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609068/5625936/05626675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2010.5626675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625936","startPage":"232","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive power control for CDMA communication systems and its simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive power control for CDMA communication systems and its simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626675/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651068","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive power control for CDMA communication systems and its simulation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043361S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","isNumber":"5625936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609068","articleId":"5626675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5626686,"authors":[{"name":"Jungsuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Jungsuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37579256100"},{"name":"Kenneth Pedrotti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Pedrotti","id":"37317670700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5626686","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":893},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","CMOS integrated circuits","Gain","Capacitors","Electrodes","Noise","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","electroencephalography","low-power electronics","neural chips","operational amplifiers","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power neural amplifier","self-biased neural amplifier","implantable EEG recording system ICs","low-power consumption","CMRR","fully differential Chappell OTA","capacitive feedback loop","input-referred noise","CMOS 4M2P process","frequency 300 Hz","gain 65.6 dB","power 1.7 muW","frequency 100 Hz","size 0.35 mum","voltage 1.2 V","voltage -1.2 V"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Amplifiers, Electronic","Electric Power Supplies","Electroencephalography","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Information Storage and Retrieval","Prostheses and Implants","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626686","abstract":"This paper presents a low-power and self-biased neural amplifier for implantable EEG recording system ICs with a high-density interface.

Real-time spike sorting, however, requires extensive computational power that is not feasible to implement in implantable BMI architectures, thereby requiring transmission of high-bandwidth raw neural data to an external computer. In this work, we describe a miniaturized, low power, programmable hardware module capable of performing this task within the resource constraints of an implantable chip. The module computes a sparse representation of the spike waveforms followed by \u201csmart\u201d thresholding. This cascade restricts the sparse representation to a subset of projections that preserve the discriminative features of neuron-specific spike waveforms. In addition, it further reduces telemetry bandwidth making it feasible to wirelessly transmit only the important biological information to the outside world, thereby improving the efficiency, practicality and viability of BMI systems in clinical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05626691.pdf","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1572","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implantable VLSI architecture for real time spike sorting in cortically controlled Brain Machine Interfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Discrete wavelet transforms","Indexes","Radiation detectors","Neurons","Hardware","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electronics","biomedical telemetry","brain","brain-computer interfaces","CMOS integrated circuits","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","prosthetics","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implantable VLSI architecture","brain machine interface","real-time spike sorting","implantable BMI architectures","neuron-specific spike waveforms","spike waveform sparse representation","telemetry bandwidth","miniaturized low power programmable hardware module","smart thresholding","cortex","implantable chip","nervous system","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Animals","Biofeedback, Psychology","Brain","Electroencephalography","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Rats","Semiconductors","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"An implantable VLSI architecture for real time spike sorting in cortically controlled Brain Machine Interfaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660072","pubMedId":"21096383","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implantable VLSI architecture for real time spike sorting in cortically controlled Brain Machine Interfaces","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"03880158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049201S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5626691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5626695,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mark","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mark","id":"37283893700"},{"name":"Toni Bj\u00f6rninen","affiliation":["Rauma Research Unit of the Electronics Department, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rninen","id":"37399814400"},{"name":"Yuhui David Chen","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuhui David","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600592400"},{"name":"Subramaniam Venkatraman","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, USA","EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Subramaniam","lastName":"Venkatraman","id":"37576205100"},{"name":"Leena Ukkonen","affiliation":["Rauma Research Unit of the Electronics Department, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Leena","lastName":"Ukkonen","id":"37265475000"},{"name":"Lauri Syd\u00e4nheimo","affiliation":["Rauma Research Unit of the Electronics Department, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Syd\u00e4nheimo","id":"37270227400"},{"name":"Jose M.

The system has been designed with the purpose of seamless integration into the National Taiwan University Health Information System. Based on the concept of .NET Service Oriented Architecture, the system integrates heterogeneous platforms, protocols, as well as applications. In this system, we add modern analytic functions such as approximated entropy and adaptive support vector machine (SVM).

Ten common carotid arteries of hypertensive men were evaluated. D was calculated by using B-mode ultrasonic imaging and specialized software designed with Artificial Neural Networks. Instantaneous arterial pressure of all subjects was measured by piezoelectric tonometry. Arterial wall properties were evaluated using a linear autoregressive with exogenous input model. The new method, which determinates the arterial diameter, was compared respect to a specialized and previously validated method. Results showed no significant differences in all parameters derived of D (Bland & Altman test) and no differences in all the wall arterial mechanic indexes (p>0.05). For these reasons, the developed software based on Artificial Neural Networks was successful in determining the parameters associated with arterial diameters and it opens up the possibility of real

activity (ANA) based on the power spectral pattern of the heart rate fluctuations (HRFs). Some attempts have been made to utilize artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify HRFs for clinical diagnoses such as ischemic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia or sleep apnea. To establish the firm bases for making such clinical diagnoses, it may be important to examine the classification accuracy for the data in physiologically well defined conditions by e.g. application of autonomic blocking agents. In this paper the three layered perceptron has been trained by the heart rate data in variety of ANS states yielded by the application of Atropine and Propranolol to 14 healthy male subjects. Six state (control, atropine and propranolol for each of the spine and upright posture) classification based on power spectrum showed average sensitivity of 67.2% and specificity 91.2%. Four state (control, atropine, propranolol and double block for either spine or upright posture) resulted in the average classification sensitivity of 75.7% and specificity 95.5%.

Slip detection plays a key role to assure an adequate adaptation of the grasping force, without object damaging. Several approaches to slip detection are currently under investigation. In particular, thermal slip sensors use a detection strategy similar to the one employed in hot wire anemometry, using a microfabricated thermal probe for detecting the convective heat flux associated to the movement of the touched object. This paper reports on the model-based optimization of a thermal slip sensor, intended for robotic prosthesis. In particular, an analytical thermal model has been developed, by merging FEM and dimensional analysis. A sensitivity analysis, performed on the parameters appearing in the model, has been performed for optimizing both sensor's geometry and materials in order to increase the heat flux and thereby to obtain a reduction of response times in the identification of slip. Simulations on the proposed design indicate an expected increase of the thermal dissipated power of about 400%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a thermal slip sensor using FEM and dimensional analysis","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5626757","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611781/5625942/05626757.pdf","startPage":"855","endPage":"860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5626757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a thermal slip sensor using FEM and dimensional analysis","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626757/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660674","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a thermal slip sensor using FEM and dimensional analysis","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"0197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089367S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611781","isNumber":"5625942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611781","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5625942","articleId":"5626757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5626778,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The prototype, in scale 1 : 2 with respect to the average dimensions of an adult human, is based on two storage elements, which are responsible for the energetic coupling between the knee and ankle joints during the swing phase and for the energy storage during the stance phase.

In this paper, we apply a combination of feature selection algorithm and neural network classifier in order to recognize five types of white blood cells in the peripheral blood. For this purpose, first nucleus and cytoplasm are segmented using Gram-Schmidt method and snake algorithm, respectively; second, three kinds of features are extracted from the segmented areas. Then the best features are selected using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, five types of white blood cells are classified using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network. The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is validated by an expert's classification results. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by comparing our results with those reported in a recent article which proposed a method based on the combination of Sequential Forward

binary-weights neural network for robot control","abstract":"We propose a pure topological recurrent networks controller, which has random binary connections in hidden layer, and all hidden neurons are activated by sinusoidal functions. A direct graph encoding method and four genetic operators are implemented for using genetic programming to train this controller. Firstly, its feasibility and efficiency were validated by a pair of function approximation experiments, the results show that through evolutionary learning, this novel RNN controller can handle nonlinear problems as well as common RNN even without adjustable weights. Moreover, a simulated mobile robot was equipped with this controller, and the robot was navigated around obstacles toward a goal in physical simulation environments; during tests, this robot exhibited four successful behaviors just by topological evolving on the simple controller. This experiment reveals that this controller has the simplicity, usability and potential for robot control, it then raises the hope for further works in exploring network motifs from high level controllers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626893/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11660676","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5626893/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The binary-weights neural network for robot control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The binary-weights neural network for robot control","confLoc":"Tokyo","sourcePdf":"0070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070473S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611781","isNumber":"5625942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611781","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5625942","articleId":"5626893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5626898,"authors":[{"name":"Yonggang Wang","affiliation":["System Engineer Institute, Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Yonggang Wang","id":"37087741833"},{"name":"Zhuren Feng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Zhuren Feng","id":"37088330050"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["Laboratory ofIntelligent Information Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Licheng Jiao","id":"37086741706"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7970-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7969-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7967-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5626898","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626898","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cloning","Radio access networks","Signal to noise ratio","Multiaccess communication","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","evolutionary computation","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immune clone selection algorithm","multiuser detection","evolutionary algorithms","ICSA multiuser detector","multistage detector","ICSA-MSD-MUD","ICSA algorithm","hybrid detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Immune clone selection algorithm","Mutiuser Detection"]}],"abstract":"Immune clone selection algorithm (ICSA) and the multi-user detection based on ICSA are studied. Similar to evolutionary algorithms, ICSA is an efficient tool in searching for the global optimum based on the representation of solutions as binary code. It shows better potential capability to solve the optimization problem than evolution algorithm. Two novel multi-user detectors are presented which are basic ICSA multi-user detector and hybrid ICSA multi-user detector with multi-stage detector (ICSA-MSD-MUD). For ICSA-MSD-MUD, the MSD is considered as an operator inside the ICSA algorithm. The hybrid detector can reach excellent performance by utilizing ICSA to implement global search and by utilizing MSD to implement local search.

Under heterogeneous networks, a mobile station can transmit over multiple and simultaneous radio access technologies (RATs) such as WLAN, HSPA, and WCDMA LTE. Also, cognitive radio for the efficient use of underutilized/unused frequency band is successfully implemented in some networks. In this letter, we address such operational issues as air interface and band selection for a mobile and power allocation to the chosen links. An optimal solution is sought and analyzed and a distributed joint allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize total system capacity. We investigate the benefit of multiple transmissions by multiple RATs over a single transmission by a single RAT at a time, which can be interpreted as network diversity. Numerical results validate the performance enhancement of our proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation for Parallel Multi-Radio Access in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.11.100045","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05626933.pdf","startPage":"3324","endPage":"3329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.11.100045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation for Parallel Multi-Radio Access in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5626933/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Allocation for Parallel Multi-Radio Access in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"3324-tw1011-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082572S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5626933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5626934,"authors":[{"name":"Taejoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5626934/5626934-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taejoon Kim (S'08) received the B.S. degree (with highest honors) in electrical engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2004.

A limited feedback beamforming technique is proposed for dual-polarized MIMO channels where the receiver has perfect channel knowledge but the transmitter only receives partial information regarding the channel instantiation. The system employs an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distortion minimizing codebook to convey channel state information (CSI) in the form of beamforming direction. By investigating the average SNR performance of this system, an upper bound on the average SNR distortion is found as a weighted sum of two beamforming distortion metrics. The distortion minimization problem is solved by designing a concatenated codebook. Finally, we propose a codebook switching scheme exploiting the cross-polar discrimination (XPD) statistics. Simulations show that the proposed codebook switching scheme with an XPD dependent concatenated codebook has the ability to adapt to dual-polarized channels.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.09.090754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05626934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.09.090754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","startPage":"3425","endPage":"3439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5626934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5626934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638091","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5626934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"3425-tw1011-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.246761S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5626934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5626952,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Zhiqiang Zhou","id":"37404366000"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Shaoqian Li","id":"37279617000"},{"name":"Yufan Cheng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Yufan Cheng","id":"37405372500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7970-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7969-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7967-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5626952","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hop communication","jamming","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband energy detection","partial-band interference","FFH systems","fast frequency hopped spread spectrum system","partial-band jamming","threshold configuration method","signal plus noise ratio","wideband receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency hopping","Partial-band jamming","Interference detection"]}],"abstract":"A fast frequency hopped spread spectrum system is described which employs a wideband receiver to detect partial-band jamming.

An intelligent infrared surveillance system is aimed to provide real-time intelligent analysis of the perceived scene and find out human targets instantly to assist the soldier/commanders to make the right decision in a just-in-time mode to save our soldiers from life risks. To attain this, automatic detection of moving human objects from the scene is an essential step. In this paper, we present an FPGAs-based architecture to perform on-chip human silhouette extraction using a parallel architecture with systolic arrays. The architecture is designed in VHDL and simulated with real FLIR videos. The experiment shows that the designed processor on FPGAs can efficiently extract the human contour instantly from infrared videos, which exhibits great potential to facilitate the further analysis of the battlefield scenes for military-purpose surveillance systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Random access memory","Image resolution","Cameras","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","military computing","night vision","object detection","security","systolic arrays","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","infrared night vision military surveillance","infrared visual surveillance","secure military camp","soldier security","suspected terror activity detection","battle field","intelligent infrared surveillance system","moving human object detection","automatic detection","target detection","on-chip human silhouette extraction","parallel architecture","systolic arrays","VHDL","real FLIR video","human contour extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Infrared imaging","military surveillance","human silhouette","salient object detection","VLSI architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627025","doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2010.5627025","startPage":"63","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609068/5626590/05627025.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2010.5627025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627025/","displayDocTitle":"Human silhouette extraction on FPGAs for infrared night vision military surveillance","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","volume":"1","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11651195","htmlLink":"/document/5627025/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human silhouette extraction on FPGAs for infrared night vision military surveillance","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054469S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609068","isNumber":"5626590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609068","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5626590","articleId":"5627025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5627046,"authors":[{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Song Liu","id":"37087162134"},{"name":"Xuemiao Pang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Xuemiao Pang","id":"37088282091"},{"name":"Haiyan Ji","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Ji","id":"37087180992"},{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Hao Chen","id":"37087149038"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7970-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7969-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7967-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5627046","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","neural nets","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["track irregularities","vehicle body","Adams software","series-parallel NARX neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["track irregularities","inverse system","NARX neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627046","abstract":"The paper proposes an approach to predict track irregularities based on accelerations of vehicle body using neural network.

The decimation factor of the proposed digital channelized receiver with low calculation cost is equal to the number of signal channels, which is acquired by changing the input signal of the embedded instantaneous frequency measurement receiver. Due to the increase of the system decimation factor, the data to be processed are decreased and the system processing speed is improved indirectly. In this paper, the architecture and working principle of the proposed digital channelized receiver with low calculation cost is firstly given; secondly, the overlapping channel division method used in the digital channelized receiver with low calculation cost is put forward. Meanwhile, the channel arbitration method of the unmodulated or modulated signal in the case of overlapping channel division is analyzed. Then, the frequency measurement principle of the embedded instantaneous frequency measurement receiver is deduced in detail. Through the use of the overlapping channel division method, the proposed digital channelized receiver with low calculation cost is able to avoid the existence of blind spots between channels and increases the interception probabilities of the input signals. And, the proposed digital channelized receiver can distinguish two signals coming simultaneously to the same channel by using the overlapping channel division method. In addition, the channel of the input signal truly residing can be simply determined by using the channel arbitration in the case of overlapping channel division and according to the output frequency of the embedded instantaneous frequency measurement receiver. Finally, the related simulation results verify the correctness and feasibility of the theories and method involved in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627076/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651168","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A digital channelized receiver architecture with low calculation cost","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital channelized receiver architecture with low calculation cost","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045728S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609068","isNumber":"5626590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609068","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5626590","articleId":"5627076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5627119,"authors":[{"name":"Amir M.

This is in order to guarantee that complete signal recovery is later on possible. The sampled signal can subsequently be subjected to further processing leading to, for example, encryption and compression. This processing can be computationally intensive and, in the case of battery operated systems, unpractically power hungry. Compressive sensing has recently emerged as a new signal sampling paradigm gaining huge attention from the research community. According to this theory it can potentially be possible to sample certain signals at a lower than Nyquist rate without jeopardizing signal recovery. In practical terms this may provide multi-pronged solutions to reduce some systems computational complexity. In this work, information theoretic analysis of real EEG signals is presented that shows the additional benefits of compressive sensing in preserving data privacy. Through this it can then be established generally that compressive sensing not only compresses but also secures while sampling.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627119","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing: From \u201cCompressing while Sampling\u201d to \u201cCompressing and Securing while Sampling\u201d","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing: From \u201cCompressing while Sampling\u201d to \u201cCompressing and Securing while Sampling\u201d","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627119/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650797","pubMedId":"21096322","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing: From \u201cCompressing while Sampling\u201d to \u201cCompressing and Securing while Sampling\u201d","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"02790393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051999S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627125,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chen Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li-Chen","lastName":"Shi","id":"37589838500"},{"name":"Bao-Liang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bao-Liang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37288124100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627125","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Brain modeling","Indexes","Estimation","Manifolds","Delta modulation","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","occupational health"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off line vigilance estimation","on line vigilance estimation","linear dynamical system","manifold learning","human-machine interaction systems","continuous operator vigilance estimation","electroencephalogram","EEG spatial information","vigilance change temporal information"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Arousal","Electroencephalography","Female","Humans","Male","Man-Machine Systems","Models, Theoretical","Young Adult"]}],"abstract":"For many human machine interaction systems, to ensure work safety, the techniques for continuously estimating the vigilance of operators are highly desirable. Up to now, various methods based on electroencephalogram (EEG) are proposed to solve this problem. However, most of them are static methods and are based on supervised learning strategy. The main deficiencies of the existing methods are that the label information is hard to get and the time dependency of vigilance changes are ignored. In this paper, we introduce the dynamic characteristics of vigilance changes into vigilance estimation and propose a novel model based on linear dynamical system and manifold learning techniques to implement off-line and online vigilance estimation. In this model, both spatial information of EEG and temporal information of vigilance changes are used. The label information what we need is merely to know which EEG indices are important for vigilance estimation. Experimental results show that the mean off-line and on-line correlation coefficients between estimated vigilance level and local error rate in second-scale without being averaged are 0.89 and 0.83, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-line and on-line vigilance estimation based on linear dynamical system and manifold learning","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627125","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627125.pdf","startPage":"6587","endPage":"6590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Off-line and on-line vigilance estimation based on linear dynamical system and manifold learning","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627125/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650803","pubMedId":"21096513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-line and on-line vigilance estimation based on linear dynamical system and manifold learning","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"16430682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061878S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5627135,"authors":[{"name":"Ren Hui Gong","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ren Hui","lastName":"Gong","id":"37424648200"},{"name":"James Stewart","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Stewart","id":"37591698700"},{"name":"Purang Abolmaesumi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Purang","lastName":"Abolmaesumi","id":"37283403700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627135","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spline","Lattices","Training","Approximation methods","Graphics processing unit","Geometry","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","computerised tomography","image registration","image representation","medical image processing","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal representation","intensity atlas","GPU-accelerated instance generation","fast instance generation","atlas-based registration","B-spline deformation lattices","multilevel B-spline approximation","model creation","parallel computation","graphics processing units","distal radius CT","computed tomography","coefficients-to-voxels ratio","GeForce GTX 285 video card"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Humans","Models, Anatomic","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Subtraction Technique","Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Wrist","Wrist"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627135","abstract":"Fast instance generation is a key requirement in atlas-based registration and other problems that need a large number of atlas instances.

Experiments with distal radius CTs show that, with a coefficients-to-voxels ratio of 0.16, intensities can be approximated up to an average accuracy of 2 \u00b1 17 grey-levels (out of 3072 total grey-levels), and instances of resolution 256\u00d7256\u00d7200 can be produced in a rate of 25 instances per second with a GeForce GTX 285 video card, which is about 500 times performance improvement over the traditional method that uses plain CPU.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627135","startPage":"4399","endPage":"4402","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627135.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new representation of intensity atlas for GPU-accelerated instance generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new representation of intensity atlas for GPU-accelerated instance generation","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627135/","accessionNumber":"11650967","pubMedId":"21096459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627135/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new representation of intensity atlas for GPU-accelerated instance generation","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"10991616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066962S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627158,"authors":[{"name":"Sajad Farashi","affiliation":["Biomedical engineering of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"],"firstName":"Sajad","lastName":"Farashi","id":"37601621500"},{"name":"Mohammad D.

The principal component analysis (PCA) is a convenient tool for clustering spikes; however it has some disadvantages for closely shaped and overlapped spikes. For such the cases, an algorithm based on the combination of the principal component analysis and undecimated wavelet transform, is proposed to enhance the cluster formation from the spikes mapping. These results indicate that the principal component analysis used in combination with the undecimated wavelet has a better performance in the spike sorting. This can lead to more compact and separate clusters in comparison with the PCA clustering and more efficient spike sorting.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627158","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627158.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"6666","endPage":"6669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combination of PCA and undecimated wavelet transform for neural data processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combination of PCA and undecimated wavelet transform for neural data processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627158/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660100","pubMedId":"21096738","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination of PCA and undecimated wavelet transform for neural data processing","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"16621750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056353S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5627165,"authors":[{"name":"Joubin Nasehi Tehrani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Joubin","lastName":"Nasehi Tehrani","id":"37601653800"},{"name":"Craig Jin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Jin","id":"37365923500"},{"name":"Alistair McEwan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Alistair","lastName":"McEwan","id":"37269466900"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 van Schaik","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"van Schaik","id":"37269982000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627165","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1035},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Impedance","Compressed sensing","Finite element methods","Noise","TV","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical MRI","data compression","electric impedance imaging","image reconstruction","iterative methods","least squares approximations","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing algorithms","electrical impedance tomography","internal conductivity distribution","electrical contact measurements","EIT reconstruction","least squares error","Euclidian","L2-norm","magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical MRI","L1-norm regularization","Lagrangian multiplier method","two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding method","TWIST","L0-regularized least squares problem","least absolute shrinkage and selection operator","LASSO","Pareto curve","total variation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Cardiography, Impedance","Computer Simulation","Data Compression","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Humans","Models, Biological","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) calculates the internal conductivity distribution within a body using electrical contact measurements. Conventional EIT reconstruction methods solve a linear model by minimizing the least squares error, i.e., the Euclidian or L2-norm, with regularization. Compressed sensing provides unique advantages in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) when the images are transformed to a sparse basis. EIT images are generally sparser than MRI images due to their lower spatial resolution. This leads us to investigate ability of compressed sensing algorithms currently applied to MRI in EIT without transformation to a new basis. In particular, we examine four new iterative algorithms for L1 and L0 minimization with applications to compressed sensing and compare these with current EIT inverse L1-norm regularization methods. The four compressed sensing methods are as follows: (1) an interior point method for solving L1-regularized least squares problems (L1-LS); (2) total variation using a Lagrangian multiplier method (TVAL3); (3) a two-step iterative shrinkage / thresholding method (TWIST) for solving the L0-regularized least squares problem; (4) The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with tracing the Pareto curve, which estimates the least squares parameters subject to a L1-norm constraint. In our investigation, using 1600 elements, we found all four CS algorithms provided an improvement over the best conventional EIT reconstruction method, Total Variation, in three important areas: robustness to noise, increased computational speed of at least 40x and a visually apparent improvement in spatial resolution. Out of the four CS algorithms we found TWIST was the fastest with at least a 100x speed increase.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between compressed sensing algorithms in Electrical Impedance Tomography","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627165","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627165.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between compressed sensing algorithms in Electrical Impedance Tomography","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627165/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660107","pubMedId":"21096588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between compressed sensing algorithms in Electrical Impedance Tomography","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"07670273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141515S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627178,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Tavella","affiliation":["Chair on Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Tavella","id":"37593933700"},{"name":"Robert Leeb","affiliation":["Chair on Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Leeb","id":"37424802800"},{"name":"R\u00fcdiger Rupp","affiliation":["University Hospital, Spinal Cord Injury Center, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"R\u00fcdiger","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37411966500"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 del R.

Our neuroprosthetic approach relies on a natural interaction paradigm, where subjects delivers congruent MI commands (i.e., they imagining a movement of the same hand they control through FES). Furthermore, we have tested our approach in a common daily task such as handwriting, which requires the user to split his/her attention to multitask between BCI control, reaching, and the primary handwriting task itself. Interestingly, the very low number of erroneous trials illustrates how during the experiments subjects were able to deliver commands just when they intended to do so. Similarly, the subjects could perform actions while delivering, or preparing to deliver, mental commands.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627178","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"126","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards natural non-invasive hand neuroprostheses for daily living","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards natural non-invasive hand neuroprostheses for daily living","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627178/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650667","pubMedId":"21096523","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627178/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards natural non-invasive hand neuroprostheses for daily living","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"00311629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100846S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627189,"authors":[{"name":"Jieru Chi","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jieru","lastName":"Chi","id":"37409527100"},{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275918700"},{"name":"Ling Xia","affiliation":["Department of biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Xia","id":"37364665800"},{"name":"Tingting Shao","affiliation":["Department of biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Shao","id":"37595281100"},{"name":"David G.

This is essential for use in wearable, long term physiological monitoring systems. Present analogue CWT implementations rely on taking mathematical a approximation of the wanted mother wavelet function to give a filter transfer function that is suitable for circuit implementation. This paper investigates the use of standard filter approximations (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel) as an alternative wavelet approximation technique. This extends the number of approximation techniques available for generating analogue CWT filters. An example ECG analysis shows that signal information can be successfully extracted using these CWT approximations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standard filter approximations for low power Continuous Wavelet Transforms","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627245","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627245.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Standard filter approximations for low power Continuous Wavelet Transforms","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627245/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650681","pubMedId":"21096545","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standard filter approximations for low power Continuous Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"01600379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09492S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627278,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086494200"},{"name":"Dong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37573010300"},{"name":"Kevin F.

These weights are usually derived from auto-calibration signal (ACS) lines that are acquired in parallel to the reduced lines. In this paper, a cross sampling method is proposed to acquire the ACS lines orthogonal to the reduced lines. This cross sampling method increases the amount of calibration data along the direction that the k-space is undersampled and thus improves the calibration accuracy, especially when a small number of ACS lines are acquired. Both phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, named cross-sampled GRAPPA (CS-GRAPPA), can effectively reduce the aliasing artifacts of GRAPPA when high acceleration is desired.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Coils","Calibration","Phantoms","Fourier transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","calibration","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross sampled GRAPPA","parallel MRI","parallel imaging method","Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions","GRAPPA technique","missing k-space data reconstruction","acquired data linear combination","autocalibration signal","calibration accuracy","CS-GRAPPA"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Brain","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Reproducibility of Results","Sample Size","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627278","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627278.pdf","startPage":"3325","endPage":"3328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-sampled GRAPPA for parallel MRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-sampled GRAPPA for parallel MRI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627278/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627278/","accessionNumber":"11651002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","pubMedId":"21096619","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-sampled GRAPPA for parallel MRI","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"08201735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062192S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5627288,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Kaufmann","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Kaufmann","id":"37592615200"},{"name":"Kevin Englehart","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Englehart","id":"37283263100"},{"name":"Marco Platzner","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Platzner","id":"37265525900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627288","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the behavior of state-of-the-art pattern matching algorithms when applied to electromyographic data recorded during 21 days.

Using MEG to reconstruct the neural activity of interest is challenging because of interference to the signal from the DBS device. We demonstrate that a null-beamformer can be used to localise neural activity despite artefacts caused by the presence of DBS electrodes and stimulus pulses. We subsequently verified the accuracy of our source localisation by correlating the predicted DBS electrode positions with their actual positions, previously identified using anatomical imaging.

Symbolic learning applied to our skin lesion data seems to outperform other classical machine learning methods, and is more comprehensive both in understanding, and in application of further improvements.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627337","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"4104","endPage":"4107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic learning supporting early diagnosis of melanoma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic learning supporting early diagnosis of melanoma","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627337/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650701","pubMedId":"21096628","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627337/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic learning supporting early diagnosis of melanoma","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"10260454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073229S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627368,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Missouri, USA"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086683628"},{"name":"Zhiling Zeng","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Missouri, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiling","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37088310673"},{"name":"Mihail Popescu","affiliation":["Health Mngmt. & Information Department, University of Missouri, Colombus, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Mihail","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37271590600"},{"name":"K.C.

It is reported that more than one third of adults 65 and older fall each year in the United States. To address the problem, we are currently developing an acoustic fall detection system, FADE, which automatically detects a fall and reports it to the caregiver. In a previous version, FADE used a 3-microphone linear array to eliminate the false alarms produced by sounds produced well above the floor level. To improve the fall detection in noisy and reverberant environments, we replaced the linear array by an 8-microphone circular array that can provide a better 3-D estimation of the sound location. Preliminary experiments show that the sound location estimation performed by the circular array is reliable and robust to interference. We obtained encouraging classification results on a pilot dataset with 55 falls and 120 non-fall sounds.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627368","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627368.pdf","startPage":"2242","endPage":"2245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic fall detection using a circular microphone array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627368/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic fall detection using a circular microphone array","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11659973","pubMedId":"21096795","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627368/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic fall detection using a circular microphone array","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"05530417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079783S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627392,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Rangan","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Rangan","id":"38179899400"},{"name":"Abhishek Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37598048600"},{"name":"Vladimir Aparin","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Aparin","id":"37268464200"},{"name":"Gert Cauwenberghs","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Jacobs School of Engineering and the Institute of Neural Computation, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gert","lastName":"Cauwenberghs","id":"37270866000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627392","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":910},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Mathematical model","Biomembranes","Equations","Integrated circuit modeling","Transistors","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","equivalent circuits","man-machine systems","MOSFET","neural nets","physiological models","prosthetics","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aVLSI","Izhikevich simple neuron model","neuron spiking","bursting dynamics","log-domain circuit design","MOS transistors","human-machine interface","neural prostheses","implantable bioelectronics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Models, Biological","Neurons"]}],"abstract":"We present a circuit architecture for compact analog VLSI implementation of the Izhikevich neuron model, which efficiently describes a wide variety of neuron spiking and bursting dynamics using two state variables and four adjustable parameters.

Drawing from emerging theory on sampling FRI signals, our process aims to acquire the precise shape and timing of spikes from electrodes with single or multiunit spiking activity using sampling rates of 1000 Hz or less. The key insight is that action potentials are essentially stereotyped pulses that are generated by neurons at a rate limited by an absolute refractory period. We use this insight to push sampling below the Nyquist rate. Our process is a parametric method distinct from compressed sensing (CS). In its full implementation, this process could improve spike-based devices for neuroscience and medicine by reducing energy consumption, computational complexity, and hardware demands.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Neurons","Brain modeling","Shape","Trajectory","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","Nyquist criterion","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite innovation rate","action potentials","ultralow sampling rates","electrodes","multiunit spiking activity","compressed sensing","signal sampling","absolute refractory period","Nyquist rate","neurons"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Electrodes","Humans","Neurons","Oximetry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627399","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627399.pdf","startPage":"4213","endPage":"4216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of action potentials with ultra-low sampling rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of action potentials with ultra-low sampling rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627399/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627399/","accessionNumber":"11660162","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","pubMedId":"21096896","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of action potentials with ultra-low sampling rates","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"10530459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056839S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5627436,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where scan duration is directly proportional to the number of acquired samples, CS has the potential to dramatically decrease scan time. However, the computationally expensive nature of CS reconstructions has so far precluded their use in routine clinical practice - instead, more-easily generated but lower-quality images continue to be used. We investigate the development and optimization of a proven inexact quasi-Newton CS reconstruction algorithm on several modern parallel architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and Intel's Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture. Our (optimized) baseline implementation on a quad-core Core i7 is able to reconstruct a 256\u00d7160\u00d780 volume of the neurovasculature from an 8-channel, 10\u00d7 undersampled data set within 56 seconds, which is already a significant improvement over existing implementations. The latest six-core Core i7 reduces the reconstruction time further to 32 seconds. Moreover, we show that the CS algorithm benefits from modern throughput-oriented architectures. Specifically, our CUDA-base implementation on NVIDIA GTX480 reconstructs the same dataset in 16 seconds, while Intel's Knights Ferry (KNF) of the MIC architecture even reduces the time to 12 seconds. Such level of performance allows the neurovascular dataset to be reconstructed within a clinically viable time.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627493","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627493.pdf","startPage":"3321","endPage":"3324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance 3D Compressive Sensing MRI reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-performance 3D Compressive Sensing MRI reconstruction","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627493/","accessionNumber":"11660180","pubMedId":"21096822","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance 3D Compressive Sensing MRI reconstruction","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"08191003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049847S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5627497,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The large computational power often required, however, has been a limiting factor for its applications. In this paper, we will present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel FDTD solver and its successful application to the investigation of a novel B1 shimming scheme for high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The optimized shimming scheme exhibits considerably improved transmit B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n profiles. The GPU implementation dramatically shortened the runtime of FDTD simulation of electromagnetic field compared with its CPU counterpart. The acceleration in runtime has made such investigation possible, and will pave the way for other studies of large-scale computational electromagnetic problems in modern MRI which were previously impractical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated FDTD solver and its application in MRI","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627497","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627497.pdf","startPage":"3305","endPage":"3308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated FDTD solver and its application in MRI","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627497/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660320","pubMedId":"21096818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated FDTD solver and its application in MRI","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"08150495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056194S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627523,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In these cases, a mean absolute error of 17 ms for the inter-beat interval lengths has been achieved, over a test corpus of 20 whole nights.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627626/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660019","pubMedId":"21097094","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heart rate estimation on a beat-to-beat basis via ballistocardiography - a hybrid approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart rate estimation on a beat-to-beat basis via ballistocardiography - a hybrid approach","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"10120042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070081S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5627627,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Arizmendi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Languages and Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Computer Languages and Systems at Technical, University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Arizmendi","id":"37601526800"},{"name":"Juan Hern\u00e1ndez-Tamames","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Tamames","id":"38277824900"},{"name":"Enrique Romero","affiliation":["Department of Computer Languages and Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Computer Languages and Systems at Technical, University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Romero","id":"37285935200"},{"name":"Alfredo Vellido","affiliation":["Department of Computer Languages and Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Computer Languages and Systems at Technical, University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Vellido","id":"37372436900"},{"name":"Francisco del Pozo","affiliation":["Biomedical Technology Center at Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"del Pozo","id":"37272307400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627627","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627627","abstract":"The diagnosis of human brain tumours from noninvasive signal measurements is a sensitive task that requires specialized expertise.

A large portion of the literature focuses on offline classification accuracy of pre-recorded signals. Historically, however, there has been a semantic gap between research findings and a clinically viable implementation. Recently, renewed focus on prosthetics research has pushed the field to provide more clinically relevant outcomes. One way to work towards this goal is to examine the differences between research and clinical results. The constrained nature in which offline training and test data is often collected compared to the dynamic nature of prosthetic use is just one example. In this work, we demonstrate that variations in limb position after training can have a substantial impact on the robustness of myoelectric pattern recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627638","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627638.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627638","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","startPage":"6337","endPage":"6340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Examining the adverse effects of limb position on pattern recognition based myoelectric control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Examining the adverse effects of limb position on pattern recognition based myoelectric control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627638/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660200","pubMedId":"21097173","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examining the adverse effects of limb position on pattern recognition based myoelectric control","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"15810897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05625S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5627645,"authors":[{"name":"Can Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade do Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Ye","id":"37597374500"},{"name":"Miguel Tavares Coimbra","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade do Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel Tavares","lastName":"Coimbra","id":"37283426200"},{"name":"B.V.K.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for arrhythmia classification based on a combination of morphological and dynamic features. Wavelet Transform (WT) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are applied separately to each heartbeat to extract corresponding coefficients, which are categorized as `morphological' features. In addition, RR interval information is also obtained characterizing the `rhythm' around the corresponding heartbeat providing `dynamic' features. These two different types of features are then concatenated and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for the classification of heartbeats into 15 classes. The procedure is applied to the data from two ECG leads independently and the two results are fused for the final decision. Compare the two classification results and the classification result is kept if the two are identical or the one with greater classification confidence is picked up if the two are inconsistent. The proposed method was tested over the entire MIT-BIH Arrhythmias Database and it yields an overall accuracy of 99.66% on 85945 heartbeats, better than any other published results.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627645","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","startPage":"1918","endPage":"1921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arrhythmia detection and classification using morphological and dynamic features of ECG signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Arrhythmia detection and classification using morphological and dynamic features of ECG signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660207","pubMedId":"21097000","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5627645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arrhythmia detection and classification using morphological and dynamic features of ECG signals","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"04750109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041494S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5627705,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoaki Nagaoka","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Group, Applied Electromagnetic Research Center, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Nagaoka","id":"37410938000"},{"name":"Soichi Watanabe","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Group, Applied Electromagnetic Research Center, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Soichi","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280301300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5627705","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":620},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Finite difference methods","Kernel","Time domain analysis","Instruction sets","Numerical models","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical engineering","electromagnetic wave absorption","finite difference time-domain analysis","general purpose computers","medical signal processing","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU","graphics processing unit","three-dimensional FDTD","finite difference time domain","electromagnetic field analysis","biomedical engineering","general purpose programming","Compute Unified Device Architecture","CUDA","NVIDIA Tesla C1060","vector supercomputer","thread block size"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Child, Preschool","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Computers","Electromagnetic Fields","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Anatomic"]}],"abstract":"Numerical simulations with the numerical human model using the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method have recently been performed frequently in a number of fields in biomedical engineering.

Reliable energy harvesting has now become a reality for machine condition monitoring and is finding applications in chemical process plants, refineries and water treatment works. However, practical miniature devices that can harvest sufficient energy from the human body to power a wireless bio-sensor are still in their infancy. This paper reviews the options for human energy harvesting in order to determine power availability for harvester-powered body sensor networks. The main competing technologies for energy harvesting from the human body are inertial kinetic energy harvesting devices and thermoelectric devices. These devices are advantageous to some other types as they can be hermetically sealed. In this paper the fundamental limit to the power output of these devices is compared as a function of generator volume when attached to a human whilst walking and running. It is shown that the kinetic energy devices have the highest fundamental power limits in both cases. However, when a comparison is made between the devices using device effectivenesses figures from previously demonstrated prototypes presented in the literature, the thermal device is competitive with the kinetic energy harvesting device when the subject is running and achieves the highest power density when the subject is walking.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627952","publicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608545/5625939/05627952.pdf","startPage":"3432","endPage":"3436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5627952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy harvesting for human wearable and implantable bio-sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy harvesting for human wearable and implantable bio-sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627952/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11650088","pubMedId":"21097254","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy harvesting for human wearable and implantable bio-sensors","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"08482153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036546S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5627952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5627985,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Azimian","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada","Lawson Health Research Institute, Canadian Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Azimian","id":"37542769800"},{"name":"Rajni V.

The governing equations of trocar kinematics are derived and the constrained manipulation is generically formulated in terms of the trocar geometry as well as the kinematics of the manipulator. The results are validated through a numerical simulation with a Mitsubishi PA10-7C arm. Following this analysis, by utilizing the constrained manipulation formulation, a modified measure of manipulability, specifically applicable to surgical tasks, is proposed. The measure is proven to be frame-invariant and dimensionally homogeneous for manipulators with similar joints (revolute or prismatic). Furthermore, the measure is shown to be capable of quantifying the impact of trocar constraints on surgical task performance when the remote center of motion is maintained through active compliant motion control.","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5627985","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","startPage":"650","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5627985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625942","pdfPath":"/iel5/5611781/5625942/05627985.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Manipulators","Jacobian matrices","Kinematics","Joints","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","numerical analysis","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery","trocar kinematics","Mitsubishi PA10-7C arm","constrained manipulation formulation","surgical tasks","trocar constraints","remote center of motion","active compliant motion control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On constrained manipulation in robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5627985/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5627985/","accessionNumber":"11660652","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On constrained manipulation in robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"0126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052094S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5611781","isNumber":"5625942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5611781","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5625942","articleId":"5627985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5628038,"authors":[{"name":"Luis C.

These coefficients, which are comprised in a small cubic neighborhood located at the first octant of a 3D Fourier space (including the DC component), are then fed into six NN during the learning stage. Each NN yields the estimates of a registration parameter. The proposed method was assessed for 3D rigid-body transformations, using DC neighborhoods of different sizes. The mean absolute registration errors are of approximately 0.030 mm in translations and 0.030 deg in rotations, for the typical motion amplitudes encountered in FMRI studies. The construction of the training set and the learning stage are fast requiring, respectively, 90 s and 1 to 12 s, depending on the number of input and hidden units of the NN. We believe that NN-based approaches to the problem of FMRI registration can be of great interest in the future. For instance, NN relying on limited K-space data (possibly in navigation echoes) can be a valid solution to the problem of prospective (in frame) FMRI registration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628038/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11650555","pubMedId":"21097303","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628038/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FMRI 3D registration based on Fourier space subsets using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FMRI 3D registration based on Fourier space subsets using neural networks","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"14041373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094686S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5628038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5628061,"authors":[{"name":"Charalampos Doukas","affiliation":["University of Aegean, Samos, Greece"],"firstName":"Charalampos","lastName":"Doukas","id":"37568936200"},{"name":"Thomas Pliakas","affiliation":["COO Converged Core, Nokia Siemens Networks, Inc., Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Pliakas","id":"37568935500"},{"name":"Ilias Maglogiannis","affiliation":["University of Central Greece, Lamia, Greece"],"firstName":"Ilias","lastName":"Maglogiannis","id":"37296439500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4123-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4124-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5628061","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":163,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":6930},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Medical information systems","Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information services","medical information systems","mobile communication","operating systems (computers)","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile healthcare information management","cloud computing","Android OS","electronic healthcare data storage","patient health records","medical images","DICOM format","JPEG2000 coding","Amazon S3 cloud service"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cellular Phone","Computer Communication Networks","Database Management Systems","Greece","Health Records, Personal","Programming Languages","Radiology Information Systems","Telemedicine","User-Computer Interface"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing provides functionality for managing information data in a distributed, ubiquitous and pervasive manner supporting several platforms, systems and applications.

Compared to other algorithms this new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis and is designed to cope with arrhythmias. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in laboratory and home settings for its agreement with an ECG reference. A beat-to-beat interval error of 14.16 ms with a coverage of 96.87% was achieved. Averaged over 10 s long epochs, the mean heart rate error was 0.39 bpm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5628077/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660586","pubMedId":"21097213","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying machine learning to detect individual heart beats in ballistocardiograms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying machine learning to detect individual heart beats in ballistocardiograms","confLoc":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","sourcePdf":"04770004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064931S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608545","isNumber":"5625939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608545","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5625939","articleId":"5628077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5628092,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The economic value of the oil reserves that require RTM to be localized is in the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">13</sup>\n dollars. But RTM requires vast computational power, which somewhat hindered its practical success. Although, accelerator-based architectures deliver enormous computational power, little attention has been devoted to assess the RTM implementations effort. The aim of this paper is to identify the major limitations imposed by different accelerators during RTM implementations, and potential bottlenecks regarding architecture features. Moreover, we suggest a wish list, that from our experience, should be included as features in the next generation of accelerators, to cope with the requirements of applications like RTM. We present an RTM algorithm mapping to the IBM Cell/B.E., NVIDIA Tesla and an FPGA platform modeled after the Convey HC-1. All three implementations outperform a traditional processor (Intel Harpertown) in terms of performance (10x), but at the cost of huge development effort, mainly due to immature development frameworks and lack of well-suited programming models. These results show that accelerators are well positioned platforms for this kind of workload. Due to the fact that our RTM implementation is based on an explicit high order finite difference scheme, some of the conclusions of this work can be extrapolated to applications with similar numerical scheme, for instance, magneto-hydrodynamics or atmospheric flow simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing Accelerator-Based HPC Reverse Time Migration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.144","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5644739/05628156.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Assessing Accelerator-Based HPC Reverse Time Migration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5628156/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11666865","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing Accelerator-Based HPC Reverse Time Migration","sourcePdf":"ttd2011010147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168896S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5644739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5644739","articleId":"5628156","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5628254,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Ho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5666469/5628254/5628254-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chan-Ho Choi received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004.

The proposed system transmits with different cyclic delay and phase rotation patterns, in order to achieve cooperative diversity gain for all transmit signals from the source. Since these patterns increase the interference between the layers, we derive optimal cyclic delay and phase rotation patterns to minimize mean square error. With the optimal patterns, the proposed system still suffers from inter-layer interference, especially in high-order modulations. To overcome this problem, multiple layers are separately interleaved by layer-specific interleavers and are mapped by hierarchical symbol mapping for the high data rate transmission with cooperative diversity. A destination structure with iterative equalization is also presented to separate each layer and extract diversity gain for high data rate transmissions. The proposed system can use reliable feedback from the layers and effectively remove the inter-layer interference. To estimate the performance of the proposed system, we develop a density evolution technique. It is shown that the predicted performances agree with simulated performances. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system achieves cooperative diversity and has better performance than conventional cooperative systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.090420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5666469/05628254.pdf","startPage":"3480","endPage":"3490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.090420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Efficient Cooperative Diversity Technique with Multi-Layered Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628254/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Efficient Cooperative Diversity Technique with Multi-Layered Modulation","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693294","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628254/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Efficient Cooperative Diversity Technique with Multi-Layered Modulation","sourcePdf":"3480-tc1012-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080224S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5666469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5666469","articleId":"5628254","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5628256,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.

However, the ICF technique, when implemented with a fixed rectangular window in the frequency-domain, requires many iterations to approach specified PAPR threshold in the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF). In this paper, we develop an optimized ICF method which determines an optimal frequency response filter for each ICF iteration using convex optimization techniques. The design of optimal filter is to minimize signal distortion such that the OFDM symbol's PAPR is below a specified value. Simulation results show that our proposed method can achieve a sharp drop of CCDF curve and reduce PAPR to an acceptable level after only 1 or 2 iterations, whereas the classical ICF method would require 8 to 16 iterations to achieve a similar PAPR reduction. Moreover, the clipped OFDM symbols obtained by our optimized ICF method have less distortion and lower out-of-band radiation than the existing method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05628256.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.090040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.090040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Frequency domain analysis","Convex functions","Bit error rate","Time domain analysis","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","filtering theory","frequency response","iterative methods","limiters","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized iterative clipping","optimized iterative filtering","PAPR reduction","OFDM signal","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency domain","complementary cumulative distribution function","optimal frequency response filter","convex optimization","signal distortion","clipped OFDM symbol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average power ratio","iterative clipping and filtering","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5628256/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744675","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"033-tc1101-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045544S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5628256","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628257,"authors":[{"name":"Edoardo Pasolli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Pasolli","id":"37400441800"},{"name":"Farid Melgani","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Melgani","id":"37274823900"},{"name":"Yakoub Bazi","affiliation":["Advanced Laboratory of Intelligent Systems Research College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Yakoub","lastName":"Bazi","id":"38480650300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5628257","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1282},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Accuracy","Learning systems","Machine learning","Hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machine active learning","significance space construction","remote sensing images","SVM theory","multihyperspectral images","convergence speed","stability","sparseness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning","hyperspectral images","support vector machines (SVMs)","very-high-resolution (VHR) images"]}],"abstract":"Active learning is showing to be a useful approach to improve the efficiency of the classification process for remote sensing images.

In this work, the mitigation of the adverse affects of pulsed-power loads on these systems is considered. In microgrid power systems, pulsed loads are particularly problematic since the total system inertia is finite. Examples include ships and aircraft with high-power radars, pulsed weapons, and electromagnetic launch and recovery systems. In these systems, energy is collected from the system over a finite time period, locally stored, and then rapidly utilized. Herein, a new strategy to accommodate these loads is presented. This strategy is based on identifying the optimal charging profile. Using simulation and experiment, it is shown the proposed strategy is highly effective in reducing the adverse impact of pulsed-power loads.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5629465/05628266.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2080329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2080329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Impact of Pulsed Power Loads on Microgrid Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse power systems","Power quality","Energy storage","Marine vehicles","Military aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power grids","pulsed power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsed power load","microgrid power systems","optimal charging profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Marine vehicles","military aircraft","power quality","pulse power systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Impact of Pulsed Power Loads on Microgrid Power Systems","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5628266/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655624","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Impact of Pulsed Power Loads on Microgrid Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-crider-2080329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079169S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5629465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5629465","articleId":"5628266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5628267,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Guan","affiliation":["SKLMS Laboratoryoratory and MOE KLINNS Laboratory, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China","Center of Intelligent and Networked Systems (CFINS), TNLIST, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5629465/5628267/5628267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaohong Guan (M'93\u2013SM'95\u2013F'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 1993.","He was a Senior Consulting Engineer with PG&E from 1993 to 1995.

Therefore, there is a huge potential for building energy savings through efficient operation. Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources. It is very important to fully utilize solar energy and optimize the operation of electrical storage. It is also shown that precooling is a simple way to achieve energy savings.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2083705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5629465/05628267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2083705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629465","startPage":"243","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Buildings Facilitated by Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Buildings Facilitated by Microgrid","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655619","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5628267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Buildings Facilitated by Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tsg-guan-2083705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067784S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5629465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"352","xplore-issue":"5629465","articleId":"5628267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5628268,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5629465/5628268/5628268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Li (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from Iowa State University, Ames, in 2007.

The current anomaly detection methods are susceptible to anomalies in the processing window range or the image scope. In addition, for the local anomaly detection methods themselves, it is difficult to determine the window size suitable for processing background statistics. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on the random selection of background pixels, the random-selection-based anomaly detector (RSAD). Pixels are randomly selected from the image scene to represent the background statistics; the random selections are performed a sufficient number of times; blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators are used to detect anomalies each time after a proper subset of background pixels is selected; finally, a fusion procedure is employed to avoid contamination of the background statistics by anomaly pixels. In addition, the real-time implementation of the RSAD is also developed by random selection from updating data and QR decomposition. Several hyperspectral data sets are used in the experiments, and the RSAD shows a better performance than the current hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithms. The real-time version also outperforms its real-time counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628269/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","accessionNumber":"11960934","volume":"49","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random-Selection-Based Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-Selection-Based Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2081677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08448S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5753065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"5753065","articleId":"5628269","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628271,"authors":[{"name":"Amir-Hamed Mohsenian-Rad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5629465/5628271/5628271-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir-Hamed Mohsenian-Rad (S'04\u2013M'09) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada, in 2008.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock.

In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the total energy demand, the total energy costs, as well as each user's individual daily electricity charges.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2089069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5629465/05628271.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2089069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Demand-Side Management Based on Game-Theoretic Energy Consumption Scheduling for the Future Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Demand-Side Management Based on Game-Theoretic Energy Consumption Scheduling for the Future Smart Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628271/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11655620","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628271/","volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Demand-Side Management Based on Game-Theoretic Energy Consumption Scheduling for the Future Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-mohsenianrad-2089069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10459S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5629465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"1840","xplore-issue":"5629465","articleId":"5628271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5628278,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Previous studies have focused mainly on the tag population estimation, choosing the frame size based on the classical results of Random Access (RA) systems. We show that a new theory is needed for algorithm design for RFID systems, because RFID and RA systems are fundamentally different. The Philips RFID system is studied in this paper.

The codes have the special structures that the columns of each code matrix can be divided into several orthogonal groups and each group is stacked by several sub-blocks with Toeplitz structure. These codes possess two interesting properties: a) Even under the frequency-asynchronous scenario, the codes can , namely, if R relay nodes participate the cooperation adopting the proposed SFCs, then at the destination node, the achievable diversity order is R; b) Only , such as zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, are required to collect the full cooperative diversity, instead of the maximum likelihood (ML) detector as utilized in most existing STC (SFC) schemes. The codes in this family have different symbol rates, orthogonality and performances for different numbers of relay nodes, which can be adjusted by choosing different design parameters. It is shown that frequency-reversal SFC (FR-SFC), and frequency-shift SFC (FS-SFC) proposed in previous papers are only two special members of the code family, and new SFCs outperforming both of them are proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","volume":"59","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11744657","publicationDate":"January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628281/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full Diversity Space-Frequency Codes for Frequency Asynchronous Cooperative Relay Networks with Linear Receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Diversity Space-Frequency Codes for Frequency Asynchronous Cooperative Relay Networks with Linear Receivers","sourcePdf":"236-tc1101-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077675S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5628281","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5628282,"authors":[{"name":"William C.

Our study shows that the heavier code weight supported by our 2D codes results in better code performance than some of previously proposed 2D codes (of the maximum cross-correlation functions of one and two). The new codes potentially support more subscribers and heavier bursty asynchronous traffic with gradual performance degradation as traffic load increases.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.100035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05628283.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.102910.100035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","startPage":"194","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Optimal 2D Optical Codes Using (n,w,2,2) Optical Orthogonal Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Optimal 2D Optical Codes Using (n,w,2,2) Optical Orthogonal Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744659","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5628283/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Optimal 2D Optical Codes Using (n,w,2,2) Optical Orthogonal Codes","sourcePdf":"194-tc1101-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199627S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5628283","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628284,"authors":[{"name":"Ruey-Yi Wei","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5688266/5628284/5628284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruey-Yi Wei (S'96-M'99) was born in Miaoli, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1971.

We explore the interference pattern of a shared channel in order to establish optimal distributed resource allocation techniques in that channel considering the mutual interference of coexisting links on each other. It is shown that the optimal usage of resources in such a shared channel can only be achieved via a multi-dimensional resource allocation strategy, taking into account not only the link's own channel quality, but also its channel states towards coexisting links. The improvement of capacity as a result of this approach can be attributed to the interference diversity of the channel. The interference diversity gain can be harnessed in time, frequency and space domains. To this end we study two approaches, namely maximizing the capacity of the primary and secondary links under received interference constraint and minimizing the transmitted power of primary and secondary links under minimum QoS guarantee constraint. We study the Ergodic capacity to verify the significant performance improvement which can be achieved by exploiting interference diversity in multi-channel systems such as UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE). Further we will show that utilizing this diversity gain in QoS-guaranteed scenarios results in a considerable transmission power saving. The case of Outage capacity, which is an instantaneous measure of channel throughput, is shown to be different whereby using an instantaneous received interference threshold outperforms the usage of average received interference limit.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102910.090386","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05628285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102910.090386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Diversity Gain and its Application in Multi-Channel Systems: Capacity Maximization and QoS Guarantee Strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Interference Diversity Gain and its Application in Multi-Channel Systems: Capacity Maximization and QoS Guarantee Strategies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628285/","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5628285/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744658","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Diversity Gain and its Application in Multi-Channel Systems: Capacity Maximization and QoS Guarantee Strategies","sourcePdf":"248-tc1101-attar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109501S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5628285","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628294,"authors":[{"name":"Mariam Kaynia","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5628294/5628294-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mariam Kaynia has since August 2007 been a Ph.

The main system objective is correct reception of packets, and thus the analysis is performed in terms of outage probability. In our network model, packets belonging to specific transmitters arrive randomly in space and time according to a 3-D Poisson point process, and are then transmitted to their intended destinations using a fully-distributed MAC protocol. A packet transmission is considered successful if the received SINR is above a predefined threshold for the duration of the packet. Accurate bounds on the outage probabilities are derived as a function of the transmitter density, the number of backoffs and retransmissions, and in the case of CSMA, also the sensing threshold. The analytical expressions are validated with simulation results. For continuous-time transmissions, CSMA with receiver sensing (which involves adding a feedback channel to the conventional CSMA protocol) is shown to yield the best performance. Moreover, the sensing threshold of CSMA is optimized. It is shown that introducing sensing for lower densities (i.e., in sparse networks) is not beneficial, while for higher densities (i.e., in dense networks), using an optimized sensing threshold provides significant gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05628294.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.110310.100316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.110310.100316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Performance of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Through MAC Layer Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Media Access Protocol","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","Poisson distribution","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless ad hoc networks","MAC layer design","ALOHA","CSMA MAC protocols","spatially distributed wireless networks","outage probability","packet transmission","receiver sensing","sensing threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Poisson point process","MAC protocols","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Performance of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Through MAC Layer Design","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5628294/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742927","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Performance of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Through MAC Layer Design","sourcePdf":"240-tw1101-kaynia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082385S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5628294","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628295,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Juan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiao Juan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405051600"},{"name":"Yi Gong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888700"},{"name":"Khaled Ben Letaief","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Khaled Ben","lastName":"Letaief","id":"37273525100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5628295","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"We analyze the impact of imperfect channel state information at the transmitter and receiver (CSITR) on the achievable diversity gain in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) fading channels with joint rate and power control.

The advantage of this approach is its potential to decrease interference to users of macro cell or adjacent femtocells at light traffic load. Performed analytical evaluations of our proposed scheme in comparison to the existing power control mechanisms show that femtocell's transmitting power can be significantly reduced while the same Quality of Service level is still guaranteed to the femtocell users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Power Control Mechanism for Femtocells Based on the Frame Utilization","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2010.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626912/5628670/05628709.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2010.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power Control Mechanism for Femtocells Based on the Frame Utilization","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628709/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649097","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Power Control Mechanism for Femtocells Based on the Frame Utilization","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4182a498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093904S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626912","isNumber":"5628670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626912","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5628670","articleId":"5628709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5628716,"authors":[{"name":"Farshad Sarabchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Poly-Grames Research Center, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Sarabchi","id":"37596743300"},{"name":"Chahe Nerguizian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Poly-Grames Research Center, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Chahe","lastName":"Nerguizian","id":"37300548000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8021-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4182-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5628716","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":517},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation technique","MIMO MB-OFDM UWB cognitive radio","wireless communication systems","active interference cancelation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","MB-OFDM","MIMO","Cognitive Radio","Interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an interference mitigation algorithm for coexistence of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Multiband OFDM ultra wideband (MB UWB) Cognitive Radio systems with other wireless communication systems.

For national security purposes, we advocate a hybrid cloud model that consists of private, public and community clouds. The community clouds in this architecture are as defined by NIST, and will be used for inter-agency and community-of-interest (COI) information sharing and collaboration needs. The security requirements and characteristics of private and public clouds will not differ greatly from the private sector. However, while the architectural characteristics remain the same, we believe that national security community clouds will have different security features than the typical community cloud in order to support COI requirements. In this paper, we focus on the requirements and characteristics of national security community clouds that can meet the needs of COIs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626888/5628720/05628726.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2010.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security and Architectural Issues for National Security Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Communities","National security","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["national security cloud computing","hybrid cloud model","community cloud","NIST","community of interest information sharing","private cloud","public cloud"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Security and Architectural Issues for National Security Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11649333","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and Architectural Issues for National Security Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"4079a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061995S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626888","isNumber":"5628720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626888","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5628720","articleId":"5628726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5628774,"authors":[{"name":"Gongjun Yan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Gongjun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37532486300"},{"name":"Nathalie Mitton","affiliation":["INRIA CNRS University of Lille 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Mitton","id":"37318323500"},{"name":"Xu Li","affiliation":["INRIA CNRS University of Lille 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li","id":"37293186100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7472-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7471-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4079-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-0678"},{"format":"CD","value":"1545-0678"}],"articleNumber":"5628774","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":561},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Vehicles","Routing protocols","Roads","Wireless communication","Mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","radio networks","routing protocols","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vehicular Ad Hoc Network","wireless communication link","VANET routing protocol","connectivity based routing protocol","mobility based routing protocol","infrastructure based routing protocol","geographic-location based routing protocol","probability model based routing protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks","VANET","Routing"]}],"abstract":"One of the notoriously difficult problems in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) is to ensure that established routing paths do not break before the end of data transmission. This is a difficult problem because the network topology is constantly changing and the wireless communication links are inherently unstable, due to high node mobility. In this paper we classify existing VANET routing protocols into five categories: connectivity-based, mobility-based, infrastructure-based, geographic-location-based, and probability-model-based, according to their employed routing metrics. For each category, we present the general design ideas and state of the art. Our objective is to attract more attention to the VANET routing problem and encourage more research efforts on developing reliable solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2010.62","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626888/5628720/05628774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2010.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628720","startPage":"263","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628774/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11649365","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5628774/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"4079a263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103213S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626888","isNumber":"5628720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626888","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5628720","articleId":"5628774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5628796,"authors":[{"name":"Mazin Al-Noor","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Sciences, Middlesex University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mazin","lastName":"Al-Noor","id":"38274406900"},{"name":"Kok-Keong Jonathan Loo","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Sciences, Middlesex University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kok-Keong Jonathan","lastName":"Loo","id":"37302202000"},{"name":"Richard Comley","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Sciences, Middlesex University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Comley","id":"37282353700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8021-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4182-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5628796","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Fiber gratings","Dispersion","WiMAX","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","chirp modulation","mobile communication","optical fibre dispersion","radio-over-fibre","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile WiMAX scalable OFDMA signal transmission","RoF","SMF","DCF","chirped FBG","fibre attenuation","chromatic dispersion","single mode fibre","dispersion compensating fibre","passive chirped fibre Bragg grating","radio over fibre system","bit rate 120 Mbit/s","size 792 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersion compensating fibre (DCF)","chirip Fibre Bragg Grating (CFBG)","Optical Amplifier (EDFAs)","Radio over Fibre (RoF)","Single mode fibre (SMF)"]}],"abstract":"Fibre attenuation and chromatic dispersion are the most important problems that create slops, changes of the frequency spectrum. Therefore the signal can only be clearly transmitted over a limited distance. In order to increase the signal transmission distance and improve the frequency spectrum we study in this paper the combination of different fibres namely single mode fibre (SMF), dispersion compensating fibre (DCF) and passive chirped fibre Bragg grating (CFBG), for use in transmitting 120Mbps mobile WiMAX scalable OFDMA signal with 3.5GHz carrier frequency and 20MHz bandwidth in Radio over Fibre (RoF) system. The DCF and CFBG are used as a dispersion compensator and specifically the high reflector CFBG is used to give the signal a linear delay across the grating band pass. In our study the WIMAX signal is transmitted through a triple symmetrical dispersion system consisting of 2xDCF (20 km) and 2xSMF (100 km) connected to SMF (24 km) and CFBG. Simulation results show that the combination of SMF, DCF and CFBG has increased the transmission distance in fibre to 792 km, and SNR and OSNR are highly satisfactory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"120 Mbps Mobile WiMAX Scalable OFDMA Signal Transmission over RoF with SMF, DCF and Chirped FBG for Fibre Length of 792 km","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2010.102","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626912/5628670/05628796.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2010.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5628796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5628796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"120 Mbps Mobile WiMAX Scalable OFDMA Signal Transmission over RoF with SMF, DCF and Chirped FBG for Fibre Length of 792 km","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5628796/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"120 Mbps Mobile WiMAX Scalable OFDMA Signal Transmission over RoF with SMF, DCF and Chirped FBG for Fibre Length of 792 km","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4182a373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039811S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626912","isNumber":"5628670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626912","xplore-issue":"5628670","articleId":"5628796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5628799,"authors":[{"name":"Alina M.

Accordingly, when the new base station is installed adjacent to a base station or by its own, the research for automatically minimizing the interference and increasing the capacity of the base station by optimizing the cell coverage has become necessary. For this purpose, extremely reducing the cell radius and providing a wireless environment for small business are needed. The femtocell services actively respond to the user's needs for a better wireless environment, and expanding business opportunities for the operators. The most important aspect to consider is the qualitative and quantitative service improvement of the technology.

The approach focuses on identifying these services based on a Model-Driven Architecture approach supported by guidelines over a wide range of possible service types.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOCW.2010.28","publicationTitle":"2010 14th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 14th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626915/5628906/05629010.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"172","doi":"10.1109/EDOCW.2010.28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Architecture Approach to the Efficient Identification of Services on Service-Oriented Enterprise Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Architecture Approach to the Efficient Identification of Services on Service-Oriented Enterprise Architecture","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5629010/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649059","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629010/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Architecture Approach to the Efficient Identification of Services on Service-Oriented Enterprise Architecture","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4164a165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096523S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626915","isNumber":"5628906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626915","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5628906","articleId":"5629010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5629021,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Centre for Telematics and Information Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38253814100"},{"name":"Luis Ferreira Pires","affiliation":["Centre for Telematics and Information Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Luis Ferreira","lastName":"Pires","id":"38196231100"},{"name":"Andreas Wombacher","affiliation":["Centre for Telematics and Information Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wombacher","id":"37267392200"},{"name":"Marten J. van Sinderen","firstName":"Marten J. van","lastName":"Sinderen","id":"37993040900"},{"name":"Chihung Chi","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chihung","lastName":"Chi","id":"37304536900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7965-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6583"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-6605"}],"articleNumber":"5629021","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"Cloud computing is already a major trend in IT.

In particular, it is intended to describe Natural Language (NL) texts in a format that can be understood and processed by computers. Since words with multiple meanings can be found from texts, it becomes necessary to perform Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in order to achieve a correct representation. This paper presents a WSD approach that determines best candidates for word meanings and contributes to a semi-automatic conversion of NL into CDL. We perform preliminary experiments by evaluating the approach with some test sentences and comparing with other WSD methods. Results suggest that the existence of a proper correspondence of syntactic and semantic relations for the WSD process may lead to an accurate conversion to CDL.","doi":"10.1109/ICSC.2010.66","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Semantic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Semantic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626897/5628562/05629030.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSC.2010.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Word Sense Disambiguation Approach for Converting Natural Language Text into a Common Semantic Description","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629030/","displayDocTitle":"A Word Sense Disambiguation Approach for Converting Natural Language Text into a Common Semantic Description","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649276","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629030/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Word Sense Disambiguation Approach for Converting Natural Language Text into a Common Semantic Description","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"4154a478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059423S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626897","isNumber":"5628562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626897","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5628562","articleId":"5629030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5629051,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

The growing social pressure, new environmental legislation, and increasing customer demand for green products is forcing companies to address all sustainability challenges related to increased operational profit, the environment, social impacts, and legislation in a holistic and proactive way. Companies are looking for solutions on how to minimise environmental impacts and risks caused by the global supply chain from farm to consumer while improving supply chain value and performance. Sustainability is being perceived as a cost instead of adding value to the company. Addressing all sustainability challenges requires an integrated systematic approach beyond and above the current disparity of silo systems in the supply chain.

AM allows the rapid development of sustainable products and has been increasingly used to produce lightweight components to save materials and costs. This particularly helps to save a considerable amount of material, energy and cost for the production of one-off or small volume products. In addition, the non-processed raw materials can be recycled and re-used by AM to reduce material waste drastically. AM is therefore considered as a sustainable manufacturing approach driving the rapid development of new products. The paper will present and review the research activities performed in the University of Exeter to enhance the sustainability of AM.

For a successful decoding task an inherent stopping criterion is used: the fulfillment of all parity-check constraints. For an unsuccessful task the decoder usually completes a preset maximum number of iterations. Proper iteration control is required to save energy and time on unnecessary decoder operation when processing undecodable blocks. In this paper we propose an iteration control policy that is driven by the combination of two decision metrics. One is the number of satisfied parity-check constraints and the second one is provided by a specific message computation kernel: the Self-Corrected Min-Sum decoding algorithm. Our results show that this hybrid control policy offers superior performance in terms of energy efficiency compared to previously proposed techniques. In addition we show empirically how stopping criteria should be tuned as a function of false alarm and missed detection rates.","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2010.45","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626912/5628670/05629114.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2010.45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Iteration Control on LDPC Decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Iteration Control on LDPC Decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629114/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11649146","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629114/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Iteration Control on LDPC Decoders","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4182a102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057596S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626912","isNumber":"5628670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626912","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5628670","articleId":"5629114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5629137,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfeng Li","affiliation":["College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-199-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629137","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concrete","recycling","slag","steel industry","workability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recycling","steel slag","green concrete","durability","solid waste discharge","iron industry","steel industry","admixture","workability","mechanical properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["steel slag","concrete","durability","workability","mechanical properties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629137","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618869/5629050/05629137.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0472","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629050","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recycling techniques of steel slag and its utilization in green concrete to enhance properties and durability","abstract":"Steel slag is a solid waste discharged in large quantities by the iron and steel industry.

Finally, the reliability design of remanufacturing is defined and the reliability prediction and allocation methods are investigated.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0408","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618869/5629050/05629157.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remanufacturing mode and its reliability for the design of automotive products","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Remanufacturing mode and its reliability for the design of automotive products","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629157/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11477058","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remanufacturing mode and its reliability for the design of automotive products","confLoc":"Ningbo","sourcePdf":"20100408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044924S","chronDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","isNumber":"5629050","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618869","articleId":"5629157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5629159,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Nauman Abbasi","affiliation":["Institute of Management Sciences, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Nauman Abbasi"},{"name":"Chee Yew Wong","affiliation":["Business School & Logistics Institute, University of Hull, Hull, UK"],"lastName":"Chee Yew Wong"},{"name":"Chandra Lalwani","affiliation":["Business School & Logistics Institute, University of Hull, Hull, UK"],"firstName":"Chandra","lastName":"Lalwani"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-199-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629159","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consumer behaviour","government","industrial waste","investment","plastics industry","recycling","supply chains","waste handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recycling attitudes","plastics recycling supply chains","recycling behaviours","households","scrap dealers","plastics preprocessors","plastics recyclers","moulders","converters","consumer recycling behaviour","plastics recyclables","financial benefits","material recovery facility","government","investment","waste sorting","waste storage","plastics waste","Th\u00f8gersen's model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solid waste management","plastic recycling","recycling attitude","recycling behaviour","green manufacturing"]}],"abstract":"This paper compares recycling attitudes and behaviours of key participants in Pakistan's plastics recycling supply chains. It involved mainly cross sectional surveys of 360 households and 51 scrap dealers, and multiple case studies with 26 plastics pre-processors and 28 plastics recyclers (moulders/converters) at seven cities in Pakistan. Guided by the model of consumer recycling behaviour proposed by Th\u00f8gersen (International Journal of Research in Marketing, 1994, 11, pp. 145-163) this paper found a mix of different attitudes and behaviours. It appears that households lacked awareness of the process involved after plastics recyclables are collected and they lacked opportunity to participate; furthermore their recycling behaviour was largely motivated by financial benefits. Material recovery facilities provided by the government appeared to be inadequate. For other private-sector participants (scrap dealers, re-processor and moulders), they lacked investment in equipments for sorting and storage of plastics waste. We further explain the roles of social norms, ability to recycle, opportunity to recycle and motivation (awareness or monetary) and extend Th\u00f8gersen's model to include not just households but also scrap dealers, re-processors and moulders. The developed measurement instrument is useful to study other recycling supply chains.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0410","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618869/5629050/05629159.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recycling attitudes & behaviours: A study of plastics recycling supply chains in Pakistan","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Recycling attitudes & behaviours: A study of plastics recycling supply chains in Pakistan","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629159/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11477060","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recycling attitudes & behaviours: A study of plastics recycling supply chains in Pakistan","confLoc":"Ningbo","sourcePdf":"20100410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021661S","chronDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","isNumber":"5629050","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618869","articleId":"5629159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5629160,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Zhi-hai","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing, Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cai Zhi-hai"},{"name":"Han Shu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing, Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Han Shu"},{"name":"Zhang Ping","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing, Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Ping"},{"name":"Liang Zhijie","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing, Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liang Zhijie"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-199-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629160","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629160","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["engines","machinery production industries","recycling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evaluation system","heavy duty caterpillar engine","equipment remanufacturing technology","civil vehicle engine","surface engineering","engine remanufacture criterion systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heavy duty caterpillar","engine","remanufacturing technology","evaluation system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the research development of equipment remanufacturing technology in the world has been introduced.

The finished constructed wetland is located next to the famous old Kaoping River Rail Bridge at Kaohsiung County, and thus, it is named Kaoping River Rail Bridge Constructed Wetland. The major flowflow comes from the local drainage systems containing untreated domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastewater, and treated industrial wastewater from a paper mill. Based on the quarterly investigation results of water samples taken from 2008 to 2009, more than 96% of total coliforms (TC), 48% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and 40% of nutrients (e.g., total nitrogen, total phosphorus) were removed with the help of the constructed wetland system. Thus, the wetland system has a significant effect on the improvement of the water quality and is capable of removing most of the pollutants from the local drainage system before they are discharged into Kaoping River. The Kaoping River Rail Bridge Constructed Wetland has become one of the most successful multi-function constructed wetlands in Taiwan. The experience obtained from this project will be helpful in designing similar natural water treatment systems for the improvement of the river water quality for other river basins.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0477","startPage":"494","endPage":"501","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618869/5629050/05629190.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying natural treatment systems for the improvement of the quality of river water","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629190/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Applying natural treatment systems for the improvement of the quality of river water","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11477125","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying natural treatment systems for the improvement of the quality of river water","confLoc":"Ningbo","sourcePdf":"20100477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051384S","chronDate":"11-13 Jan. 2010","isNumber":"5629050","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618869","articleId":"5629190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5629191,"authors":[{"name":"Xiujie Jia","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Xiujie Jia"},{"name":"Jianfeng Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Jianfeng Li"},{"name":"Fangyi Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Fangyi Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-199-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629191","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bending","compressive testing","environmental factors","natural fibres","raw materials","wood products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium density fiberboard","plant fiber","corn viscose","MDF","binder","reinforcement material","wood","raw material","colorless viscose","quality viscose","process flow","bending test","compression test","formaldehyde"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Environment","Plant Fiber Complex Board","Protection Material","Viscose"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629191","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618869/5629050/05629191.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0474","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629050","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Responsive Manufacturing - Green Manufacturing (ICRM 2010)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of new type Medium Density Fiberboard based on plant fiber and corn viscose","abstract":"A novel method for producing Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) is described based on a combination of corn viscose as a binder and plant fibre as a reinforcement material.

Two methods to make corn viscose are discussed, namely colorless viscose at cool water or quality viscose at normal temperature. A process, involving process flow to produce MDF using the novel techniques outlined is proposed. Bending and compression tests indicate the relative quality of the new type of MDF.

The system that averages multiple previous data pulses to form a cleaner template can reduce the noise level, but it does not need to transmit any reference signals before data-modulated waveforms. Furthermore, a combination of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and impulse radio (IR) based UWB transmitter architecture is developed. The DSSS is used only for multiple access. At the transmitter, a 0.5 ns wide UWB pulse is generated via a step recovery diode (SRD) and Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is implemented using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Other modulations could be easily designed by using software. Simulation results show that ADTR-DSSS-IR-UWB scheme could greatly reduce the transceiver complexity and is suitable for a variety of ultra-wideband communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications and Intelligence Information Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626945/5628876/05629231.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications and Intelligence Information Security","doi":"10.1109/ICCIIS.2010.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIIS.2010.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of ADTR-DSSS-IR-UWB Transmitter for BPSK Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Binary phase shift keying","Ultra wideband technology","Schottky diodes","Transmitters","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","phase shift keying","transceivers","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average differential transmitted reference","direct sequence spread spectrum","impulse radio ultra wideband transmitter","ADTR-DSSS-IR-UWB transmitter","binary phase shift keying","BPSK modulation","ultra wideband transceiver","step recovery diode","field programmable gate array","FPGA","ultra-wideband communication systems","time 0.5 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","SRD","BPSK","DSSS","IR","ADTR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of ADTR-DSSS-IR-UWB Transmitter for BPSK Modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11648903","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of ADTR-DSSS-IR-UWB Transmitter for BPSK Modulation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4260a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050234S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626945","isNumber":"5628876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626945","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5628876","articleId":"5629231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5629240,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Restriction, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ma","id":"38666976400"},{"name":"Ying-chun Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Restriction, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Ying-chun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085960382"},{"name":"Zi-fa Zhong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Restriction, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zi-fa","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37553181700"},{"name":"Xiang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Restriction, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085958215"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8649-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4260-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629240","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Electromagnetics","Monitoring","Artificial immune systems","Signal detection","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","electromagnetic wave transmission","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalistic electromagnetism signal detection","artificial immune system","detection probability","electromagnetic spectrum monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomalistic Signal Detection","Electromagnetism Spectrum Monitoring","Artificial Immune System","Complex Electromagnetic Environment"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyses the realistic requirement for the of electromagnetic signal detection in a complicated electromagnetic environment, and then suggests the conception of anomalistic electromagnetism signal.

Unfortunately, present existing systems come fast to their limits if a great amount of RFID transponder must be inventoried in very short time, as the channel access method of current RFID systems is Time Division Multiple Access. To shorten the inventory process, this work shows a first realization of an RFID-based semi-active UHF transponder using a Code Division Multiple Access method. The work concentrates on the uplink channel (tag to reader) that covers the transponder's backscattered signals. This channel access method enables simultaneous transfer of data, meaning that all transponder in the field may respond at the same time within the same frequency band. The data transfer realized for the uplink channel, uses a certain set of orthogonal spreading sequences (modified Gold codes) being different for every transponder. The RFID reader used in this work despreads the backscattered signals and decodes the data of the different transponder. Briefly, this work shows, in principle, the opportunity for a simultaneous data transfer on the uplink channel in RFID systems, which in turn may shorten very much the time for a complete inventory round.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of a CDMA-based RFID System Using a Semi-active UHF Transponder","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2010.78","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626912/5628670/05629270.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Realization of a CDMA-based RFID System Using a Semi-active UHF Transponder","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629270/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649180","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of a CDMA-based RFID System Using a Semi-active UHF Transponder","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4182a005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04576S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626912","isNumber":"5628670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626912","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5628670","articleId":"5629270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5629276,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Lang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Lang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278393800"},{"name":"Da-You Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Da-You","lastName":"Hong","id":"37593018800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8021-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4182-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629276","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"abstract":"Novel subspace-based channel estimation is proposed for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) zero-padded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ZP-OFDM) systems.

The principle is to exploit the statistical advantages of a specific signal added in the transmitter to estimate the channel coefficients. In contrast to a pilots signal, the added signal covers the entire useful signal band during all of the communication delay. The advantage of this proposal is to estimate the channel by kipping the same spectral efficiency. This proposal is compared to Zero-Forcing estimator with LS equalizer and MMSE equalizer.

Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is a promising cryptographic solution to these issues for enforcing access control policies defined by a data owner on outsourced data. However, the problem of applying the attribute-based encryption in an outsourced architecture introduces several challenges with regard to the attribute and user revocation. In this paper, we propose an access control mechanism using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to enforce access control policies with efficient attribute and user revocation capability. The fine-grained access control can be achieved by dual encryption mechanism which takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption and selective group key distribution in each attribute group. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed mechanism to securely manage the outsourced data. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure in the data outsourcing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed

could evolve to all-optical mesh networks in the coming future. Considering the impact of physical layer impairments in the planning and operation of all-optical (and translucent) networks is the main focus of the Dynamic Impairment Constraint Optical Networking (DICONET) project. The impairment aware network planning and operation tool (NPOT) is the main outcome of DICONET project, which is explained in detail in this paper. The key building blocks of the NPOT, consisting of network description repositories, the physical layer performance evaluator, the impairment aware routing and wavelength assignment engines, the component placement modules, failure handling, and the integration of NPOT in the control plane are the main contributions of this study. Besides, the experimental result of DICONET proposal for centralized and distributed control plane integration schemes and the performance of the failure handling in terms of restoration time is presented in this study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5629342/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"11809223","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Demonstration of an Impairment Aware Network Planning and Operation Tool for Transparent/Translucent Optical Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Demonstration of an Impairment Aware Network Planning and Operation Tool for Transparent/Translucent Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-azodolmolky-2091622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146271S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5703205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5703205","articleId":"5629342","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5629350,"authors":[{"name":"Katrina D.

However, its practical implementation is usually based on a costly fine grid-search procedure, making the computational cost of the method a real issue. In this letter, we introduce an effective strategy that extends the conventional SRP-PHAT functional with the aim of considering the volume surrounding the discrete locations of the spatial grid. As a result, the modified functional performs a full exploration of the sampled space rather than computing the SRP at discrete spatial positions, increasing its robustness and allowing for a coarser spatial grid. To this end, the Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC) function corresponding to each microphone pair must be properly accumulated according to the defined microphone setup. Experiments carried out under different acoustic conditions confirm the validity of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2091502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2091502","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5640365/05629353.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified SRP-PHAT Functional for Robust Real-Time Sound Source Localization With Scalable Spatial Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Modified SRP-PHAT Functional for Robust Real-Time Sound Source Localization With Scalable Spatial Sampling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629353/","accessionNumber":"11702208","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629353/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified SRP-PHAT Functional for Robust Real-Time Sound Source Localization With Scalable Spatial Sampling","sourcePdf":"lsp-cobos-2091502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040251S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5640365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5640365","articleId":"5629353","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5629364,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Mazzini","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5679854/5629364/5629364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Mazzini (M'09) was born in Brescia, Italy.

This requires relatively fast mapping of the shape and location of the down-hole well structures. Practical factors prohibit the use of visual and other range sensors in this situation. Here, the feasibility of using a robotic manipulator for tactile mapping is studied. A method is developed that requires only robot joint encoders and avoids the use of any force or tactile sensors, which are complex and unreliable in such a hostile environment. This paper addresses the general problem of intelligent tactile exploration of constrained internal geometries when time is critical. It is assumed that the time required to move a manipulator to acquire a new touch point outweighs computational time. This approach models the down-hole structures with geometric primitives and focuses on exploration efficiency by intelligently searching for new touch points to build the geometric models. The algorithms developed here are shown in simulations and laboratory experiments to substantially reduce the data acquisition effort for exploration with a tactile manipulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2084270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5679854/05629364.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"429","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2084270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tactile Robotic Mapping of Unknown Surfaces, With Application to Oil Wells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Tactile Robotic Mapping of Unknown Surfaces, With Application to Oil Wells","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5629364/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11729590","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tactile Robotic Mapping of Unknown Surfaces, With Application to Oil Wells","sourcePdf":"tim-mazzini-2084270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130289S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5679854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5679854","articleId":"5629364","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5629375,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Rodan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Rodan","id":"37589487300"},{"name":"Peter Tino","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Tino","id":"37330720800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5629375","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":319,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2987},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reservoirs","Thyristors","Training","Time series analysis","Topology","Communication channels","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","storage management","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum complexity echo state network","reservoir computing","state-space models","state transition structure","time series","memory capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Echo state networks","memory capability","neural networks","reservoir computing","simple recurrent time-series prediction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Linear Models","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Software Design","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"Reservoir computing (RC) refers to a new class of state-space models with a fixed state transition structure (the reservoir) and an adaptable readout form the state space. The reservoir is supposed to be sufficiently complex so as to capture a large number of features of the input stream that can be exploited by the reservoir-to-output readout mapping. The field of RC has been growing rapidly with many successful applications. However, RC has been criticized for not being principled enough. Reservoir construction is largely driven by a series of randomized model-building stages, with both researchers and practitioners having to rely on a series of trials and errors. To initialize a systematic study of the field, we concentrate on one of the most popular classes of RC methods, namely echo state network, and ask: What is the minimal complexity of reservoir construction for obtaining competitive models and what is the memory capacity (MC) of such simplified reservoirs? On a number of widely used time series benchmarks of different origin and characteristics, as well as by conducting a theoretical analysis we show that a simple deterministically constructed cycle reservoir is comparable to the standard echo state network methodology. The (short-term) of linear cyclic reservoirs can be made arbitrarily close to the proved optimal value.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2089641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5680555/05629375.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2089641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Complexity Echo State Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Complexity Echo State Network","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742251","pubMedId":"21075721","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Complexity Echo State Network","sourcePdf":"tnn-rodan-2089641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052057S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","isNumber":"5680555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"319","articleId":"5629375","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5629387,"authors":[{"name":"Weikai Xu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5676420/5629387/5629387-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weikai Xu (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Three Gorges College, Chongqing, China, in 2000 and the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from the Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Chongqing, in 2003.

The single relay cooperative network with decode-and-forward relay is investigated in the proposed system according to two cooperation protocols, namely, conventional cooperation and space-time cooperation. Unlike conventional CDMA cooperative communication (CDMA-CC) systems, quite surprisingly power control devices that consume more energy to mitigate near-far effects can be avoided in the proposed system, which is of great importance to energy-constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks. Simulation results demonstrate that, through a conventional cooperation mechanism, the proposed system has a prominent advantage of good bit-error-probability (BEP) performance over the CDMA-CC systems that have a single path correlation receiver, at the same data rate with a high SNR range over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Meanwhile, it is found that conventional cooperation is a better cooperation strategy relative to space-time cooperation in the proposed system. In addition, a lower bound of BEP performance is derived and verified by simulations over independent three-ray Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5676420/05629387.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of DCSK Cooperative Communication Systems Over Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629387/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of DCSK Cooperative Communication Systems Over Multipath Fading Channels","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727768","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629387/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of DCSK Cooperative Communication Systems Over Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcsi-xu-2071730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092497S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5676420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5676420","articleId":"5629387","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5629389,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Terciyanli","affiliation":["Power Electronics Group, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5673376/5629389/5629389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alper Terciyanl\u0131 received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2001, 2004, and 2010, respectively.","Currently, he is a Chief Research Engineer with the Power Electronics Department of TUB\u0130TAK UZAY, Ankara.

However, if implemented in a large scale without control, peak load increases significantly and the grid may be overloaded. Two algorithms to address this problem are proposed and analyzed. Both are based on a forecast of future electricity prices and use dynamic programming to find the economically optimal solution for the vehicle owner. The first optimizes the charging time and energy flows. It reduces daily electricity cost substantially without increasing battery degradation. The latter also takes into account vehicle to grid support as a means of generating additional profits by participating in ancillary service markets. Constraints caused by vehicle utilization as well as technical limitations are taken into account. An analysis, based on data of the California independent system operator, indicates that smart charge timing reduces daily electricity costs for driving from $0.43 to $0.2. Provision of regulating power substantially improves plug-in hybrid electric vehicle economics and the daily profits amount to $1.71, including the cost of driving.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Charge Control of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Deregulated Electricity Markets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2086083","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05629391.pdf","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2086083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Charge Control of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Deregulated Electricity Markets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5629391/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175091","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Charge Control of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Deregulated Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-rotering-2086083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063579S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"447","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5629391","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5629392,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5958775/5629392/5629392-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Wang (S'87\u2013M'88\u2013SM'05) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, in June 1988.","He has been an Associate Professor and a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan, in 1988 and 1995, respectively.

The studied OWF is simulated by an equivalent 80-MW doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by an equivalent wind turbine through an equivalent gearbox using an aggregation method. The damping controller of the rectifier current regulator (RCR) of the proposed HVDC link is designed by using modal control theory to contribute adequate damping to the studied OWF under various wind speeds and different disturbance conditions. A systematic analysis using a frequency-domain approach based on eigenvalue calculations and a time-domain scheme based on nonlinear model simulations is performed. The eigenvalue analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the designed damping controller under different wind speeds. The nonlinear model simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed damping controller under various disturbance conditions. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the proposed line-commutated HVDC link joined with the designed damping controller not only can render adequate damping characteristics to the studied DFIG-based OWF under various wind speeds but also effectively mitigate the fluctuations of the OWF under disturbance conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Damping","Converters","Mathematical model","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Wind turbines","Wind speed"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","control system synthesis","damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","electric current control","HVDC power transmission","power generation control","power grids","time-frequency analysis","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic stability analysis","DFIG-based offshore wind farm","power grid","HVDC link","OWF","line-commutated high-voltage direct-current link","doubly-fed induction generator","aggregation method","rectifier current regulator","RCR","equivalent gearbox","equivalent wind turbine","modal control theory","frequency-domain approach","eigenvalue calculations","time-domain scheme","designed damping controller","wind speeds","DFIG-based OWF","power 80 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly-fed induction generator","eigenvalue analysis","high-voltage direct-current","nonlinear model simulations","offshore wind farm","rectifier current regulator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2085053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05629392.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2085053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Stability Analysis of a DFIG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Connected to a Power Grid Through an HVDC Link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Stability Analysis of a DFIG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Connected to a Power Grid Through an HVDC Link","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629392/","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629392/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12175092","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Stability Analysis of a DFIG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Connected to a Power Grid Through an HVDC Link","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2085053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118243S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5629392","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5629393,"authors":[{"name":"Lidong Zhang","affiliation":["ABB Power Systems AB, Ludvika, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5958775/5629393/5629393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lidong Zhang (M'07) was born in 1969 in Shanxi province, China.

As a comparison, the analysis has been done by the phasor approach and the space-vector approach. While the phasor approach is straightforward to apply and gives intuitive analytical results, the space-vector approach reflects more dynamic insights of the system. This is achieved by using a unified dynamic modeling of both the ac system and the VSC by means of a new introduced modeling approach Jacobian transfer matrices. This approach shows that non-minimum-phase phenomena due to competing effects between alternating voltages and currents following phase-angle changes impose a fundamental limitation on the achievable bandwidth of the VSC-HVDC link. At moderate voltage levels, a VSC-HVDC link operating in alternating-voltage control mode is able to achieve higher bandwidth than in reactive-power control mode since the right-half plane (RHP) zero is located further from the origin in the former mode.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2085052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2085052","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05629393.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Stability Limitations of a VSC-HVDC Link Using Power-Synchronization Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Stability Limitations of a VSC-HVDC Link Using Power-Synchronization Control","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629393/","accessionNumber":"12175093","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629393/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Stability Limitations of a VSC-HVDC Link Using Power-Synchronization Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2085052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096735S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5629393","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5629426,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Amri Md.

Two nitrates forms, namely sodium nitrates and ammonium nitrates, were mixed in several different ratios dissolved in 1 L of distilled water and were used to observe the response of the sensors. Initial results show that the sensors can detect very well the presence of nitrate added in distilled water. Furthermore, the contamination level of water samples which were taken from various sources and locations in New Zealand have been determined using the sensor, and the results was compared with the results obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The outcomes show a very good correlation of contamination level with the output response of the sensor.

The experimental results show that the distribution of the interface traps is significantly correlated with the source/drain doping concentration, and this 3-D DRAM cell transistor was found to have greater immunity to F-N gate stress in the gate-drain overlapping region than in the channel region, due to the gate oxide thickness profile of the recess-channel-type structure.

To confirm the improved switching speed, we monitored the real-time oscilloscope response.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2010.2084560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2010.2084560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5673448/05629432.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Switching Uniformity and Speed in Filament-Type RRAM Using Lightning Rod Effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved Switching Uniformity and Speed in Filament-Type RRAM Using Lightning Rod Effect","volume":"32","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Switching Uniformity and Speed in Filament-Type RRAM Using Lightning Rod Effect","sourcePdf":"led-park-2084560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078669S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5673448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5673448","articleId":"5629432","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5629433,"authors":[{"name":"Nagarajan Raghavan","affiliation":["Division of Microelectronics, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nagarajan","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37410201300"},{"name":"Kin Leong Pey","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore","Division of Microelectronics, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kin Leong","lastName":"Pey","id":"37268251000"},{"name":"Kalya Shubhakar","affiliation":["Division of Microelectronics, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kalya","lastName":"Shubhakar","id":"37589391900"},{"name":"Michel Bosman","affiliation":[" Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Bosman","id":"37399333600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5629433","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":682},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Logic gates","Analytical models","Dielectrics","Electric breakdown","Grain boundaries","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grain boundaries","high-k dielectric thin films","leakage currents","percolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified percolation model","oxide breakdown percolation model","microstructural weakest link grain boundary defects","polycrystalline high-\u03ba gate stacks","stress-induced leakage current degradation","oxide trap generation","HK dielectric thin films","GB-related failures","non-Weibull stochastics","polycrystalline HK stacks","percolation models","uniform defect generation","failure statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grain boundary (GB)","high-$\\kappa$  (HK)","percolation","process-induced trap (PIT)","stress-induced leakage current (SILC)","time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB)"]}],"abstract":"We modify the existing oxide breakdown (BD) percolation model in this letter to account for the presence of microstructural weakest link grain boundary (GB) defects in polycrystalline high-\u03ba (HK) gate stacks.

Although advanced ECCs such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can provide significantly stronger error-correction capability over BCH codes being used in current practice, their decoding requires soft-decision log-likelihood ratio (LLR) information. This results in two critical issues. First, accurate calculation of LLR demands fine-grained memory-cell sensing, which nevertheless tends to incur implementation overhead and access latency penalty. Hence, it is critical to minimize the fine-grained memory sensing precision. Second, accurate calculation of LLR also demands the availability of a memory-cell threshold-voltage distribution model. As the major source for memory-cell threshold-voltage distribution distortion, cell-to-cell interference must be carefully incorporated into the model. However, these two critical issues have not been ever addressed in the open literature. This paper attempts to address these open issues. We derive mathematical formulations to approximately model the threshold-voltage distribution of memory cells in the presence of cell-to-cell interference, based on which the calculation of LLRs is mathematically formulated. This paper also proposes a nonuniform memory sensing strategy to reduce the memory sensing precision and, thus, sensing latency while still maintaining good error-correction performance. In addition, we investigate these design issues under the scenario when we can also sense interfering cells and hence explicitly estimate cell-to-cell interference strength. We carry out extensive computer simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and involved tradeoffs, assuming the use of LDPC codes in 2-bits/cell NAND Flash memory.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071990","startPage":"429","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5702426/05629456.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5702426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Soft-Decision Error-Correction Codes in nand Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Soft-Decision Error-Correction Codes in nand Flash Memory","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11775479","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5629456/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Soft-Decision Error-Correction Codes in nand Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tcsi-dong-2071990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202725S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5702426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"5702426","articleId":"5629456","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5629457,"authors":[{"name":"Wooram Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5719221/5629457/5629457-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wooram Lee (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

The power amplifier exhibits a 350-MHz bandwidth within which a drain efficiency that is better than 60% and an output power that is higher than 22 dBm were measured. In addition, by adopting three-harmonic termination strategy, excellent second- and third-harmonic suppression levels of 50 and 46 dBc, respectively, were obtained.

We implement an interior-point-type method to reduce the number of iterations (and hence the number of experiment runs). We discuss the system-theoretic interpretations of the resulting optimization problem that lead to reductions in computational complexity and compare the performance of the implementation based on the interior-point method to another approach based on the active set method on a simulation example.

First, we identify the regime in which EF relaying yields substantial gains where the SNR is low and the relay-destination link is strong. Then we discover design simplifications that reduce complexity with little loss in the above regime. For relay quantizer design, we first consider mean-squared distortion minimization. To illustrate the unsuitability of the approach, we present an example with AWGN links and a BPSK source where the quantizer with worst mean squared distortion in a given set maximizes achievable rate. A distortion-minimizing quantizer attempts to preserve the received signal at the relay. The quantizer should instead preserve source information. In information theoretical terms, the quantizer should maximize the mutual information between the source transmission and the quantizer output conditioned on the side information at the destination subject to a rate constraint. The above conclusion, derived from information theoretical principles, is then translated to a quantizer design method for the low SNR regime. Using LDPC codes of blocklength 100000, BPSK modulation, and quantizers designed using the proposed criterion, we observe performance less than a decibel away from the achievable rate at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5629490/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744651","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical Quantizer Design for Half-Duplex Estimate-and-Forward Relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Quantizer Design for Half-Duplex Estimate-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"074-tc1101-chakrabarti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072447S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5629490","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5629491,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of ECIT, Queen's University, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Jinsong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279164000"},{"name":"Colin F.

The latter condition constraints the achievable throughput of a cognitive radio network, which should therefore access a wideband spectrum in order to provide reliable and efficient services to its users. In this paper, we study the problem of designing the optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy, in order to maximize the ergodic throughput of a cognitive radio that employs simultaneous multiband detection and operates under two different schemes, namely the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) and the wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) scheme. We consider average transmit and interference power constraints for both schemes, in order to effectively protect the primary users from harmful interference, propose two algorithms that acquire the optimal sensing time and power allocation under imperfect spectrum sensing for the two schemes and discuss the effect of the average transmit and interference power constraint on the optimal sensing time. Finally, we provide simulation results to compare the two schemes and validate our theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629492/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744662","volume":"59","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Sensing Time and Power Allocation in Multiband Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Sensing Time and Power Allocation in Multiband Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"226-tc1101-stotas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052169S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5629492","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5629495,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5688266/5629495/5629495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen (S'06) received the Bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2004 and the M.Phil degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2007.

Thus, how to stimulate cooperation among nodes in cognitive networks is very important. However, most of existing game-theoretic cooperation stimulation approaches rely on the assumption that the interactions between any pair of players are long-lasting. When this assumption is not true, according to the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and the backward induction principle, the unique Nash equilibrium (NE) is to always play non-cooperatively. In this paper, we propose a cooperation stimulation scheme for the scenario where the number of interactions between any pair of players are finite. The proposed algorithm is based on indirect reciprocity game modelling where the key concept is \"I help you not because you have helped me but because you have helped others\". We formulate the problem of finding the optimal action rule as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a modified value iteration algorithm to find the optimal action rule. Using the packet forwarding game as an example, we show that with an appropriate cost-to-gain ratio, the strategy of forwarding the number of packets that is equal to the reputation level of the receiver is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Finally, simulations are shown to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744669","htmlLink":"/document/5629495/","displayDocTitle":"Indirect Reciprocity Game Modelling for Cooperation Stimulation in Cognitive Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect Reciprocity Game Modelling for Cooperation Stimulation in Cognitive Networks","sourcePdf":"159-tc1101-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083904S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5629495","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5629496,"authors":[{"name":"Maged F.

Due to parameters' variation during operation of induction motor, the decoupling and linearization implemented by field oriented control(FOC) and analytical inverse control(ANIC) is destroyed. For that, a novel linearization and decoupling method named as artificial neural network(ANN) inverse for induction motor control is proposed. It is characterized by that the construction of the ANN inverse is independent of the motor model and parameters. Cascading the ANN inverse which consists of a static ANN and four integrators with the motor, the multivariable, nonlinear and strongly coupled system is decoupled into two independent second-order linear subsystems, or rotor speed subsystem and rotor flux one, so as to be easy to design the closed-loop linear regulator to control each of the subsystems. Simulation and primary experiment results show that the good static and dynamic decoupling performance and the strong robustness to both variation of parameters and load torque disturbance can be achieved by using the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629558/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11647568","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629558/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Decoupling Control of Induction Motor Based on Artificial Neural Network Inverse System Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Decoupling Control of Induction Motor Based on Artificial Neural Network Inverse System Method","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031c287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047118S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5629558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5629618,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598109700"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37559503200"},{"name":"Chuan Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37596766000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629618","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Hysteresis","Inverters","Switches","Leg","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","feedback","hysteresis","invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase four-leg inverter","distributed generation systems","power quality","dynamic reference voltage hysteresis control scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-phase four-leg inverter","Hysteresis control","Unbalanced and nonlinear load"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629618","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.1091","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","abstract":"As the output unit of variety distributed generation systems, the final power quality is determined by three-phase four-leg inverter.

The novel algorithm uses a space-filling experimental design named symmetric Latin hypercube design (SLHD) to initialize the population which can obviously improve the uniformity of the individual distribution. A permutation of population individual indexes is generated and then a neighborhood for each population individual is defined according to the permutation. A differential evolution inspired neighborhood recombination operator, which based on the neighbors of each population member, is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of the algorithm with no compromise of efficiency. The DE inspired operator is then invoked into the clone immune algorithm (CIA) to solve multi-objective problems (MOPs). We compare the proposed algorithm with NSGA2 and SPEA2 by executing it to 5 famous test functions. The results show that the proposed algorithm can fast converge to the global Pareto front and also can sustain a very uniform distribution. It is a potential algorithm for solving MOPs.","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.218","startPage":"850","endPage":"854","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05629658.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Evolution Inspired Clone Immune Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloning","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Evolutionary computation","Erbium","Hypercubes","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution","clone immune multiobjective optimization","symmetric Latin hypercube design","permutation","global Pareto front"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["differential evolution","clone immune","multi-objective","neighborhood recombination","symmetric Latin hypercube design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Differential Evolution Inspired Clone Immune Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629658/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11647672","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Evolution Inspired Clone Immune Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031a850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09413S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5629658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5629669,"authors":[{"name":"Fangni Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fangni","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629669","dbTime":"60 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulation","Encoding","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate control technology","RCP-LDPC code","cooperative cognitive UWB system","wireless communication","random puncture scheme"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative cognitive UWB system is one of the hottest topics in wireless communication areas.

ACPBD introduces centrality metric- average contact probability. The value of nodes average contact probability is calculated which used for choosing the next hop. In order to optimize node queue, ACPBD employs TTL to decide message's transmission and dropping for minimizing transmission overhead.

Four fractional frequency reuse (FFR) schemes, improving cell-edge user's performance are derived. A low complexity scheduling algorithm is proposed based on these schemes. This FFR-based scheduling algorithm selects user for transmission according to mapping in FFR and scheduling policy. Performance of FFR as well as FFR-based scheduling is analyzed via simulations. The results demonstrate that, FFR(III) has highest user throughput among four schemes. Furthermore, FFR(III) outperforms other schemes in cell-edge user throughput for 8/9 reuse and is the most robust scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05629810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5629810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5629810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and FFR-Based Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Throughput","Scheduling","Frequency conversion","Resource management","Complexity theory","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","scheduling","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","fractional frequency reuse","FFR-based scheduling","Cantor set theory","cell-edge user performance","low complexity scheduling","scheduling policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and FFR-Based Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11642503","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and FFR-Based Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"04-049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030994S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628463","isNumber":"5629505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628463","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629505","articleId":"5629810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5629897,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089079135"},{"name":"Qingwu Gong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, China"],"firstName":"Qingwu","lastName":"Gong","id":"37341058900"},{"name":"Chuanye Yin","affiliation":["Wuhan Electric Power Technical College, China"],"firstName":"Chuanye","lastName":"Yin","id":"37591457000"},{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan Electric Power Technical College, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37577279200"},{"name":"Jingsong Yao","affiliation":["Hubei EHV Transmission and Substation Company, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jingsong","lastName":"Yao","id":"37600045000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5629897","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629897","abstract":"This paper presents an Elman neural network based on Genetic algorithms for the identification of dynamic equivalents of power system. The Elman neural network is one of the dynamic recurrent neural networks. In this paper, a modified Elman network is introduced first. Then we propose its training algorithm using Genetic algorithms. Lastly, the proposed method is demonstrated and compared with the original system using the 9 machines 36 buses EPRI test system. Simulation results show that the Elman network based on GAs can achieve favorable effects on the application of dynamic equivalents of power system.","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.98","startPage":"376","endPage":"379","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05629897.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Elman Neural Network Application on Dynamic Equivalents of Power System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Power system dynamics","Training","Gallium","Heuristic algorithms","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power engineering computing","power systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Elman neural network","dynamic equivalents","power system","genetic algorithm","identification","dynamic recurrent neural networks","modified Elman network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elman neural network","dynamic equivalents","system identification","Genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5629897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Elman Neural Network Application on Dynamic Equivalents of Power System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5629897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11647489","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Elman Neural Network Application on Dynamic Equivalents of Power System","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047748S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5629897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
