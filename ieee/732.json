It is directly related to the formation of new long-term declarative memory. The malfunction of the hippocampus closely relates to various disease and pathological conditions. It is also a model structure for the study of cortical function and synaptic plasticity in general because of its special neuro-anatomical structure and intrinsic connections within the hippocampus formation. Both the understanding of roles that the hippocampus plays in recognition memory and the study of neural plasticity require simultaneously recording of neural activities from multiple sub-regions of the hippocampus from behavioral animals. However the distribution of cells in the hippocampus make the recording from multiple sub-regions a big challenge with the traditional uni-length micro-wire arrays. Well-designed electrode arrays are required to reach multiple regions simultaneously because of the distinctive double C shape of the hippocampus cell body layers. In this work, we designed a multi-shanks electrode which uses Parylene C, a highly biocompatible and flexible polymer, as a base and has multiple recording sites specially positioned along the longitudinal axis to fit the curvy shape of the rat hippocampus.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320038","startPage":"7139","endPage":"7142","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07320038.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a flexible parylene-based multi-electrode array for multi-region recording from the rat hippocampus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of a flexible parylene-based multi-electrode array for multi-region recording from the rat hippocampus","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320038/","accessionNumber":"15584363","pubMedId":"26737938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320038/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a flexible parylene-based multi-electrode array for multi-region recording from the rat hippocampus","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"18792371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047981S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320054,"authors":[{"name":"Bryan J.

However, these systems fail to provide a medical explanation for the diagnosis. This makes the dermatologists unsure about their use, since they are not easy to understand. In this paper we propose a CAD system that extracts a clinically inspired color description of the lesion and then, uses this information to discriminate melanomas from benign lesions. The proposed system is also capable of showing the extracted color features, making the system and its decisions more comprehensible for practitioners. The development of this system is hampered by the lack of a database of detailed annotate dermoscopy images. Nonetheless, we are able to tackle this issue using an image annotation framework based on the Correspondence-LDA algorithm. This method is applied with success to the identification of relevant colors in dermoscopy images, obtaining an average Precision of 84.9% and a Recall of 85.5%. The proposed color representation is then used to classify skin lesions, resulting in a Sensitivity of 78.9% and Specificity of 76.7%, these values are promising and comparable with the state-of-the art.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320117","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07320117.pdf","startPage":"7462","endPage":"7465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A clinically oriented system for melanoma diagnosis using a color representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320117/","displayDocTitle":"A clinically oriented system for melanoma diagnosis using a color representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584546","pubMedId":"26738017","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320117/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clinically oriented system for melanoma diagnosis using a color representation","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"22342193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050468S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320124,"authors":[{"name":"Congzhi Wang","affiliation":["Paul C.

Several novel beamforming methods based on compressive sensing (CS) theory have been proposed in previous literatures, but all have their own limitations, such as the excessively large memory consumption and the errors caused by the short-time discrete Fourier transform (STDFT). In this study, a novel CS-based time-domain beamformer for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is proposed and its image quality has been verified to be better than the traditional DAS method and even the popular coherent compounding method on several simulated phantoms. Comparing to the existing CS method, the memory consumption of our method is significantly reduced since the encoding matrix can be sparse-expressed. In addition, the time-delay calculations of the echo signals are directly accomplished in time-domain with a dictionary concept, avoiding the errors induced by the short-time Fourier translation calculation in those frequency-domain methods. The proposed method can be easily implemented on some low-cost hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with both high frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great potential for clinical application.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07320124.pdf","startPage":"7490","endPage":"7493","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An easily-achieved time-domain beamformer for ultrafast ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Image quality","Scattering","Mathematical model","Phantoms","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","compressed sensing","discrete Fourier transforms","medical image processing","phantoms","sparse matrices","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrafast ultrasound imaging technique","compressive sensing theory","short-time discrete Fourier transform","CS-based time-domain beamformer","plane-wave ultrasound imaging","image quality","DAS method","coherent compounding method","phantoms","sparse-expressed encoding matrix","frequency-domain methods","low-cost hardware platforms","clinical application"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Phantoms, Imaging","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An easily-achieved time-domain beamformer for ultrafast ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320124/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585024","pubMedId":"26738024","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An easily-achieved time-domain beamformer for ultrafast ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"22410700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059128S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320127,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Valvano","affiliation":["CNR-Regione Toscana, Pisa, PI, Italy","Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, PI, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Valvano","id":"37085666631"},{"name":"Nicola Martini","affiliation":["CNR-Regione Toscana, Pisa, PI, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Martini","id":"37085674734"},{"name":"Maria Filomena Santarelli","affiliation":["CNR-Regione Toscana, Pisa, PI, Italy","CNR, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa, PI, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria Filomena","lastName":"Santarelli","id":"37063354400"},{"name":"Dante Chiappino","affiliation":["CNR-Regione Toscana, Pisa, PI, Italy"],"firstName":"Dante","lastName":"Chiappino","id":"37085665833"},{"name":"Luigi Landini","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Pisa, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Landini","id":"37266426800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7320127","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"In this work we propose a novel acquisition strategy for accelerated 3D Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI). This strategy is based on a 3D cartesian sampling with random switching of the frequency encoding direction with other K-space directions. Two 3D sampling strategies are presented. In the first strategy, the frequency encoding direction is randomly switched with one of the two phase encoding directions. In the second strategy, the frequency encoding direction is randomly chosen between all the directions of the K-Space. These strategies can lower the coherence of the acquisition, in order to produce reduced aliasing artifacts and to achieve a better image quality after Compressive Sensing (CS) reconstruction. Furthermore, the proposed strategies can reduce the typical smoothing of CS due to the limited sampling of high frequency locations. We demonstrated by means of simulations that the proposed acquisition strategies outperformed the standard Compressive Sensing acquisition. This results in a better quality of the reconstructed images and in a greater achievable acceleration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Encoding","Three-dimensional displays","Coherence","Acceleration","Image reconstruction","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D Cartesian random sampling strategy","3D compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging","3D CS-MRI","frequency encoding direction","K-space direction","phase encoding direction","image quality","compressive sensing reconstruction","compressive sensing acquisition","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320127","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07320127.pdf","startPage":"7502","endPage":"7505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel 3D Cartesian random sampling strategy for Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel 3D Cartesian random sampling strategy for Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320127/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320127/","accessionNumber":"15585198","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","pubMedId":"26738027","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel 3D Cartesian random sampling strategy for Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"22440380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045591S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7320129,"authors":[{"name":"David Tsai","affiliation":["Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37589131100"},{"name":"Esha John","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, US"],"firstName":"Esha","lastName":"John","id":"37085612329"},{"name":"Tarun Chari","affiliation":["Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tarun","lastName":"Chari","id":"37085456297"},{"name":"Rafael Yuste","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Yuste","id":"38075722400"},{"name":"Kenneth Shepard","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Shepard","id":"37273513800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7320129","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"abstract":"We present a system for large-scale electrophysiological recording and stimulation of neural tissue with a planar topology.

To resolve limitations of conventional computing methods, several alternative high performance computing solutions have been proposed by scientists such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The latter have shown to be efficient and high in performance. In recent years, FPGAs have been benefiting from dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) feature for adding flexibility to alter specific regions within the chip. This work proposes combing the use of FPGAs and DPR to build a dynamic multi-classifier architecture that can be used in processing bioinformatics data. In bioinformatics, applying different classification algorithms to the same dataset is desirable in order to obtain comparable, more reliable and consensus decision, but it can consume long time when performed on conventional PC. The DPR implementation of two common classifiers, namely support vector machines (SVMs) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) are combined together to form a multi-classifier FPGA architecture which can utilize specific region of the FPGA to work as either SVM or KNN classifier. This multi-classifier DPR implementation achieved at least ~8x reduction in reconfiguration time over the single non-DPR classifier implementation, and occupied less space and hardware resources than having both classifiers. The proposed architecture can be extended to work as an ensemble classifier.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320168","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07320168.pdf","startPage":"7667","endPage":"7670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic partial reconfiguration implementation of the SVM/KNN multi-classifier on FPGA for bioinformatics application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic partial reconfiguration implementation of the SVM/KNN multi-classifier on FPGA for bioinformatics application","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320168/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584693","pubMedId":"26738068","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic partial reconfiguration implementation of the SVM/KNN multi-classifier on FPGA for bioinformatics application","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"22861466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044438S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320243,"authors":[{"name":"Praful P.

A photoacoustic (PA) measurement apparatus was constructed and PA measurements were made on glucose solutions at multiple NIR excitation wavelengths. A variety of time and frequency domain features, including amplitude and area based features, were extracted from the PA measurements. These features were observed to be proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample. PA measurements from samples of whole blood at different glucose concentrations showed similar results. Subsequently, in vivo PA measurements made on a cohort of 30 volunteers were calibrated using a quadratic fit, and the results were compared to reference glucose concentrations made using a regular blood glucose meter. A comparison of 196 measurement pairs of predicted and reference glucose concentrations using a Clarke Error Grid gave a point distribution of 87.24% and 12.76% over zones A and B of the grid, with no measurement pairs falling in unacceptable zones C-E of the error grid. The predicted measurements had a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 12.57 \u00b1 13.90 mg/dl and a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 9.61% \u00b1 10.55%. This is an improvement over previous results obtained using PAS and other non-invasive techniques, validating the potential of PAS for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15584029","htmlLink":"/document/7320243/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","pubMedId":"26738143","displayDocTitle":"NIR photoacoustic spectroscopy for non-invasive glucose measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NIR photoacoustic spectroscopy for non-invasive glucose measurement","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"23611071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064622S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7320243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7320403,"authors":[{"name":"Chetan Arora","affiliation":["SnT Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Chetan","lastName":"Arora","id":"37085469434"},{"name":"Mehrdad Sabetzadeh","affiliation":["SnT Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Sabetzadeh","id":"37320349400"},{"name":"Arda Goknil","affiliation":["SnT Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Arda","lastName":"Goknil","id":"38481513500"},{"name":"Lionel C.

Changing one requirement in a requirements specification may warrant further changes to the specification, so that the overall correctness and consistency of the specification can be maintained. A manual analysis of how a change to one requirement impacts other requirements is time-consuming and presents a challenge for large requirements specifications. We propose an approach based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing the impact of change in Natural Language (NL) requirements. Our focus on NL requirements is motivated by the prevalent use of these requirements, particularly in industry. Our approach automatically detects and takes into account the phrasal structure of requirements statements. We argue about the importance of capturing the conditions under which change should propagate to enable more accurate change impact analysis. We propose a quantitative measure for calculating how likely a requirements statement is to be impacted by a change under given conditions. We conduct an evaluation of our approach by applying it to 14 change scenarios from two industrial case studies.","doi":"10.1109/RE.2015.7320403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2015.7320403","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310793/7320393/07320403.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Change impact analysis for Natural Language requirements: An NLP approach","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15574728","htmlLink":"/document/7320403/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change impact analysis for Natural Language requirements: An NLP approach","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p6arora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094789S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310793","isNumber":"7320393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310793","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7320393","articleId":"7320403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320415,"authors":[{"name":"Garm Lucassen","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Garm","lastName":"Lucassen","id":"37085405817"},{"name":"Fabiano Dalpiaz","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Fabiano","lastName":"Dalpiaz","id":"37889384000"},{"name":"Jan Martijn E.M. van der Werf","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jan Martijn E.M.","lastName":"van der Werf","id":"37395880700"},{"name":"Sjaak Brinkkemper","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sjaak","lastName":"Brinkkemper","id":"37283881600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6905-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6904-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-705X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6441"}],"articleNumber":"7320415","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1748},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forging high-quality User Stories: Towards a discipline for Agile Requirements","abstract":"User stories are a widely used notation for formulating requirements in agile development projects.

When gathering requirements, one concern is whether the requirements are too incomplete to account for every possible, unintended, off-nominal behavior (ONB) that the operating environment can create in the system. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach, based on the causal component model (CCM), which can expose, within a set of requirements, whether ONBs can result in undesired system states. We demonstrate how the CCM approach exposes and helps address potential off-nominal behavior problems in a set of requirements that represents a real-world product. Our case study shows that the approach can expose susceptibility to ONBs and can supply information in correcting requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320416/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15574705","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320416/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exposing the susceptibility of off-nominal behaviors in reactive system requirements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exposing the susceptibility of off-nominal behaviors in reactive system requirements","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p136aceituna.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069947S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310793","isNumber":"7320393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310793","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7320393","articleId":"7320416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7320424,"authors":[{"name":"David Ameller","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ameller","id":"37591284100"},{"name":"Xavier Franch","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Franch","id":"37267427200"},{"name":"Cristina G\u00f3mez","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"G\u00f3mez","id":"37595165700"},{"name":"Joao Araujo","affiliation":["NOVA LINCS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Araujo","id":"37272009800"},{"name":"Richard Berntsson Svensson","affiliation":["Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Richard Berntsson","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37406265400"},{"name":"Stefan Biffl","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Biffl","id":"37271737500"},{"name":"Jordi Cabot","affiliation":["ICREA - UOC, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Cabot","id":"37316517800"},{"name":"Vittorio Cortellessa","affiliation":["University of L\u2019 Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Cortellessa","id":"37278781400"},{"name":"Maya Daneva","affiliation":["University of Twente, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Daneva","id":"37266182300"},{"name":"Daniel M\u00e9ndez Fern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Daniel M\u00e9ndez","lastName":"Fern\u00e1ndez","id":"38230824000"},{"name":"Ana Moreira","affiliation":["NOVA LINCS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Moreira","id":"37306317600"},{"name":"Henry Muccini","affiliation":["University of L\u2019 Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Muccini","id":"37550021900"},{"name":"Antonio Vallecillo","affiliation":["Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Vallecillo","id":"37282721100"},{"name":"Manuel Wimmer","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Wimmer","id":"37297155200"},{"name":"Vasco Amaral","affiliation":["NOVA LINCS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Vasco","lastName":"Amaral","id":"37278706900"},{"name":"Hugo Bruneli\u00e8re","affiliation":["AtlanMod Team (Inria, Mines Nantes & LINA), France"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Bruneli\u00e8re","id":"38193710500"},{"name":"Loli Burgue\u00f1o","affiliation":["Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Spain"],"firstName":"Loli","lastName":"Burgue\u00f1o","id":"37085533803"},{"name":"Miguel Goul\u00e3o","affiliation":["NOVA LINCS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Goul\u00e3o","id":"37331301100"},{"name":"Bernhard Sch\u00e4tz","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sch\u00e4tz","id":"37424876900"},{"name":"Sabine Teufl","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Teufl","id":"38015584000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6905-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6904-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-705X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6441"}],"articleNumber":"7320424","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"abstract":"Model-Driven Development (MDD) is no longer a novel development paradigm. It has become mature from a research perspective and recent studies show its adoption in industry. Still, some issues remain a challenge. Among them, we are interested in the treatment of non-functional requirements (NFRs) in MDD processes. Very few MDD approaches have been reported to deal with NFRs (and they do it in a limited way). However, it is clear that NFRs need to be considered somehow in the final product of the MDD process. To better understand how NFRs are integrated into the existing MDD approaches, we have initiated the NFR4MDD project, a multi-national empirical study, based on interviews with companies working on MDD projects. Our project aims at surveying the state of the practice for this topic. In this paper, we summarize our research protocol and present the current status of our study. The discussion will focus on the peculiarities of our study's context and organization involving about 20 researchers from 8 European countries.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Companies","Interviews","Sociology","Statistics","Context","Protocols","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonfunctional requirements","model-driven development","industrial survey","NFR4MDD project","multinational empirical study"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-Functional Requirements","Model-Driven Development","Quality Requirements","NFR","MDD","Empirical Study","Survey","Semi-Structured Interviews"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RE.2015.7320424","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310793/7320393/07320424.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2015.7320424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling non-functional requirements in Model-Driven Development: An ongoing industrial survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Handling non-functional requirements in Model-Driven Development: An ongoing industrial survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320424/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320424/","accessionNumber":"15574719","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling non-functional requirements in Model-Driven Development: An ongoing industrial survey","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p208ameller.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133827S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310793","isNumber":"7320393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310793","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7320393","articleId":"7320424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320480,"authors":[{"name":"Rajan Miglani","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, LPU, INDIA"],"firstName":"Rajan","lastName":"Miglani","id":"37085634479"},{"name":"Jagjit Singh Malhotra","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, DAVIET, INDIA"],"firstName":"Jagjit Singh","lastName":"Malhotra","id":"37085654794"},{"name":"Gurjot Singh Gaba","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, LPU, INDIA"],"firstName":"Gurjot Singh","lastName":"Gaba","id":"38241343700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7626-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7625-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7624-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-8488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-847X"}],"articleNumber":"7320480","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"In this paper experimental verification of optical fiber based parametric amplification has been studied over different modulation formats. Based on principle of parametric amplification, which is essentially a non linear phenomena, these fiber amplifiers offer discrete amplification along with greater use of bandwidth without any major compromise on usable gain and vice versa. We have demonstrated the gain profile of fiber optical parametric amplifier using SBS (Stimulated Brillouin Scattering) control mechanism which is based on SBS power pump, which in turn determines the gain of lumped amplifier. Different modulation formats like amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and phase modulation were investigated, both with and without the parametric amplification over given length of fiber. During performance evaluation it was observed that FM and PM modulated data responded with considerable increase in gain with activation of SBS pump, while the similar gain improvement was found to be missing in AM modulated data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Scattering","Optical fiber dispersion","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre amplifiers","optical parametric amplifiers","stimulated Brillouin scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain profile analysis","fiber optical parametric amplifiers","SBS","parametric amplification","nonlinear phenomena","stimulated Brillouin scattering","amplitude modulation","frequency modulation","phase modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA)","Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS)","Nonlinear fiber optics","Optical phase matching","Gain profile of modulation formats"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FOAN.2015.7320480","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Fiber Optics in Access Network (FOAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Fiber Optics in Access Network (FOAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313078/7318284/07320480.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOAN.2015.7320480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain profile analysis in fiber optical parametric amplifiers using SBS technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gain profile analysis in fiber optical parametric amplifiers using SBS technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320480/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320480/","accessionNumber":"15574766","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain profile analysis in fiber optical parametric amplifiers using SBS technique","confLoc":"Brno, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"p56-miglani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040521S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313078","isNumber":"7318284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313078","xplore-issue":"7318284","articleId":"7320480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320516,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Rodrigues Torres Neto","affiliation":["Instituto de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o(IC) Universidade Estadual de Campinas(UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brasil"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodrigues Torres Neto","id":"37085635861"},{"name":"Daniel Ludovico Guidoni","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei(UFSJ) S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, MG, Brasil"],"firstName":"Daniel Ludovico","lastName":"Guidoni","id":"37545828900"},{"name":"Jo Ueyama","affiliation":["Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas e de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo(USP), S\u00e3o Carlos, SP, Brasil"],"firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Ueyama","id":"37397936400"},{"name":"Leandro A.

This activity is done manually and can provide error and cause financial and physical losses. Solutions have been proposed in the literature focusing on more efficient routes for meter readers or the use of a car to perform the task remotely, which can increase the cost and have delayed task by problems of transit traffic. To overcome these challenges and constraints, we propose an architecture to automatic meter reading (AMR) system using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Two main contributions can be absorbed of this solution: i) the meter readers are no longer needed; ii) reducing the time and distance to carry out the collection of the readings from the power meters. In addition a protocol that ensures wireless communication between the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and the power meters was designed. The solution was validated and evaluated in an urban environment and the results achieved show a decrease up to 72.6% of time and 45.1% of the distance as compared to the use a car. The communication protocol can avoid at least 98.3% of packet collisions.","doi":"10.1109/SBRC.2015.21","publicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7317885/7320494/07320516.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRC.2015.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Solution to perform Automatic Meter Reading using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Solution to perform Automatic Meter Reading using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15586181","htmlLink":"/document/7320516/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Solution to perform Automatic Meter Reading using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7767a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064804S","chronDate":"18-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317885","isNumber":"7320494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317885","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7320494","articleId":"7320516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7320522,"authors":[{"name":"Thiago Kenji Okada","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thiago Kenji","lastName":"Okada","id":"37085654678"},{"name":"Albert De La Fuente Vigliotti","affiliation":["Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, BR"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"De La Fuente Vigliotti","id":"37085398162"},{"name":"Daniel Mac\u00eado Batista","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Mac\u00eado","lastName":"Batista","id":"37597317800"},{"name":"Alfredo Goldman vel Lejbman","affiliation":["Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, BR"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Goldman vel Lejbman","id":"37087467504"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7767-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7320522","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"Improvement of energy efficiency in IT is an important research topic nowadays. The reduction of operational costs, generated heat and environment impact are some of the reasons for this. Thanks to the advent of cloud computing, it is possible to improve energy efficiency in data centers by running various virtual machines in a single physical machine. However, the cloud providers generally invest in performance, not energy efficiency. This paper focuses on the problem of an energy efficient initial VM placement, and describes three new algorithms for this problem, one based on the First Fit Decreasing algorithm, and the other two based on the Best Fit Decreasing algorithm. They are compared with other algorithms in the literature, and a reduction of power consumption up to 3.24% was observed, as well a reduction of execution time in several orders of magnitude. Scripts used to analyze traces publicly provided by Google are another contribution of the paper, since they are useful for those working in mechanisms for cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7317885/7320494/07320522.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/SBRC.2015.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRC.2015.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consolidation of VMs to Improve Energy Efficiency in Cloud Computing Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Google","Power demand","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Energy consumption","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cost reduction","power aware computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VM consolidation","energy efficiency","cloud computing environments","IT","operational cost reduction","virtual machines","single physical machine","first fit decreasing algorithm","best fit decreasing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","green computing","virtual machine","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Consolidation of VMs to Improve Energy Efficiency in Cloud Computing Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15574780","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consolidation of VMs to Improve Energy Efficiency in Cloud Computing Environments","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7767a150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079501S","chronDate":"18-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317885","isNumber":"7320494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317885","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7320494","articleId":"7320522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320534,"authors":[{"name":"Otto Julio Ahlert Pinno","affiliation":["Instituto de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, GO, BR"],"firstName":"Otto Julio","lastName":"Ahlert Pinno","id":"37088466964"},{"name":"Sand Luz Correa","affiliation":["Instituto de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, Brasil"],"firstName":"Sand Luz","lastName":"Correa","id":"37587271100"},{"name":"Aldri Luiz dos Santos","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, PR, BR"],"firstName":"Aldri Luiz","lastName":"dos Santos","id":"38186149000"},{"name":"Kleber Vieira Cardoso","affiliation":["Instituto de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, Brasil"],"firstName":"Kleber Vieira","lastName":"Cardoso","id":"37993291000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7767-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7320534","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yttrium","Monitoring","Correlation","Servers","Biomedical monitoring","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metric selection","MST-PCTN","PCTN-MST","partial correlation","anomaly detection","multitier systems","e-commerce","Web transaction benchmark","monitoring network","fault coverage","data centers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Correlation","Partial Correlation","Metric Selection"]}],"abstract":"Large-scale data centers allow organizations to gain access to computer resources without incurring high costs in purchasing and maintaining IT infrastructure. In these environments, due to the large number of hardware and software involved, anomaly detection is difficult but essential for service provisioning. Computer systems hosted in data centers usually involve multiple layers and provide a large set of metrics for tracking their operation. The analysis of all available metrics generates drawbacks associated with communication, storage and processing. A more efficient way to support anomaly detection and minimize the cost of monitoring is to use stable statistical correlations among metrics that reflect the system state. We present the strategies PCTN, MST-PCTN and PCTN-MST, based on partial correlation, for selecting metrics to support anomaly detection in multi-tier systems. We evaluate the proposed strategies using an e-commerce, Web transaction benchmark. Results show that the PCTN-MST strategy allowed the construction of a monitoring network with 8% less metrics than that obtained with MST and achieved a fault coverage up to 10% larger.","doi":"10.1109/SBRC.2015.39","publicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7317885/7320494/07320534.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRC.2015.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Partial Correlation for Effective Metric Selection and Anomaly Detection in Multi-tier System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320534/","displayDocTitle":"Using Partial Correlation for Effective Metric Selection and Anomaly Detection in Multi-tier System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15574777","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320534/","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Partial Correlation for Effective Metric Selection and Anomaly Detection in Multi-tier System","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7767a269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057888S","chronDate":"18-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317885","isNumber":"7320494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317885","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7320494","articleId":"7320534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320596,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Under the multi-agent control strategy microgrid energy storage systems communicate over a sparse communication network and adjust their output powers so that they approach a balanced state of charge, while regulating the microgrid frequency and voltage. The proposed control strategy provides a robustness condition for balanced communication topologies with uniform communication delays. The robustness condition depends only on the individual energy storage system dynamics and is thus scalable to microgrids with many ES systems. It is shown that the structure of the proposed control strategy preserves the normal synchronous frequency of the droop controlled microgrid, so frequency regulation is not affected. Simulations are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed control strategy for an AC microgrid with variable PV generation and energy storage systems connected by a sparse communication network with communication delays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320630.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication delay robustness for multi-agent state of charge balancing between distributed AC microgrid storage systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Delays","Batteries","Power generation","Communication networks","Frequency control","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","energy storage","power grids","power system control","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["droop controlled AC microgrids","variable PV generation","sparse communication network","energy storage systems","distributed AC microgrid storage systems","state-of-charge balancing","multi-agent control strategy","communication delay robustness condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Communication delay robustness for multi-agent state of charge balancing between distributed AC microgrid storage systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583970","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication delay robustness for multi-agent state of charge balancing between distributed AC microgrid storage systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"0075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082492S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302355","isNumber":"7320604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302355","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7320604","articleId":"7320630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320636,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Y.

The main issue with multi-dof manipulators is that their dynamics are configuration dependent. The varying dynamics of the robot is thus taken into account during the optimization process, thereby resulting in a stable controller with exceptionally high performance. Moreover, the coupled stability of the manipulator is assessed with an extended version of the concept of complementary stability which allows to overcome the passivity conditions. Although the optimization proposed here is based on three performance indices specific to bilateral amplification, it can be easily adapted to any type of bilateral interaction. The resulting performance and stability of the optimal controller are demonstrated on a seven-dof serial manipulator with impact tests on different contact surfaces.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320682","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320682.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"526","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance optimization of a multi-DOF bilateral robot force amplification using complementary stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance optimization of a multi-DOF bilateral robot force amplification using complementary stability","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7320682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15574081","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"As originally submitted and published there was an error in this document.

This paper presents the design, analysis, and validation of a new control scheme based on the structure of the traditional Two-Degrees-of-Freedom (2DOF) PID controller. The proposed controller is established based on a linear continuous input-output nominal model, and presents a simple structure composed by two second order transfer functions. Despite its simplicity, the controller studied in this paper is able to achieve zero error in the tracking of ramp input signals and, therefore, in the slopes of triangular signals, typically used in nanopositioning applications to trace a raster pattern. The controller also suppresses the unmodeled nonlinearities of the piezoelectric actuated nanopositioning systems without the need of an hysteresis model or a state observer. Moreover, the stability of the control system is proved, and its effectiveness is validated through experimental chattering-free control on a piezoelectric stack-actuated nanopositioning platform. Results demonstrate that the proposed controller is superior to the conventional polynomial-based, proportional-integral, and resonant controllers proposed in literature for motion-tracking tasks in nanopositioning systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320714","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320714.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"797","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-degrees-of-freedom controller delivering zero-error tracking of ramp-like trajectories for nanopositioning systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Two-degrees-of-freedom controller delivering zero-error tracking of ramp-like trajectories for nanopositioning systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7320714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15574263","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320714/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-degrees-of-freedom controller delivering zero-error tracking of ramp-like trajectories for nanopositioning systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"0025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049826S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302355","isNumber":"7320604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302355","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7320604","articleId":"7320714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320733,"authors":[{"name":"Xianwei Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085681600"},{"name":"Fazel Naghdy","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Fazel","lastName":"Naghdy","id":"37330670500"},{"name":"Haiping Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Haiping","lastName":"Du","id":"37395441600"},{"name":"Golshah Naghdy","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Golshah","lastName":"Naghdy","id":"37285115200"},{"name":"Catherine Todd","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Todd","id":"37410104100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7786-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"7320733","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320733","abstract":"Recent neural science research suggests that a robotic device can be an effective tool to deliver the repetitive movement training that is needed to trigger neuroplasticity in the brain following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI).

aerial vehicles (UAVs). The accretion of ice layers on wings and control surfaces modifies the shape of the aircraft and alters the performance and controllability of the vehicles. The correct detection of this phenomenon is of paramount importance for the efficient implementation of de-icing techniques. The advantage of deriving the unknown input observer within the LPV framework is the possibility to deal with the nonlinearities of the UAV model by embedding them within some varying parameters. Results obtained with a Zagi Flying Wing simulator are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320740","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320740.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Icing detection in unmanned aerial vehicles with longitudinal motion using an LPV unknown input observer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320740/","displayDocTitle":"Icing detection in unmanned aerial vehicles with longitudinal motion using an LPV unknown input observer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583974","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320740/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Icing detection in unmanned aerial vehicles with longitudinal motion using an LPV unknown input observer","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"0258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05594S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302355","isNumber":"7320604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302355","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7320604","articleId":"7320740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7320787,"authors":[{"name":"Younes Al Younes","affiliation":["University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France","Mechanical Engineering Faculty, Higher Colleges of Technology, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Younes Al","lastName":"Younes","id":"37085358665"},{"name":"Hassan Noura","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Noura","id":"37300869700"},{"name":"Abdelhamid Rabhi","affiliation":["Control & Vehicle Group, University of Picardie, Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Rabhi","id":"37427941600"},{"name":"Ahmed El Hajjaji","affiliation":["Control & Vehicle Group, University of Picardie, Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed El","lastName":"Hajjaji","id":"37393178200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7786-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"7320787","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Decision support systems","Conferences","Australia","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","compensation","estimation theory","helicopters","MIMO systems","mobile robots","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-free observer design","MFO","multiinput-multioutput system","MIMO system","compensation","output estimation technique","quadrotor UAV"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel observer design is introduced to estimate the outputs of a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) system.

The novelty consists in the simultaneous use of envelope time-of-flight (ETF) and carrier phase (CPH) measurements. In particular, we establish a two-channel link consisting of an ultrasound and infrared channel, the latter using a carrier frequency equal to the ultrasound frequency. In order to render the system extendible for multiple transmitters and receivers, code-division-multiple-access using Gold codes is employed, as all ultrasound and infrared signals share the same carrier frequency. This is also beneficial for multipath scattering suppression. The time difference between the carrier phase of the received ultrasound and infrared signals offers a high resolution but ambiguous distance signal. On the other hand, correlation of the received signals yields a coarse but unique distance signal. Experimental results show that a measurement resolution in the submillimeter range is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320817","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1466","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320817.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opto-acoustic distance measurement using spread spectrum techniques and carrier phase measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Opto-acoustic distance measurement using spread spectrum techniques and carrier phase measurements","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320817/","accessionNumber":"15574132","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320817/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opto-acoustic distance measurement using spread spectrum techniques and carrier phase measurements","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"0313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085834S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302355","isNumber":"7320604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302355","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7320604","articleId":"7320817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320848,"authors":[{"name":"K Arun Kumar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"firstName":"K Arun","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37087903165"},{"name":"Shubhendu Bhasin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shubhendu","lastName":"Bhasin","id":"37392052500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7786-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"7320848","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Stability analysis","Yttrium","Adaptation models","Adaptive control","Estimation error","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","learning systems","model reference adaptive control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven MRAC","parameter convergence","model reference adaptive control","restrictive persistence of excitation condition","PE condition","data driven approach","concurrent learning","input-output data","standard adaptive laws","state derivative estimator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320848","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2015.7320848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2015.7320848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320604","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302355/7320604/07320848.pdf","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven MRAC with parameter convergence","abstract":"The convergence of parameters in model reference adaptive control (MRAC) requires that a restrictive persistence of excitation (PE) condition be satisfied.

The Vcm-based switching method is adopted for coarse conversion to reduce DAC power and maintain common mode. The residual voltage after coarse conversion is converted to time domain, and the fine TDC detects the least three bits with 0.5 bit redundancy by using a Vernier delay structure.

structure in visible light communication (VLC) systems equipped with red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to provide tools for performance analysis and to give guidelines for practical designs. Specifically, the protograph-based low-density parity-check (P-LDPC) codes and the optimized generalized variable degree matched mapping interleavers are applied to VLC systems for the first time. To theoretically analyze the system under concern, we utilize the protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) methodology that can accurately predict error performance. Furthermore, by leveraging this powerful analysis tool, we propose optimizing a VLC system from three perspectives, i.e., the interleaver design, the optimization of the power mixing ratio of RGB color lights, and the selection of coding schemes. Both PEXIT analyses and simulations verify that the performance of a VLC system can be greatly improved by optimizing these three components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"7","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15615633","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7320948/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"externalId":"7905213","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of P-LDPC Coded RGB-LED-Based VLC Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61223001 and 61501110"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu, China","grantNumber":"BK20150635"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2015B02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis and Optimization of P-LDPC Coded RGB-LED-Based VLC Systems","sourcePdf":"jphot-tang-2498541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105577S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7305892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7305892","articleId":"7320948","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7320953,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Cost-effective wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) transceiver architectures, achieving high information spectral densities (ISDs) (>1 b/s/Hz) and using low-complexity direct detection receivers are attractive solutions for such links. In this paper, we assess the use of dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulators (DD-MZMs), and compare them with in-phase quadrature (IQ)-modulators for generating spectrally-efficient single sideband Nyquist pulse-shaped 16-QAM subcarrier (N-SCM) modulation format signals. The impact of the extinction ratio (ER) of a modulator on the optical sideband suppression ratio (OSSR) was investigated for the SSB signals in WDM systems, together with the resulting impact on inter-channel crosstalk penalties. First, in back-to-back operation, an IQ-modulator with an ER of 30 dB and a DD-MZM with an ER of 18 dB were experimentally compared in a 6\u00d725 Gb/s WDM system by varying the channel spacing. Following this comparison, 16 GHz-spaced 6\u00d725 Gb/s WDM signal transmission was experimentally demonstrated using the DD-MZM. The experiment was performed using a recirculating loop with uncompensated standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) and EDFA-only amplification. The maximum achievable transmission distances for single channel and WDM signals were found to be 565 and 242 km, respectively, at a net optical ISD of 1.5 b/s/Hz. This is the first experimental comparison of such modulator types for SSB N-SCM signal generation and the highest achieved ISD using a DD-MZM in direct-detection WDM transmission.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2497343","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1165","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2497343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404301","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7404301/07320953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally Efficient WDM Nyquist Pulse-Shaped Subcarrier Modulation Using a Dual-Drive Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulator and Direct Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320953/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectrally Efficient WDM Nyquist Pulse-Shaped Subcarrier Modulation Using a Dual-Drive Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulator and Direct Detection","volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7320953/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15798985","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU ERA-NET+ project PIANO+ IMPACT"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC UNLOC","grantNumber":"EP/J017582/1"},{"fundingName":"ASTRON","grantNumber":"EU FP7"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally Efficient WDM Nyquist Pulse-Shaped Subcarrier Modulation Using a Dual-Drive Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulator and Direct Detection","sourcePdf":"jlt-erkilinc-2497343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089289S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7404301","articleId":"7320953","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7320959,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon Pires","affiliation":["Institute of Computing, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Pires","orcid":"0000-0002-0023-1971","id":"38469647600"},{"name":"Sandra Avila","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computing Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Avila","id":"37084077200"},{"name":"Herbert F.

Automated DR screening helps by indicating which patients should be referred to the doctor. However, current techniques of automated screening still depend too much on the detection of individual lesions. In this study, we bypass lesion detection, and directly train a classifier for DR referral. Additional novelties are the use of state-of-the-art mid-level features for the retinal images: BossaNova and Fisher Vector. Those features extend the classical Bags of Visual Words and greatly improve the accuracy of complex classification tasks. The proposed technique for direct referral is promising, achieving an area under the curve of 96.4%, thus, reducing the classification error by almost 40% over the current state of the art, held by lesion-based techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Retinopathy","Retina","Diabetes","Detectors","Feature extraction","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","diseases","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lesion based diabetic retinopathy","blindness","automated DR screening","DR referral classifier","BossaNova","Fisher Vector","Bags of Visual Words"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bag of visual words","bossanova","diabetic retinopathy","direct referral","fisher vector","referability","referral"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diabetic Retinopathy","Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Referral and Consultation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2498104","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7839252/07320959.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2498104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Lesion-Based Diabetic Retinopathy: A Direct Approach for Referral","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beyond Lesion-Based Diabetic Retinopathy: A Direct Approach for Referral","accessionNumber":"16638868","pubMedId":"26561488","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","volume":"21","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320959/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Microsoft Research, S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp) under Grant MSR-Fapesp","grantNumber":"2008/54443-2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001807","fundingName":"Fapesp","grantNumber":"2010/05647-4"},{"fundingName":"Amazon Web Services, and Samsung Electronics of Amazon"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Lesion-Based Diabetic Retinopathy: A Direct Approach for Referral","sourcePdf":"jbhi-pires-2498104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097273S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7320959","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320962,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Lyu","affiliation":["Wind Power Research Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7394954/7320962/lyu-2498182-small.gif","p":["Jing Lyu (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","He was a Ph.D. Visiting Scholar with the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, in 2015.

Resonances or instability phenomena have been reported in between wind farms and MMC-HVdc systems. They are arguably originated due to interactions between the MMC and the wind power inverters. However, the nature of these interactions is neither well understood nor reported in the literature. In this paper, the impedance-based analytical approach is applied to analyze the stability and to predict the phase margin of the interconnected system. For that, analytical impedance models of a three-phase MMC in a compensated modulation case and a direct modulation case are separately derived using the small-signal frequency domain method. Moreover, the impedance models of the MMC take the circulating current control into account. The derived impedance models are then verified by comparing the frequency responses of the analytical model with the impedance measured in a nonlinear time-domain simulation model developed in MATLAB. The results show that the potential resonances or instability of the interconnected system can be readily predicted through the Nyquist diagrams. In addition, the analysis indicates that the circulating current control of the MMC has a significant impact on the stability of the interconnected system.

In this paper, we propose an omnidirectional precoding (OP) based transmission for public channels in massive MIMO systems, which leads to a significant reduction in the downlink pilot overhead while providing omnidirectional signaling. For this OP based transmission, we present three necessary conditions that the OP matrix should satisfy, to meet the requirements for omnidirectional transmission for reliable cell-wide coverage, equal average power on each antenna to sufficiently utilize all the available power amplifier capacities of BS antennas, and achievable ergodic rate maximization for the i.i.d. channel, respectively. Then, several examples of the OP matrix satisfying the three necessary conditions simultaneously are designed by utilizing the Zadoff-Chu sequence and its properties. We also analyze the system performance in terms of achievable ergodic rate, outage probability, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for these designs. It is shown that a dedicated design of the OP matrix has the following advantages: 1) it asymptotically maximizes the achievable ergodic rate, maximizes the achievable diversity order, and minimizes the outage probability in the large-scale array regime, not only for the i.i.d. channel, but also for spatially correlated channels; 2) it preserves the PAPR of the transmitted signal after precoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07320968.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidirectional Precoding Based Transmission in Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Omnidirectional Precoding Based Transmission in Massive MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320968/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15704891","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320968/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471113, 61320106003 and 61201171"},{"fundingName":"China High-Tech 863 Plan","grantNumber":"2015AA011305 and 2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2014ZX03003006-003"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Cooperation Project"},{"fundingName":"Program for Jiangsu Innovation Team"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omnidirectional Precoding Based Transmission in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gao-2498159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1362S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7320968","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7320973,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hsien Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsien","lastName":"Fang","id":"37274389700"},{"name":"Yi-Chiao Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chiao","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085697830"},{"name":"Yie-Tarng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yie-Tarng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407099200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7320973","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","Harmonic analysis","Source separation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","Monte Carlo methods","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","importance sampling","multidimensional harmonic retrieval problems","iterative estimation","filtering process","Monte Carlo method","Pincus theorem","Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filtering","importance sampling","maximum likelihood","multidimensional harmonic retrieval"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320973","abstract":"This letter addresses a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm for multidimensional (m-D) harmonic retrieval (MHR) problems.

As an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) for OSA diagnosis, the automatic OSA detection methods used in the current practice mainly concentrate on feature extraction and classifier selection based on collected physiological signals. However, one common limitation in these methods is that the temporal dependence of signals are usually ignored, which may result in critical information loss for OSA diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OSA detection approach based on ECG signals by considering temporal dependence within segmented signals. A discriminative hidden Markov model (HMM) and corresponding parameter estimation algorithms are provided. In addition, subject-specific transition probabilities within the model are employed to characterize the subject-to-subject differences of potential OSA patients. To validate our approach, 70 recordings obtained from the Physionet Apnea-ECG database were used. Accuracies of 97.1% for per-recording classification and 86.2% for per-segment OSA detection with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity were achieved. Compared with other existing methods that simply ignore the temporal dependence of signals, the proposed HMM-based detection approach delivers more satisfactory detection performance and could be extended to other disease diagnosis applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7493713/07320974.pdf","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2498199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2498199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection Approach Using a Discriminative Hidden Markov Model From ECG Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hidden Markov models","Electrocardiography","Markov processes","Sleep apnea","Biomedical measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiogram (ECG)","hidden Markov model (HMM)","obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)","temporal dependence"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Humans","Markov Chains","Middle Aged","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","Support Vector Machine"]},{"kwd":["Electrocardiogram (ECG)","hidden Markov model (HMM)","obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)","temporal dependence"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/7493713/7320974-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection Approach Using a Discriminative Hidden Markov Model From ECG Signals","volume":"63","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7320974/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","pubMedId":"26560867","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1362529"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71201002 and 71571003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"An Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection Approach Using a Discriminative Hidden Markov Model From ECG Signals","sourcePdf":"tbme-zhang-2498199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084441S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7493713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7493713","articleId":"7320974","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7320980,"authors":[{"name":"Alice P.

By exploiting the antipodal symmetry property of the diffusion signal in the spectral (spherical harmonic) domain, we design a sampling scheme that attains the optimal number of samples, equal to the degrees of freedom required to represent the antipodally symmetric band-limited diffusion signal in the spectral domain. Compared with other sampling schemes that can be used with the optimal number of samples, we demonstrate, through numerical experiments, that the proposed scheme enables more accurate computation of the SHT, and this accuracy is practically rotationally invariant. In addition, it results in more efficient computation of the SHT and storage of the diffusion signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7314997/07320980.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2498162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2498162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Dimensionality Sampling Scheme on the Sphere with Accurate and Efficient Spherical Harmonic Transform for Diffusion MRI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Spectral analysis","Transforms","Image reconstruction","Antipodal signal","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","medical signal processing","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal dimensionality sampling scheme","spherical harmonic transform","diffusion MRI","diffusion signal measurement","diffusion signal reconstruction","diffusion magnetic resonance imaging","antipodal symmetry property","symmetric band-limited diffusion signal","diffusion signal storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antipodal signal","diffusion magnetic resonance imaging","sampling","sphere","spherical harmonic transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Dimensionality Sampling Scheme on the Sphere with Accurate and Efficient Spherical Harmonic Transform for Diffusion MRI","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7320980/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15583564","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150101011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Dimensionality Sampling Scheme on the Sphere with Accurate and Efficient Spherical Harmonic Transform for Diffusion MRI","sourcePdf":"lsp-bates-2498162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12192S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7314997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7314997","articleId":"7320980","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7320983,"authors":[{"name":"Sreejith Kallummil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sreejith","lastName":"Kallummil","orcid":"0000-0002-1909-716X","id":"37085694346"},{"name":"Sheetal Kalyani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sheetal","lastName":"Kalyani","id":"37298356200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7320983","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"abstract":"Generalized space shift keying (GSSK) proposed for large scale MIMO systems promises significant advantages in terms of hardware costs. However, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection for GSSK is computationally intractable. Detection schemes using compressive sensing (CS) offer a favorable performance-complexity tradeoff. In this letter, we propose a novel GSSK detection framework, where CS algorithms are used to reduce the complexity of ML detection. The proposed framework significantly reduces the performance gap between existing CS-based detection schemes and ML detection while retaining the complexity advantage of CS algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of proposed scheme over popular CS-based detection schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7412801/07320983.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2498165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2498165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining ML and Compressive Sensing: Detection Schemes for Generalized Space Shift Keying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Matching pursuit algorithms","Transmitting antennas","GSM","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","generalized space shift keying","large scale MIMO system","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"kwd":["Compressed sensing","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO systems","space shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combining ML and Compressive Sensing: Detection Schemes for Generalized Space Shift Keying","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7320983/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15802498","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining ML and Compressive Sensing: Detection Schemes for Generalized Space Shift Keying","sourcePdf":"lwc-k-2498165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071616S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7412801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7412801","articleId":"7320983","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7320986,"authors":[{"name":"Antonios Pitarokoilis","affiliation":["Division of Communication Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7320986/pitar-2498163-small.gif","p":["Antonios Pitarokoilis (S\u201915) received the diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from NTUA, Athens, Greece, and the M.Sc. degree in communications systems from TUM, Munich, Germany, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

Furthermore, two different operations with respect to the phase noise sources are considered, namely, the case of identical phase noise sources and the case of independent phase noise sources over the antennas. In all scenarios, the optimal detector is derived for a very general parameterization of the phase noise distribution. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis is performed to show that symbol-error-rate (SER) floors appear in all cases. The SER floor in the case of identical phase noise sources (for both constant and fading channels) is independent of the number of antenna elements. In contrast, the SER floor in the case of independent phase noise sources is reduced when increasing the number of antenna elements (for both constant and fading channels). Finally, the system model is extended to multiple data channel uses and it is shown that the conclusion is valid for these setups, as well.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07320986.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML Detection in Phase Noise Impaired SIMO Channels With Uplink Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320986/","displayDocTitle":"ML Detection in Phase Noise Impaired SIMO Channels With Uplink Training","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15704883","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320986/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) and ELLIIT"},{"fundingName":"IEEE ICC 2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML Detection in Phase Noise Impaired SIMO Channels With Uplink Training","sourcePdf":"tcomm-pitarokoilis-2498163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184963S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7320986","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7320987,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel S.

This phase retrieval method uses a layered approach, combining repeated minimization of a convex majorizer (surrogate for a nonconvex objective function), and iterative optimization of that majorizer using a preconditioned variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Since phase retrieval is nonconvex, this implementation uses multiple initial majorization vectors. The introduction of a robust 1-norm data fit term that is better adapted to outliers exploits the generality of this framework. The derivation also describes a normalization scheme for the regularization parameter and a known adaptive heuristic for the ADMM penalty parameter. Both 1-D Monte Carlo tests and 2-D image reconstruction simulations suggest the proposed framework, with the robust data fit term, reduces the reconstruction error for data corrupted with both outliers and additive noise, relative to competing algorithms having the same total computation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2015.2498402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/7349277/07320987.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"258","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2015.2498402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undersampled Phase Retrieval With Outliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Undersampled Phase Retrieval With Outliers","volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7320987/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676920","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","pubMedId":"26770999","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)","grantNumber":"F32 EB015914"},{"fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"U01 EB018753"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"170/10"},{"fundingName":"SRC, and Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undersampled Phase Retrieval With Outliers","sourcePdf":"tci-weller-2498402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114316S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"7349277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7349277","articleId":"7320987","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7320988,"authors":[{"name":"Kuntal Mandal","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Nadia, India"],"firstName":"Kuntal","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37409007300"},{"name":"Soumitro Banerjee","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Nadia, India"],"firstName":"Soumitro","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276974100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7320988","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Synchronization","Couplings","Microgrids","Frequency conversion","Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","distributed power generation","interconnections","power supply circuits","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization phenomena","interconnected power electronic systems","converters","DC microgrid","clock frequency","natural coupling","power supply","intermediate bus","nonlinear coupling","frequency synchronization","coupling parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel dc-dc converters","voltage-mode control","dc microgrid","beat frequency","synchronization"]},{"kwd":["Beat frequency","dc microgrid","parallel dc\u2013dc converters","synchronization","voltage-mode control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7320988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7394206/07320988.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2498299","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2498299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization Phenomena in Interconnected Power Electronic Systems","abstract":"It is considered desirable to operate converters connected to a dc microgrid at the same clock frequency, but this may not be feasible in practice as the converters are often procured from different sources.

The energy constrained D2D transmitter harvests energy from multiantenna equipped power beacons (PBs), and communicates with the corresponding receiver using the spectrum of the primary base stations (BSs). We introduce a power transfer model and an information signal model to enable wireless energy harvesting and secure information transmission. In the power transfer model, three wireless power transfer (WPT) policies are proposed: 1) co-operative power beacons (CPB) power transfer, 2) best power beacon (BPB) power transfer, and 3) nearest power beacon (NPB) power transfer. To characterize the power transfer reliability of the proposed three policies, we derive new expressions for the exact power outage probability. Moreover, the analysis of the power outage probability is extended to the case when PBs are equipped with large antenna arrays. In the information signal model, we present a new comparative framework with two receiver selection schemes: 1) best receiver selection (BRS), where the receiver with the strongest channel is selected; and 2) nearest receiver selection (NRS), where the nearest receiver is selected. To assess the secrecy performance, we derive new analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the secrecy throughput considering the two receiver selection schemes using the proposed WPT policies. We presented Monte carlo simulation results to corroborate our analysis and show: 1) secrecy performance improves with increasing densities of PBs and D2D receivers due to larger multiuser diversity gain; 2) CPB achieves better secrecy performance than BPB and NPB but consumes more power; and 3) BRS achieves better secrecy performance than NRS but demands more instantaneous feedback and overhead. A pivotal conclusion is reached that with increasing number of antennas at PBs, NPB offers a comparable secrecy performance to that of BPB but with a lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498171","startPage":"329","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07320989.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure D2D Communication in Large-Scale Cognitive Cellular Networks: A Wireless Power Transfer Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure D2D Communication in Large-Scale Cognitive Cellular Networks: A Wireless Power Transfer Model","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15704907","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7320989/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415/14/22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"172719890"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure D2D Communication in Large-Scale Cognitive Cellular Networks: A Wireless Power Transfer Model","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2498171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090093S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7320989","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7320990,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjie Dong","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yanjie","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085780005"},{"name":"Md.

At worst, the only prior knowledge we know about the encountered noise is that it is different from the involved speech. Therefore, by subtracting the components which cannot be adequately represented by a well defined speech model, the noises can be estimated and removed. Given the good performance of deep learning in signal representation, a deep auto encoder (DAE) is employed in this work for accurately modeling the clean speech spectrum. In the subsequent stage of speech enhancement, an extra DAE is introduced to represent the residual part obtained by subtracting the estimated clean speech spectrum (by using the pre-trained DAE) from the noisy speech spectrum. By adjusting the estimated clean speech spectrum and the unknown parameters of the noise DAE, one can reach a stationary point to minimize the total reconstruction error of the noisy speech spectrum. The enhanced speech signal is thus obtained by transforming the estimated clean speech spectrum back into time domain. The above proposed technique is called separable deep auto encoder (SDAE). Given the under-determined nature of the above optimization problem, the clean speech reconstruction is confined in the convex hull spanned by a pre-trained speech dictionary. New learning algorithms are investigated to respect the non-negativity of the parameters in the SDAE. Experimental results on TIMIT with 20 noise types at various noise levels demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional baselines.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2498101","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7322312/07320993.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and

This approach is inspired by the analogy between packet routing in cognitive radio networks and robot navigation in the presence of obstacles. Using this analogy a general framework for packet routing using potential fields is introduced, in which desired communication destinations can be considered as attractive forces and sources of interference as repulsive forces. Furthermore, three examples of how to construct such potential fields are proposed. Two optimal potential field models with respect to delay and energy and one suboptimal, but computationally simple, potential field based on virtual forces are derived. The potential field approach facilitates using physics-based models of propagation in interference modeling. This paper shows that potential field techniques from robotics can provide an attractive solution to routing in a cognitive radio network and that they can achieve good performance in terms of end-to-end delay and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15835987","publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320998/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robotics Inspired Opportunistic Routing for Cognitive Radio Using Potential Fields","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF/Academy of Finland WIFIUS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1456739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotics Inspired Opportunistic Routing for Cognitive Radio Using Potential Fields","sourcePdf":"tccn-oksanen-2496162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071189S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7095628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7095628","articleId":"7320998","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7320999,"authors":[{"name":"Soonyoung Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7320999/skang-2498161-small.gif","p":["Soonyoung Kang (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

This creates significant difficulties for the deployment of LDPC codes to low-error-rate applications such as storage and wireless systems with no or limited retransmission options. We propose a novel technique for breaking trapping sets based on collaborative decoding that utilizes two different decoding modes. While the main decoding mode executes message passing based on the original parity check matrix of the corresponding LDPC code, the sub-decoding mode operates on a modified parity check matrix formed by removing a portion of check nodes in the factor graph representation of the given code. The modified parity check matrix is designed to promote a passing of correct information into erroneous variable nodes in the trapping set. Theoretical properties of the proposed trapping-set-breaking technique have been established based on the notion of the improved separation for the trapped variable nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed collaborative LDPC decoding scheme switching between the two decoding modes back and forth effectively breaks dominant trapping sets of various known types of regular and irregular LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07320999.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breaking the Trapping Sets in LDPC Codes: Check Node Removal and Collaborative Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Breaking the Trapping Sets in LDPC Codes: Check Node Removal and Collaborative Decoding","volume":"64","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7320999/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15704889","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7320999/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"NRF of Korea","grantNumber":"2010-0029205"},{"fundingName":"SK hynix-KAIST Storage Media Solutions Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breaking the Trapping Sets in LDPC Codes: Check Node Removal and Collaborative Decoding","sourcePdf":"tcomm-moon-2498161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106856S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7320999","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321000,"authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Liu","affiliation":["Smeal Business College, Pennsylvania State University, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/7347533/7321000/liu-small.gif","p":["Siyuan Liu received the first PhD degree from the Department of\n Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the second PhD degree from the\n University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this paper, we study a new problem: distributed data sharing with privacy-preserving requirements. Given a data demander requesting data from multiple distributed data providers, the objective is to enable the data demander to access the distributed data without knowing the privacy of any individual provider. The problem is challenged by two questions: how to transmit the data safely and accurately; and how to efficiently handle data streams? As the first study, we propose a practical method, Shadow Coding, to preserve the privacy in data transmission and ensure the recovery in data collection, which achieves privacy preserving computation in a data-recoverable, efficient, and scalable way. We also provide practical techniques to make Shadow Coding efficient and safe in data streams. Extensive experimental study on a large-scale real-life dataset offers insight into the performance of our schema. The proposed schema is also implemented as a pilot system in a city to collect distributed mobile phone data.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2498156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7347533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2498156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/7347533/07321000.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMC: A Practical Schema for Privacy-Preserved Data Sharing over Distributed Data Streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"SMC: A Practical Schema for Privacy-Preserved Data Sharing over Distributed Data Streams","volume":"1","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321000/","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15663223","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572488"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140610152828686"},{"fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation","grantNumber":"15-11-10032"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC Project","grantNumber":"N HKUST637/13"},{"fundingName":"National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC Guang Dong","grantNumber":"U1301253"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004733","fundingName":"University of Macau","grantNumber":"SRG2015-00050-FST"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340303"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMC: A Practical Schema for Privacy-Preserved Data Sharing over Distributed Data Streams","sourcePdf":"tbdata-liu-2498156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13121S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"7347533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7347533","articleId":"7321000","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321002,"authors":[{"name":"Song Noh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7321002/sonoh-2498184-small.gif","p":["Song Noh (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree from Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea, and the M.S. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, both in electrical engineering, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

Achieving potential gains with large-scale antenna arrays hinges on sufficient channel estimation accuracy. Much prior work focuses on time-division duplex (TDD)-based networks, relying on reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels. However, most currently deployed commercial wireless systems are frequency-division duplex (FDD)-based, making it difficult to exploit channel reciprocity. In massive MIMO FDD systems, the problem of channel estimation becomes even more challenging due to the substantial training resources and feedback requirements which scale with the number of antennas. In this paper, we consider the problem of training sequence design and the mapping of training signals to training periods. We focus on reduced-dimension training sequence designs, along with transmit precoder designs, aimed at reducing both hardware complexity and power consumption. The resulting designs are extended to hybrid analog-digital beamforming systems, which employ a limited number of active RF chains for transmit precoding, by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna systems. A practical guideline for training sequence parameter selection is presented along with performance analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2498184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07321002.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Sequence Design for Feedback Assisted Hybrid Beamforming in Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Training Sequence Design for Feedback Assisted Hybrid Beamforming in Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"64","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321002/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15704893","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321002/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Sequence Design for Feedback Assisted Hybrid Beamforming in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-noh-2498184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190923S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7321002","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321004,"authors":[{"name":"Hen-Geul Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hen-Geul","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37085370387"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7321004","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Fading","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","diversity reception","Doppler shift","error statistics","fading channels","Hadamard codes","Hadamard transforms","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","space-time codes","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable 5G multiuser MIMO system","diversity gain","PAPR","peak-to-average power ratio","WHSTCC scheme","precoder","WH transform","Walsh-Hadamard transform","STCC multiple input multiple output scheme","space-time system","CC scheme","conjugate cancelation scheme","BER","bit error rate","ICI","intercarrier interference","ISI","intersymbol interference","Doppler shift","fifth-generation system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","frequency selective mobile fading channel","MIMO-OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Communication","Signal Processing","MIMO-OFDM","Walsh","Space-Time","Inter-Carrier Interference"]},{"kwd":["Intercarrier interference (ICI)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM)","mobile communication","signal processing","space\u2013time (ST)","Walsh"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used in third and fourth generation and is being planned for fifth-generation (5G) systems. OFDM requires that the received subcarriers be orthogonal. However, various factors, such as residual carrier frequency offset due to Doppler shift in mobile fading channels, can lead to a loss in orthogonality between subcarriers, which results in intersymbol interference (ISI), intercarrier interference (ICI), and bit error rate (BER) degradation. In developing the conjugate cancelation (CC) scheme for mitigating these ISI and ICI of OFDM systems, we integrate the CC scheme together with a space-time (ST) system and form an STCC multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. This STCC system improves the BER without expending power or bandwidth or complexity. Additionally, a Walsh-Hadamard (WH) transform is employed as a precoder for this STCC system and forms a novel WHSTCC scheme. It provides a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at the transmitter and a significant diversity gain at the receiver. Simulations indicate that both STCC and WHSTCC schemes outperform the regular CC and ST systems in mobile fading channels. Both schemes are simple and are backward compatible, and they can serve as the baseband building block for reconfigurable 5G multiuser MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2498300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7337508/07321004.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2498300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectures for MIMO-OFDM Systems in Frequency-Selective Mobile Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321004/","displayDocTitle":"Architectures for MIMO-OFDM Systems in Frequency-Selective Mobile Fading Channels","volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15634280","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321004/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectures for MIMO-OFDM Systems in Frequency-Selective Mobile Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcsii-yeh-2498300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074897S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7337508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7337508","articleId":"7321004","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321013,"authors":[{"name":"Pasquale Foggia","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DIEM), University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7361014/7321013/foggi-2470216-small.gif","p":["\n\nPasquale Foggia received the Laurea (cum laude) degree \nin computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from Federico II University of \nNaples, Naples, Italy, in 1995 and 1999, respectively.

However, in some situations, the visual information is not sufficient or sufficiently reliable, whereas the use of microphones and audio event detectors can significantly improve the overall reliability of surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting road accidents by analyzing audio streams to identify hazardous situations such as tire skidding and car crashes. Our method is based on a two-layer representation of an audio stream: at a low level, the system extracts a set of features that is able to capture the discriminant properties of the events of interest, and at a high level, a representation based on a bag-of-words approach is then exploited in order to detect both short and sustained events. The deployment architecture for using the system in real environments is discussed, together with an experimental analysis carried out on a data set made publicly available for benchmarking purposes. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2470216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7361014/07321013.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2470216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7361014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio Surveillance of Roads: A System for Detecting Anomalous Sounds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321013/","displayDocTitle":"Audio Surveillance of Roads: A System for Detecting Anomalous Sounds","volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669293","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321013/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A.I.Tech s.r.l."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio Surveillance of Roads: A System for Detecting Anomalous Sounds","sourcePdf":"tits-vento-2470216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110427S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7361014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7361014","articleId":"7321013","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321025,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dielectrics Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7321025/jiliu-2498129-small.gif","p":["Ji Liu received the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in high voltage and insulation technology from Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2000 and 2014, respectively.","Since 2010, he has been a major Researcher with the State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dielectrics Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology.

This paper proposes a new inversing approach to such a problem. It combines cuckoo search (CS) and particle filter (PF) to estimate the defect profile from measured signals and adopts a radial-basis function neural network as a forward model as well as the observation equation in PF. As one of the latest nature-inspired heuristic optimization algorithms, CS can solve high-dimensional optimization problems. As an effective estimator for a nonlinear filtering problem, PF is applied to the proposed inversing approach in order to improve the latter's robustness to the noise. The resulting algorithm enjoys the advantages of both CS and PF where CS produces the optimized state sequence for PF while PF processes the state sequence and estimates the desired profile. The simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach is significantly better than the inversing approach based on CS alone in a noisy environment.","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7434678/07321028.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7434678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2498119","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2498119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Mathematical model","Birds","Finite element analysis","Magnetic flux leakage","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic flux","neural nets","nonlinear filters","optimisation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cuckoo search","particle filter-based inversing approach","defect profile estimation","magnetic flux leakage signals","inverse problem","measured signals","radial basis function neural network","forward model","observation equation","nature-inspired heuristic optimization","high-dimensional optimization problems","nonlinear filtering problem","state sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cuckoo search","inversing problem","magnetic flux leakage","particle filter"]},{"kwd":["Cuckoo search (CS)","inversing problem","magnetic flux leakage (MFL)","optimization","particle filter (PF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cuckoo Search and Particle Filter-Based Inversing Approach to Estimating Defects via Magnetic Flux Leakage Signals","externalId":"6200511","accessionNumber":"15855269","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321028/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cuckoo Search and Particle Filter-Based Inversing Approach to Estimating Defects via Magnetic Flux Leakage Signals","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhou-2498119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104935S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7434678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7434678","articleId":"7321028","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321029,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7331739/7321029/li-2498406-small.gif","p":["Yun Li received the M.S. degree in computer engineering and the Technical Licentiate degree in computer and system science from Mid Sweden University (MIUN), Sweden, in 2008 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Information and Communication Systems.

By placing a microlens array in front of the photosensor, the focused plenoptic cameras capture both spatial and angular information of a scene in each microlens image and across microlens images. The capturing results in a significant amount of redundant information, and the captured image is usually of a large resolution. A coding scheme that removes the redundancy before coding can be of advantage for efficient compression, transmission, and rendering. In this paper, we propose a lossy coding scheme to efficiently represent plenoptic images. The format contains a sparse image set and its associated disparities. The reconstruction is performed by disparity-based interpolation and inpainting, and the reconstructed image is later employed as a prediction reference for the coding of the full plenoptic image. As an outcome of the representation, the proposed scheme inherits a scalable structure with three layers. The results show that plenoptic images are compressed efficiently with over 60 percent bit rate reduction compared with High Efficiency Video Coding intra coding, and with over 20 percent compared with an High Efficiency Video Coding block copying mode.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2498406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7331739/07321029.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2498406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Coding of Plenoptic Images by Using a Sparse Set and Disparities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321029/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Coding of Plenoptic Images by Using a Sparse Set and Disparities","volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15602541","pubMedId":"26561433","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321029/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Knowledge Foundation, Sweden","grantNumber":"20120328"},{"fundingName":"European Union European Regional Development Fund, Sweden","grantNumber":"00174636"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Coding of Plenoptic Images by Using a Sparse Set and Disparities","sourcePdf":"tip-li-2498406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092098S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7331739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7331739","articleId":"7321029","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321030,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Chi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7321030/hchen-2498135-small.gif","p":["Hung-Chi Chen (M\u201906) was born in Taichung, Taiwan, in 1974.

In this paper, the decoupled current-balancing control (DCBC) with two parallel loops is proposed. At first, the small-signal transfer functions of the voltage-regulation loop and the current balancing loop to the controller output are derived. The results show that the voltage-regulation loop and the proposed current-balancing loop are nominally decoupled. That is, two PI-type controllers can be designed independently and included to implement the proposed DCBC. Additionally, the single-sensor sampling-current strategy is proposed to obtain two average inductor currents by sensing only the sum of diode currents. All the controllers are implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

A multichannel airborne ultrasonic data communication system is described in this paper. ON-OFF keying (OOK) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation schemes were implemented successfully in the system by using a pair of commercially available capacitive ultrasonic transducers in a relatively low multipath indoor laboratory environment. Six channels were used from 50 to 110 kHz with a channel spacing of 12 kHz, allowing multiple 8-bit data packets to be transmitted simultaneously. The system data transfer rate achieved was up to 60 kb/s and ultrasonic wireless synchronization was implemented instead of using a hard-wired link. A model developed in the work could accurately predict ultrasonic signals through the air channels. Signal root mean square (rms) values and system bit error rates (BERs) were analyzed over different distances. Error-free decoding was achieved over ranges up to 5 m using a multichannel OOK modulation scheme. To obtain the highest data transfer rate and the longest error-free transmission distance, a range-dependent multichannel scheme with variable data rates, channel frequencies, and different modulation schemes, was also studied in the work. Within 2 m, error-free transmission was achieved using a five-channel OOK with a data rate of 63 kb/s. Between 2 and 5 m, six-channel OOK with 60 kb/s data transfer rate was error free. Beyond 5 m, the error-free transmission range could be extended up to 10 m using three-channel BPSK with a reduced data rate of 30 kb/s. The situation when two transducers were misaligned using three-channel OOK and BPSK schemes was also investigated in the work. It was concluded that error-free transmission could still be achieved with a lateral displacement of less than 7% and oblique angles of less than 7\u00b0, and three-channel BPSK proved to be more robust than three-channel OOK with transducer misalignment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Binary phase shift keying","Transducers","Atmospheric modeling","Frequency modulation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic communication (telecommunication)","aircraft communication","amplitude shift keying","channel spacing","data communication","decoding","error statistics","mean square error methods","multipath channels","on-board communications","phase shift keying","synchronisation","ultrasonic transducers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication","multichannel airborne ultrasonic data communication system","range-dependent modulation scheme","on-off keying","binary phase-shift keying modulation scheme","BPSK modulation scheme","ultrasonic transducer","multipath indoor laboratory environment","channel spacing","ultrasonic wireless synchronization","hard-wired link","air channel","Signal root mean square values","RMS value","bit error rate","BER","error-free decoding","multichannel OOK modulation scheme","frequency 50 kHz to 110 kHz","word length 8 bit","bit rate 63 kbit/s","bit rate 60 kbit/s","bit rate 30 kbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-channel Communication","Capacitive Ultrasonic Transducer","Air-coupled Ultrasound","OOK and BPSK Modulation","Wireless Synchronization","Bit Error Rate"]},{"kwd":["Air-coupled ultrasound","bit error rate (BER)","capacitive ultrasonic transducer","multichannel communication","on\u2013off keying (OOK)\u00a0and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)\u00a0modulation","wireless synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2498479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7368974/07321037.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2498479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Ultrasonic Data Communications in Air Using Range-Dependent Modulation Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Ultrasonic Data Communications in Air Using Range-Dependent Modulation Schemes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321037/","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321037/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15685133","pubMedId":"26561368","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)\u00a0Research Frontiers Programme","grantNumber":"11/RFP.1/ECE/3119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Ultrasonic Data Communications in Air Using Range-Dependent Modulation Schemes","sourcePdf":"tuffc-jiang-2498479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082269S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7368974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7368974","articleId":"7321037","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321040,"authors":[{"name":"Shibo He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7321040/he-2498281-small.gif","p":["Shibo He (M'13) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2012.","He is currently a Professor with Zhejiang University.

Full-view area coverage is challenging because the full-view coverage of a 2-D continuous domain has to be considered. To tackle this challenge, we first study the intrinsic geometric relationship between the full-view area coverage and the full-view point coverage and prove that the full-view area coverage can be guaranteed, as long as a selected full-view ensuring set of points is full-view covered. This leads to a significant dimension reduction for the full-view area coverage problem. Next, we prove that the minimum-number full-view point coverage is NP-hard and propose two approximation algorithms to solve it from two different perspectives, respectively: 1) By introducing a full-view coverage ratio function, we quantify the \u201ccontribution\u201d of each camera sensor to the full-view coverage through which we transform the full-view point coverage into a submodular set cover problem and propose a greedy algorithm (GA); and 2) by studying the geometric relationship between the full-view coverage and the traditional coverage, we propose a set-cover-based algorithm (SCA). We analyze the performance of these two approximation algorithms and characterize their approximation ratios. Furthermore, we devise two distributed algorithms that obtain the same approximation ratios as GA and SCA, respectively. Finally, we provide extensive simulation results to validate our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2498281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07321040.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2498281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"7448","endPage":"7461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-View Area Coverage in Camera Sensor Networks: Dimension Reduction and Near-Optimal Solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321040","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7569115/7321040-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Full-View Area Coverage in Camera Sensor Networks: Dimension Reduction and Near-Optimal Solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321040/","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7321040/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61402405 and 61528105"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015FZA5011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1457278, CNS-1422277 and ECCS-1408409"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Full-View Area Coverage in Camera Sensor Networks: Dimension Reduction and Near-Optimal Solutions","sourcePdf":"tvt-he-2498281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190723S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7321040","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321043,"authors":[{"name":"Kisong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Kunsan National University, Gunsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7321043/kilee-2498181-small.gif","p":["Kisong Lee (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, South Korea, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2007, 2009, and 2013, respectively.

In particular, to enable self-healing operations in indoor wireless communications systems, an autonomous mechanism to resolve unforeseen network failure problems should be considered. Therefore, we here address the issue of autonomous self-healing, in which continuous connectivity can be provided to users by resolving unexpected network failures. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-complexity resource allocation algorithm based on an optimization approach with reduced message passing. In the proposed algorithm, normal base stations perform subchannel and power allocations with a minimum amount of information sharing (N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</sub>\n(M-1) to provide reliable service to users in faulty cells autonomously. We also show that the proposed algorithm converges to a unique fixed point in the low-interference region by using a contraction mapping technique.

Moreover, the excessive synchronization traffic in mobile networks is more important in terms of radio resource utilization and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an efficient delta synchronization (EDS) algorithm that aggregates the updated data to reduce the synchronization traffic and synchronizes the aggregated one periodically to satisfy the consistency. To find out the optimal policy for the aggregation and the periodical synchronization, an optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a value iteration algorithm is presented for computing the stationary deterministic policy. Numerical results demonstrate that EDS can choose the optimal action that strikes a balance between the reduction of the synchronization traffic and the satisfaction of the consistency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2498168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944974","startPage":"341","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7944974/07321044.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Delta Synchronization Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Storage Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7321044/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Delta Synchronization Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Storage Applications","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16948567","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"NRF of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A12066986"},{"fundingName":"R&D program of MOTIE/KEIT","grantNumber":"10051306"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Delta Synchronization Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Storage Applications","sourcePdf":"tsc-pack-2498168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148578S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7944974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7944974","articleId":"7321044","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321045,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["B-DAT Lab, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Statistics & Biostatistics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7321045/7321045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Wang (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree in Material Engineering and the M.S. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Korea University, Korea, in 2006, 2009, and 2013, respectively.

For these kind of applications, it is very important that welds are of good quality due to the sterility and biological hazard concerns. This usually means that welds must have a certain predetermined strength. In production environment, destructive testing of sample products is a commonly used method of quality control. This is, however, time consuming and the results obtained on sample testing can by no means be fully relied upon for all the products within a batch. Therefore, a decision was made to design an artificial intelligence monitoring system that could determine the quality of each weld based on the measurements performed in real time. The main signal being measured is the displacement of the upper electrode. Various parameters of the displacement curve were found out to be in relation with the weld strength. Due to disturbances in air supply that result in variable welding force, a force sensor was added as well. The measurements obtained from both the sensors were used to form the input vector for linear vector quantization neural network. This type of network is suitable to put the input vectors in different classes. In our case, this means if a certain measurement corresponds to a good quality weld or a bad quality weld. The experiments have shown that the proposed neural network performs really well and could be of great value in a production environment.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2015.2498278","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1071","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2015.2498278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422867","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7422867/07321054.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of LVQ Neural Network for Weld Strength Evaluation of RF-Welded Plastic Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321054/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Application of LVQ Neural Network for Weld Strength Evaluation of RF-Welded Plastic Materials","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7321054/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15822987","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of LVQ Neural Network for Weld Strength Evaluation of RF-Welded Plastic Materials","sourcePdf":"tmech-podrzaj-2498278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069776S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7422867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7422867","articleId":"7321054","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321055,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Han","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7321055/7321055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chong Han (S\u201912) received the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications from The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2011, and received the Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA, in 2012.

In this paper, a multi-wideband waveform design for the THz band is proposed, by exploiting the channel peculiarities including the distance-varying spectral windows, the delay spread and the temporal broadening effects. This scheme allows the dynamical variation of the rate and the transmit power on each sub-window and improves the distance. Moreover, the closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-the-noise and bit-error-rate for the multi-wideband waveform are derived, by considering the inter-symbol and inter-band interferences. Then, an optimization framework is formulated to solve for the multi-wideband waveform design parameters of the transmit power and the number of frames, with the aim to maximize the communication distance while satisfying the rate and the transmit power constraints. Four sub-optimal solutions are proposed and compared. The results show that the SINR increases with the transmit power and the number of frames, at the cost of the power consumption and the rate decrease. With the transmit power of 10 dBm, the largest distance to support 10 Gbps for the multi-path propagation is 4 m, which is realized via the power allocation scheme to minimize the power/bit on each sub-window and is 10% improvement over the fixed scheme. However, for the directional transmission, this scheme under-exploits the transmit power severely. Instead, the allocation scheme that minimizes the number of frames outperforms the other three schemes. In terms of the maximum distance that achieves 30 Gbps, this scheme reaches 22.5 m.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2498133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07321055.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2498133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Wideband Waveform Design for Distance-Adaptive Wireless Communications in the Terahertz Band","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Wideband Waveform Design for Distance-Adaptive Wireless Communications in the Terahertz Band","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321055/","accessionNumber":"15719677","volume":"64","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1349828"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Wideband Waveform Design for Distance-Adaptive Wireless Communications in the Terahertz Band","sourcePdf":"tsp-han-2498133-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067675S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7321055","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7321057,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Khoshkbar Sadigh","affiliation":["Extron Electronics, Anaheim, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7321057/sadig-small.gif","p":["Arash Khoshkbar Sadigh (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the\n B.S. and M.S. degrees (both with first Hons.) in electrical engineering from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran,\n in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of\n California-Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2014.","He was with AranNagshAra Consultant Engineering Company, Tabriz, from 2007 to 2010, where he was involved in the\n design of power transmission and distribution lines.

Active neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) flying capacitor multicell (FCM) converter is a well-known type of multilevel converters which is commercially available in high-power medium-voltage motor drive market. Since power loss investigation can be very advantageous in the design phase of multilevel converters, this paper presents an analytical approach to calculate and investigate the conduction and switching power loss in ANPC-FCM converter. First, the RMS and average currents of insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and antiparallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the associated duty cycle of each IGBT and diode, converter modulation index, load current, and load power factor. Numerical results of the derived closed-form equations to calculate the RMS and average currents of IGBTs/diodes are compared with simulation results and experimental measurements. Numerical results match the simulation results and experimental measurements which validates the derived closed-form equations. Afterward, the obtained equations for RMS and average current computations are utilized to calculate the conduction power losses in a 12.1-MVA 6.6-kV nine-level (line-to-line) ANPC-FCM multilevel converter. For this purpose, a 4.5-kV 1.2-kA IGBT module from ABB is considered as a power switch and its parameters are employed in analytical computations and simulation of the ANPC-FCM multilevel converter for conduction power loss determination. Moreover, closed-form equations are derived for analytical determination of switching power losses for ANPC-FCM converter using Kapteyn (Fourier-Bessel) series. Based on the derived closed-form equations for conduction loss and switching loss calculation, a method is presented to determine the junction temperature in IGBTs and diodes for ANPC-FCM converter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Switches","Mathematical model","Semiconductor diodes","Linear approximation","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","insulated gate bipolar transistors","power convertors","power factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flying-capacitor-based active neutral-point-clamped multilevel converter","medium-voltage high-power","flying capacitor multicell converter","insulated-gate bipolar transistors","IGBT","antiparallel diodes","converter modulation index","load current","load power factor","conduction power loss determination","Kapteyn","Fourier-Bessel series","conduction loss","switching loss","ANPC-FCM converter","apparent power 12.1 MVA","voltage 6.6 kV","voltage 4.5 kV","current 1.2 kA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel Converter","Flying Capacitor Multicell Converter","Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","Conduction Power Loss","Switching Power Loss","Closed-Form Solutions"]},{"kwd":["Active neutral point clamped converter","closed-form equations","conduction power loss","flying capacitor multicell converter","multilevel converter","switching power loss"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7423826/07321057.pdf","startPage":"5473","endPage":"5494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Determination of Conduction and Switching Power Losses in Flying-Capacitor-Based Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Multilevel Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Determination of Conduction and Switching Power Losses in Flying-Capacitor-Based Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Multilevel Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321057/","volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321057/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15823165","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Determination of Conduction and Switching Power Losses in Flying-Capacitor-Based Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-corzine-2498107-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131162S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7321057","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":7321058,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Intelligent Sensing, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7321058/7321058-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Wang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2003; and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2010.

A major challenge is that the TDOAs contain unknown time offsets between asynchronous sensors. To address this problem, we propose a low-rank approximation method that does not need any prior knowledge of sensor and source locations or timing information. At first, we construct a pseudo time of arrival (TOA) matrix by introducing two sets of unknown timing parameters (source onset times and device capture times) into the current TDOA matrix. Then we propose a Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm to jointly identify the two sets of unknown timing parameters, exploiting the low-rank property embedded in the pseudo TOA matrix. We derive the boundaries of the timing parameters to reduce the initialization space and employ a multi-initialization scheme. Finally, we use the estimated timing parameters to correct the pseudo TOA matrix, which is further applied to sensor and source localization. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07321058.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2498130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2498130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Localization of Ad-Hoc Arrays Using Time Difference of Arrivals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Microphones","Position measurement","Array signal processing","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","approximation theory","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","matrix algebra","Newton method","sensor placement","time-of-arrival estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad-hoc array self-localization","time difference of arrival estimation","source joint localization","TDOAs","asynchronous sensors","pseudo time of arrival matrix","Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm","multiinitialization scheme","ad-hoc sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad-hoc array","low rank approximation","self-localization","time-difference of arrival"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Self-Localization of Ad-Hoc Arrays Using Time Difference of Arrivals","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7321058/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15719680","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Self-Localization of Ad-Hoc Arrays Using Time Difference of Arrivals","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2498130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111285S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7321058","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321059,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Jin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7321059/7321059-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Jin Jeong received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2008, and the M.

The convergence analysis of the adaptive filter algorithm is an important concept because it provides a guideline to design the adaptive filter. However, the convergence analysis of the MSAF algorithm has not been researched as extensively as that of the normalized least-mean-square algorithm. Therefore, it needs to be researched. In this paper, we present a new approach to the mean-square deviation (MSD) analysis of the MSAF algorithm by using the persistently exciting input and the practical assumption that the stopband attenuation of the prototype filter is high. Unlike the previous analysis, the proposed analysis is possible to be applied to the long-length adaptive filter such as the acoustic echo cancellation. The proposed analysis is also applied to a non-stationary model with a random walk of the optimal weight vector. The simulation results match with the theoretical results in both the transient-state and steady-state MSD.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2498136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2498136","startPage":"985","endPage":"994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07321059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean-Square Deviation Analysis of Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Mean-Square Deviation Analysis of Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321059/","accessionNumber":"15719683","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321059/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1D1A1A09059377"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean-Square Deviation Analysis of Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-kim-2498136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090007S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7321059","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321061,"authors":[{"name":"Changliang Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Electrical Engineering and Energy, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7321061/xia-small.gif","p":["Changliang Xia (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201912) was born in Tianjin,\n China, in 1968.

The proposed strategy takes a number of virtual vectors, of which magnitude and angle can be configured freely, as candidate vectors. By taking advantage of the variety of the virtual vector, the proposed strategy can obtain superior steady-state and dynamic performance. To choose the optimal vector from all of virtual vectors, first quantify the change rule of the torque and stator flux generated by each different virtual vector, and then take the magnitude and angle of the virtual vector, stator flux angle, and the quantificational factor as four dimensions to establish 4D-ST; by analyzing the distributed laws of quantificational factors in 4D-ST, we can compress 4D-ST and propose a quarter selector to choose the optimal vector accurately and rapidly. By taking the step function instead of the hysteresis comparator as the torque and flux controller, the direct torque control using 4D-ST can be realized. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments with prototype are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7423826/07321061.pdf","startPage":"5774","endPage":"5785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498207","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321061","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Switches","Stators","Standards","Modulation","Torque control","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","machine vector control","magnetic flux","numerical analysis","optimal control","permanent magnet motors","stators","switching convertors","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-dimensional switching-table","VSI-PMSM direct torque control","4D-ST","voltage source inverter-permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system","steady-state performance","dynamic performance","torque generation","stator flux generation","optimal vector","virtual vector","step function","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct torque control","Permanent magnet synchronous motor","Switching-table","Virtual vector"]},{"kwd":["Direct torque control (DTC)","permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","switching-table (ST)","virtual vector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Direct Torque Control for VSI\u2013PMSMs Using Four-Dimensional Switching-Table","accessionNumber":"15823196","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321061/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB035600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407127"},{"fundingName":"Application Foundation and Front Technology Research Program of Tianjin","grantNumber":"13JCZDJC34700"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Torque Control for VSI\u2013PMSMs Using Four-Dimensional Switching-Table","sourcePdf":"tpel-xia-2498207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098768S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7321061","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321064,"authors":[{"name":"Oriel Shoshani","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7407434/7321064/7321064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oriel Shoshani received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree (direct program) in mechanical engineering from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2014.

The model is analyzed using the method of stochastic averaging and the results suggest an optimal operating point for minimizing phase noise in either of the oscillators by varying the operating amplitudes and the nature and strength of the coupling. We also show that the system with asymmetric coupling has the ability to reduce the phase noise of the noisier oscillator beyond the expected result for synchronized oscillators. The analytical predictions, which are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, show how one can exploit nonlinear behavior to improve phase noise characteristics using a pair of coupled oscillators.

As a result, the applicability of the proposed FDTD scheme is limited.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \u201cFractional Derivative Based FDTD Modeling of Transient Wave Propagation in Havriliak\u2013Negami Media\u201d","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2495200","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7343772/07321065.pdf","startPage":"4188","endPage":"4190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2495200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Comments on \u201cFractional Derivative Based FDTD Modeling of Transient Wave Propagation in Havriliak\u2013Negami Media\u201d","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7321065/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15635446","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on \u201cFractional Derivative Based FDTD Modeling of Transient Wave Propagation in Havriliak\u2013Negami Media\u201d","sourcePdf":"tmtt-rekanos-2495200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054431S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7343772","articleId":"7321065","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321068,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Sans","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7343772/7321068/7321068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nMarc Sans (S\u201915) was born in Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain, in 1982.

The proposed filters are based on multisection mirrored stepped impedance resonators (SIRs) coupled through quarter-wavelength transmission lines, acting as admittance inverters. Such resonant elements provide transmission zeros useful for the suppression of the common mode in the region of interest (differential filter pass band) and for the improvement of the differential-mode stopband (rejection level and selectivity). Due to the limited functionality of the inverters, related to the wide fractional bandwidths, the automated filter design requires a two-step process. With the first ASM, the filter schematic satisfying the required specifications (optimum filter schematic) is determined. Then, the layout is synthesized by means of a second ASM algorithm. Both algorithms are explained in detail and are applied to the synthesis of two filters, as illustrative (and representative) examples. With this paper, it is demonstrated that the two-step ASM optimization scheme (first providing the optimum schematic and then the layout), previously applied by the authors to wideband single-ended filters, can be extended (conveniently modified) to common-mode suppressed differential-mode bandpass filters. Thus, the value of this two-step ASM approach is enhanced by demonstrating its potential for the unattended design of complex filters, as those considered in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15635443","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7321068/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated Design of Common-Mode Suppressed Balanced Wideband Bandpass Filters by Means of Aggressive Space Mapping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Design of Common-Mode Suppressed Balanced Wideband Bandpass Filters by Means of Aggressive Space Mapping","sourcePdf":"tmtt-selga-2495180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133393S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7343772","articleId":"7321068","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7321071,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An important goal in this development is the optimization of efficiency at any given operating point. In order to achieve this, each RF module has been equipped with its own direct-current (DC) Power Supply Controller (PS Controller), providing sufficient intelligence (control logic, monitoring of sensors, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, interlock check, etc.) to adjust the drain and bias voltages in a fully independent and automatic way. With this technique it is possible to maximize the overall efficiency at any given RF output power. Considerable effort has been made in order to obtain extensive measurements from each individual module with the aim of investigating the behaviour of such a large number of combined arrays. We will discuss the amplifier design and present the results of measurements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Power generation","Cooling","Power supplies","Power amplifiers","Monitoring","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radioactive sources","solid-state nuclear track detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state power amplifier","accelerator applications","Paul Scherrer Institut","klystron amplifier","Swiss Light Source","optional radio frequency source","booster cavity","direct-current power supply controller","analog-to-digital conversion","digital-to-analog conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerator technology","efficiency","high frequency","high power","MOSFET","RF amplifier","solid state","synchrotron light sources"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2477603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7454792/07321071.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7454792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2477603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact 500\u00a0MHz 65\u00a0kW Solid-State Power Amplifier for Accelerator Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Compact 500\u00a0MHz 65\u00a0kW Solid-State Power Amplifier for Accelerator Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321071/","volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321071/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15934698","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact 500\u00a0MHz 65\u00a0kW Solid-State Power Amplifier for Accelerator Applications","sourcePdf":"tns-gaspar-2477603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046262S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7454792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7454792","articleId":"7321071","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321073,"authors":[{"name":"Shida Liu","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shida","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085832206"},{"name":"Zhongsheng Hou","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongsheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945500"},{"name":"Chenkun Yin","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenkun","lastName":"Yin","id":"37398564400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7321073","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":596},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Temperature measurement","Coal","Biological cells","Production","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","coal gasification","fuel processing industries","neural nets","syngas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven modeling","UGI gasification process","enhanced genetic BP neural network","link switch","enhanced genetic backpropagation neural network","EGA-BPNN-LS","united gas improvement gasifier","UGI gasifier","crude gas","syngas industry","temperature dynamics","first principles","gas temperature","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","optimized network structure","network gradient information","coal gasification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven modeling","genetic algorithm (GA)","link switches","neural networks","UGI gasifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321073","abstract":"In this brief, an enhanced genetic back-propagation neural network with link switches (EGA-BPNN-LS) is proposed to address a data-driven modeling problem for gasification processes inside United Gas Improvement (UGI) gasifiers. The online-measured temperature of crude gas produced during the gasification processes plays a dominant role in the syngas industry; however, it is difficult to model temperature dynamics via first principles due to the practical complexity of the gasification process, especially as reflected by severe changes in the gas temperature resulting from infrequent manipulations of the gasifier in practice. The proposed data-driven modeling approach, EGA-BPNN-LS, incorporates an NN-LS, an EGA, and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The approach cannot only learn the relationships between the control input and the system output from historical data using an optimized network structure through a combination of EGA and NN-LS but also makes use of the networks gradient information via the LM algorithm. EGA-BPNN-LS is applied to a set of data collected from the field to model the UGI gasification processes, and the effectiveness of EGA-BPNN-LS is verified.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2491325","startPage":"2718","endPage":"2729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2491325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7745987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7745987/07321073.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling for UGI Gasification Processes via an Enhanced Genetic BP Neural Network With Link Switches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321073/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling for UGI Gasification Processes via an Enhanced Genetic BP Neural Network With Link Switches","volume":"27","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7321073/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16465549","pubMedId":"26561485","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014YJS024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61120106009, 61403025 and 61433002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Modeling for UGI Gasification Processes via an Enhanced Genetic BP Neural Network With Link Switches","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2491325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19223S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7745987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7745987","articleId":"7321073","onlineDate":"05 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321122,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Gaska","affiliation":["Lockheed Martin MST-Owego, Endicott, Owego, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gaska","id":"38540898900"},{"name":"Chris Watkin","affiliation":["Binghamton University, Binghamton, GA, USA","Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, Savannah, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Watkin","id":"37085718546"},{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["Binghamton University, Binghamton, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407070200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"7321122","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2530},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321122","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aerospace electronics","Aerospace engineering","Software development","Computer architecture","Military aircraft","Modular construction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","avionics","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated modular avionics","software levels","line replaceable units","LRUs","centralized processing units","weight reduction","maintenance savings","commercial airborne platforms","military airborne platforms","F-22 joint integrated avionics working group","JIAWG","business jets","space partitioned software environments","time partitioned software environments","ARINC 653 standard","software complexity","ARINC 653 extended IMA definition","complex systems management","common software infrastructure development","civil aviation","Airbus 380","Boeing 787 Dream-liner platforms"]}],"abstract":"IMA (Integrated Modular Avionics) approaches have been around for 30 years but vary widely in implementation and the extent of both hardware and software levels of unification. The IMA concept, which replaces numerous separate processors and line replaceable units (LRUs) with fewer, more centralized processing units, has led to significant weight reduction and maintenance savings in both military and commercial airborne platforms. The IMA concept for this definition originated in the United States with the F-22 Joint Integrated Avionics Working Group (JIAWG) 30 years ago and then migrated to business jets and commercial transports in the late 1990s. In the last 10 years, the mainstream IMA definition has incorporated time and space partitioned software environments based on the ARINC 653 standard. During this period, software complexity has exploded. The ARINC 653 extended IMA definition has enabled the development of common software infrastructure to enhance complex systems management and enable greater software reuse. In open literature, civil aviation has cornerstone IMA extended examples in the Airbus 380 and Boeing 787 Dream-liner platforms. This article provides a summary of IMA history, presents these new IMA challenges going forward, and summarizes research focus exploring advanced IMA solutions.","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2015.150014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2015.150014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/62/7321113/07321122.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Modular Avionics - Past, present, and future","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Modular Avionics - Past, present, and future","volume":"30","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321122/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583832","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321122/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Modular Avionics - Past, present, and future","sourcePdf":"i0885898530912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05111S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"7321113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7321113","articleId":"7321122","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321126,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Insaurralde","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Teesside University, Heriot-Watt University, Middlesbrough, Edinburgh, Tees Valley, United Kingdom, Scotland"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Insaurralde","id":"38301547300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"7321126","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aerospace electronics","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Aerodynamics","Power demand","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","avionics","reconfigurable architectures","software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable computer architecture","RCA","high-integrity avionics system","aerospace","system development life cycle","certification process","computing granularity","agile management"]}],"abstract":"Computing and processing capabilities from reconfgurable computer architectures (RCAs) can provide high-integrity avionics systems with outstanding effciency and effectiveness, as they do in other domains. However, they are still underexploited in many applications. The main driver of this situation is that devices implementing such architectures are too advanced and powerful for the system's needs. The situation in avionics is even worst, because there are just few certifable RCA devices for aerospace. In addition, the fexible nature of RCAs incurs high costs and risks along the system development life cycle (certifcation processes).

While Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) is helping developers overcome many of these challenges in many domains, it is not generally applied in the computer game domain. DSM can be hard to apply in the computer game domain because of the complexity of computer game domain knowledge and the peculiarity of traditional computer game development process. Without fully understanding these issues and properly solving them, the strength of DSM approaches will be constrained and game developers will be reluctant to use DSM. In this article, we investigate the development process and explore the feasibility of fitting DSM tasks in traditional computer game development in a compact way to lower cost and improve software quality. We introduce the workflow and illustrate the usage of it by presenting a case study. Further, we discuss the benefits and costs of involving DSM solutions in computer game development.

Diverse population sources can be used to support sampling for such studies. Goal: To compare two samples, one from the crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk and another from the professional social network LinkedIn, in an online experiment for evaluating the relevance of Java code snippets to programming tasks. Method: To compare the samples (subjects' experience, programming habits) and experimental results concerned with three experimental trials. Results: LinkedIn's subjects present significantly higher levels of experience in Java programming and programming in general than Mechanical Turk's subjects. The experimental results revealed a significant difference between samples and suggested that LinkedIn's subjects were more pessimistic than Mechanical Turk's subjects despite a high level consistency in the experimental results. Conclusion: The combined use of sources of sampling can bring benefits to large scale studies in software engineering, especially when heterogeneity is desired in the population. Thus, it can be useful to investigate and characterize alternative sources of sampling for performing large-scale studies in software engineering.","doi":"10.1109/ESEM.2015.7321205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2015.7321205","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7320463/7321177/07321205.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating Samples Representativeness for an Online Experiment in Java Code Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigating Samples Representativeness for an Online Experiment in Java Code Search","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321205/","accessionNumber":"15586760","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321205/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating Samples Representativeness for an Online Experiment in Java Code Search","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"pid1168428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069843S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7320463","isNumber":"7321177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7320463","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7321177","articleId":"7321205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321210,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Vetro","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Vetro","id":"37400834900"},{"name":"Wolfgang Bohm","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Bohm","id":"37085422418"},{"name":"Marco Torchiano","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Torchiano","id":"37266012900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7899-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3770"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3789"}],"articleNumber":"7321210","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Unified modeling language","Modeling","Industries","Software engineering","Electronic mail","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software modelling","model driven techniques","differentiated replication","embedded systems","Italian industry"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321210","doi":"10.1109/ESEM.2015.7321210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2015.7321210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321177","publicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7320463/7321177/07321210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Benefits and Barriers When Adopting Software Modelling and Model Driven Techniques - An External, Differentiated Replication","abstract":"Context: Applying model driven techniques can lead to several benefits, but their adoption entails also numerous issues.

In this field, the geometric multigrid method (GMG) is one of the most efficient algorithms for solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Herein we analyze the performance of an optimized GPU based implementation of the GMG method on different state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs. The GTX Titan Black card, set-up with increased double precision performance leads to the smallest execution time. It is marginally faster than the more recently released GTX Titan X card which has considerably lower double precision performance. Moreover, an energy efficiency analysis reveals that the GTX 660M and the more powerful Titan cards require a similar amount of energy for running the GMG algorithm: the larger execution time is compensated by the lower power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321289","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312650/7321255/07321289.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321289","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Performance comparison on recent NVIDIA architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Performance comparison on recent NVIDIA architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321289/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321289/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586559","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Performance comparison on recent NVIDIA architectures","confLoc":"Cheile Gradistei, Romania","sourcePdf":"34art30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091818S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312650","isNumber":"7321255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312650","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7321255","articleId":"7321289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321299,"authors":[{"name":"Dorin \u015eendrescu","affiliation":["Department of Automatics and Electronics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"\u015eendrescu","id":"37542131500"},{"name":"Emil Petre","affiliation":["Department of Automatics and Electronics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Petre","id":"37542139000"},{"name":"Eugen Boba\u015fu","affiliation":["Department of Automatics and Electronics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Eugen","lastName":"Boba\u015fu","id":"37829423500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8481-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8480-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7321299","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321299","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Biological system modeling","Optimization","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Kinetic theory","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biotechnology","catalysis","control system analysis","control system synthesis","enzymes","microorganisms","numerical analysis","optimal control","particle swarm optimisation","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal PID controller design","particle swarm optimization","bacterial growth bioprocess","heuristic approach","enzymatic catalysis","controller parameters","objective function minimization","controller tuning problem","multimodal numerical optimization problem","nonlinear kinetic expressions","Monod equations","Haldane equations","microbial growth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PID control","Nonlinear systems","Bioprocesses","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321299","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312650/7321255/07321299.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","startPage":"237","endPage":"242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal PID controller design based on Particle Swarm Optimization for bacterial growth bioprocess","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization represents a heuristic approach that can be used to solve difficult optimization problems.

To enhance the selection of channel with less noise among the white spaces (idle channels), the a priory knowledge of Radio Frequency (RF) power is very important. Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques cans be applied to these scenarios to predict the required RF power in the available channels to achieve optimum Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) FM and TV bands. Sensitivity analysis was used to reduce the input vector of the prediction models. The inputs of the ANN and SVR consist of only time domain data and past RF power without using any RF power related parameters, thus forming a nonlinear time series prediction model. The application of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. Since CR are embedded communication devices with memory constrain limitation, the models used, implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN's through the use of compact differential evolutionary (cDE) algorithm variants which are memory efficient. This was found to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the ANN model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15586477","htmlLink":"/document/7321426/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Regression in cognitive radio networks for RF power prediction using compact differential evolution algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Regression in cognitive radio networks for RF power prediction using compact differential evolution algorithm","confLoc":"Lodz, Poland","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125432S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7308714","isNumber":"7321412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7308714","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7321412","articleId":"7321426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Information Processing Society (PIPS)","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7321431,"authors":[{"name":"Micha\u0142 Meina","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Micha\u0142","lastName":"Meina","id":"37072943600"},{"name":"Bartosz Celmer","affiliation":["Section of Computer Science, The Main School of Fire Service, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Bartosz","lastName":"Celmer","id":"37085665011"},{"name":"Krzysztof Rykaczewski","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rykaczewski","id":"37085363925"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3608-1065-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-3608-1067-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7321431","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","radio networks","radio receivers","signal processing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor positioning system","IPS","radio networks","first responders","radio markers","receiver signal strength indicator","RSSI","artificial neural network","mobile units"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321431","abstract":"This paper summarizes our approach and experimental evaluation of infrastructure-based Indoor Positioning System (IPS) designed to be used by First Responders.

We have previously shown some success addressing these sources of image degradation by modeling the aperture domain signal from different sources of clutter, and then decomposing aperture domain data using the modeled sources. Our previous model had some shortcomings including model mismatch and failure to recover B-Mode speckle statistics. These shortcomings are addressed here by developing a better model and by using a general regularization approach appropriate for the model and data. We present results with L1 (lasso), L2 (ridge), and L1/L2 combined (elastic-net) regularization methods. We call our new method aperture domain model image reconstruction (ADMIRE). Our results demonstrate that ADMIRE with L1 regularization, or weighted toward L1 in the case of elastic-net regularization, have improved image quality. L1 by itself works well, but additional improvements are seen with elastic-net regularization over the pure L1 constraint. On in vivo example cases, L1 regularization showed mean contrast improvements of 4.6 and 6.8 dB on fundamental and harmonic images, respectively. Elastic net regularization (\u03b1 = 0.9) showed mean contrast improvements of 17.8 dB on fundamental images and 11.8 dB on harmonic images. We also demonstrate that in uncluttered Field II simulations the de-cluttering algorithm produces the same contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio, and speckle SNR as normal B-mode imaging, demonstrating that ADMIRE preserves typical image features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model and regularization scheme for ultrasonic beamforming clutter reduction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7321693/07321700.pdf","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2015","displayDocTitle":"A model and regularization scheme for ultrasonic beamforming clutter reduction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7321700/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"November 2015","accessionNumber":"15573960","pubMedId":"26559622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model and regularization scheme for ultrasonic beamforming clutter reduction","sourcePdf":"t15b1913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136483S","chronDate":"November  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7321693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7321693","articleId":"7321700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7321705,"authors":[{"name":"Juanjuan Gu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7321693/7321705/7321705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juanjuan Gu received her B.S. degree in power and energy from Jiangsu University, China, in 2014.

As an important machine learning technique, Bayesian Network (BN) has been widely used to model probabilistic relationships among variables. To deal with the challenges of Big Data PN learning, we apply the techniques in distributed data-parallelism (DDP) and scientific workflow to the BN learning process. We first propose an intelligent Big Data pre-processing approach and a data quality score to measure and ensure the data quality and data faithfulness. Then, a new weight based ensemble algorithm is proposed to learn a BN structure from an ensemble of local results. To easily integrate the algorithm with DDP engines, such as Hadoop, we employ Kepler scientific workflow to build the whole learning process. We demonstrate how Kepler can facilitate building and running our Big Data BN learning application. Our experiments show good scalability and learning accuracy when running the application in real distributed environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321725/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321725/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15586681","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Data Science Workflow Approach for Big Data Bayesian Network Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Data Science Workflow Approach for Big Data Bayesian Network Learning","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1897a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095435S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7312651","isNumber":"7321715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312651","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7321715","articleId":"7321725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7321770,"authors":[{"name":"Jefferson Ribadeneira-Ram\u00edrez","affiliation":["iTEAM Research Institute, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7423828/7321770/ribad-2492465-small.gif","p":["Jefferson Ribadeneira-Ram\u00edrez received the Electronic and Computation Engineering degree from the Escuela Superior Polit\u00e9cnica de Chimborazo, Riobamba, Ecuador, in 2008, and the M.

This spectrum is known as digital dividend. An impending problem when deploying 4G LTE mobile networks in the digital dividend bands is that interferences may appear in the adjacent radio frequency channels used for DTT. In this paper, we analyze the adjacent coexistence of DTT and 4G LTE networks in the digital dividend bands at 700 MHz and 800 MHz. A generic framework is adopted such that results can be easily extrapolated to different scenarios and bands. Results are presented as a function of the guard band between technologies, for both LTE uplink and downlink adjacent to the DTT signals, and for fixed outdoor and portable indoor DTT reception. Also, the effect of using anti-LTE filters is studied.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2492465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7423828/07321770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2492465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423828","startPage":"24","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Analysis Between Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and 4G LTE Mobile Networks in the Digital Dividend Bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Analysis Between Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and 4G LTE Mobile Networks in the Digital Dividend Bands","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15835614","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spectrum Regulator of Colombia ANE (Agencia Nacional del Espectro)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Analysis Between Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and 4G LTE Mobile Networks in the Digital Dividend Bands","sourcePdf":"tbc-ribadeneiraramirez-2492465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06625S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7423828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7423828","articleId":"7321770","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321771,"authors":[{"name":"Abdallah Moubayed","affiliation":["Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Moubayed","id":"37085647216"},{"name":"Abdallah Shami","affiliation":["Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Shami","id":"37276195300"},{"name":"Hanan Lutfiyya","affiliation":["Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Hanan","lastName":"Lutfiyya","id":"37266812100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"7321771","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1292},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management","Long Term Evolution","Wireless communication","Resource virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","integer programming","linear programming","Long Term Evolution","nonlinear programming","radio spectrum management","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless resource virtualization","device-to-device communication","LTE network","mobile data service","spectrum utilization","capital expenditure reduction","operating expenditure reduction","D2D communication","cellular network user","higher signal-to-interference and noise ratio","multimedia sharing","integer nonlinear programming problem","smaller linear integer program","lower complexity heuristic algorithm","lower computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless resource virtualization","device-to-device communication","LTE","spectrum management techniques"]},{"kwd":["Wireless resource virtualization","device-to-device communication","LTE","spectrum management techniques"]}],"abstract":"Wireless resource virtualization is a potential solution for meeting the increasing demand for mobile data services. Virtualization allows for more efficient utilization of the spectrum, reduces capital expenditures and operating expenditures, and can support higher peak rates. Device-to-device (D2D) communication as an underlay to cellular networks is also a potential solution to satisfy the data demand. Due to the proximity of devices and thus the higher signal-to-interference and noise ratio, higher data rates can be achieved using D2D communication. This is beneficial in cases of multimedia sharing where data can be broadcast to several nearby users. However, the interference that D2D pairs introduce to cellular users should be below a target threshold so as not to reduce their performance. In this paper, the problem of wireless resource virtualization with D2D communication underlaying the LTE network is formulated. Since the problem is an integer non-linear programming problem, it is divided into two smaller linear integer programs that are solved to optimality. Two lower complexity heuristic algorithms, each solving one of the subproblems are introduced. Results show that the heuristic achieves close to optimal results while having a much lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2492458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07321771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2492458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","startPage":"734","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Resource Virtualization With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying LTE Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Resource Virtualization With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying LTE Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660688","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7321771/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Resource Virtualization With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying LTE Network","sourcePdf":"tbc-moubayed-2492458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124275S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7321771","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321776,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Fuentes","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7484797/7321776/fuent-2492477-small.gif","p":["Manuel Fuentes received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering and the second M.Sc. degree in communication technologies, systems, and networks from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Spain, in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Compared to uniform quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, NUCs provide a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain (i.e., a reduction in the required SNR), especially for high-order constellations. One-dimensional NUCs (1D-NUC) have a squared shape with non-uniform distance between the constellation symbols. Since the I and Q components remain as two independent signals, a 1D-demapper as for uniform QAM constellations is feasible. Two-dimensional NUCs (2D-NUC) provide a better performance than 1D-NUCs, since they are designed by relaxing the square shape constraint, with arbitrary shape along the complex plane. However, the main drawback of 2D-NUCs is the higher complexity at the receiver, since a 2D-demapper is needed. In this paper, we propose a demapping algorithm that reduces from 69% to 93% the number of required distances when using 2D-NUCs. The algorithm discards or replicates those constellation symbols that provide scarce information, with a performance degradation lower to 0.1 dB compared to the optimal maximum likelihood demapper.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2492477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7484797/07321776.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2492477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484797","startPage":"375","endPage":"383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Demapping Algorithm for Two-Dimensional Non-Uniform Constellations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Demapping Algorithm for Two-Dimensional Non-Uniform Constellations","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16054525","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321776/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Demapping Algorithm for Two-Dimensional Non-Uniform Constellations","sourcePdf":"tbc-fuentes-2492477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087902S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7484797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7484797","articleId":"7321776","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321779,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Sinapore"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37070344700"},{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Sinapore"],"firstName":"Lingjie","lastName":"Duan","id":"37404722200"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274563900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7321779","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1400},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Monitoring","Receivers","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","optimisation","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive eavesdropping attack","rate maximization","Rayleigh fading channel","wireless security","legitimate surveillance objective","surveillance","government agency","wireless communication link","radio transmitter","outage probability","radio receiver","jamming approach","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Legitimate surveillance","proactive eavesdropping","jamming power control","full-duplex"]},{"kwd":["Legitimate surveillance","proactive eavesdropping","jamming power control","full-duplex"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a paradigm shift in wireless security from preventing conventional eavesdropping attacks to a new legitimate surveillance objective by studying how a legitimate monitor (e.g., a government agency) efficiently eavesdrops a suspicious wireless communication link.

It is the first time that EWT is applied in analyzing multichannel seismic data for the purpose of seismic exploration. EWT is a fully adaptive signal-analysis approach, which is similar to the empirical mode decomposition but has a consolidated mathematical background. EWT first estimates the frequency components presented in the seismic signal, then computes the boundaries, and extracts oscillatory components based on the boundaries computed. Synthetic, 2-D, and 3-D real seismic data are used to comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed seismic time-frequency analysis approach.

Considering the nonlinear and dynamic property of QoS data, it is so difficult to achieve dynamic prediction while designing a QoS prediction method with unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. It is thus desirable to explore how to design an effective approach by incorporating some intelligent techniques into the QoS prediction method to improve prediction performance. In this paper, motivated by the adaptive critic design and Q-learning technique, we propose a novel QoS prediction approach to serve this purpose through the combination of fuzzy neural networks and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), i.e., an online learning scheme. This approach extracts fuzzy rules from QoS data and employs the ADP method to parameter learning of the fuzzy rules. Moreover, we provide a convergence boundedness result for our proposed approach to guarantee the stability. Experimental results on a large-scale QoS service data set verify the prediction accuracy of our proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2498191","startPage":"2260","endPage":"2269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2498191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07321781.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Service QoS Prediction Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming Using Fuzzy Neural Networks for Cloud Services","topic":"Challenges for Smart Worlds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321781/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Web Service QoS Prediction Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming Using Fuzzy Neural Networks for Cloud Services","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7321781/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15591469","publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174103, 61272357 and 61300074"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015BAK38B01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Web Service QoS Prediction Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming Using Fuzzy Neural Networks for Cloud Services","sourcePdf":"access-luo-2498191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093634S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Challenges for Smart Worlds"],"articleId":"7321781","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7321800,"authors":[{"name":"Dongki Kim","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/7358202/7321800/kim-small.gif","p":["Dongki Kim received the BS degree in electrical engineering from\n Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2009 and the MS degree in electrical engineering from Pohang\n University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2011.

Such a configuration of DRAM cache and PRAM main memory has two problems. First, it requires high bandwidth of data movement between DRAM and PRAM due to the large granularity (i.e., DRAM row) of caching. Second, the memory bandwidth of PRAM is not fully utilized since it can be accessed only by the DRAM cache thereby limiting the memory bandwidth of hybrid main memory to that of DRAM cache. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture where both DRAM and PRAM can be accessed in parallel for higher memory performance. We analyze that the performance and fairness of hybrid memory sub-system is limited by the stall time at the data queue of memory controller. In order to resolve this problem, we propose caching data selectively in a way to reduce stall time thereby reducing memory access latency and improving fairness. Our experimental results show significant improvements in performance (by an average of 21 percent), fairness (by 2.1 times), and energy consumption (by 10 percent) compared with the best of the existing methods in a multi-core system which consists of multiple CPUs and GPU.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2498549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2498549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7358202/07321800.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Main Memory for High Bandwidth Multi-Core System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Main Memory for High Bandwidth Multi-Core System","volume":"1","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321800/","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663144","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321800/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002551","fundingName":"Seoul National University"},{"fundingName":"IT R&D program"},{"fundingName":"MKE"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003662","fundingName":"KEIT","grantNumber":"10041608"},{"fundingName":"Embedded System Software"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Main Memory for High Bandwidth Multi-Core System","sourcePdf":"tmscs-yoo-2498549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131738S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7358202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7358202","articleId":"7321800","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321803,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/7430376/7321803/yucao-2498615-small.gif","p":["Yun Cao received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in automation from Southeast University, Nanjing China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

Despite enhanced spectral efficiency and spectrum utilization, the underlay network is limited by low power transmissions and short coverage owing to secondary-to-primary (S2P) and primary-to-secondary (P2S) interference. To alleviate these, we consider beamforming at SU\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and SU\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n. However, concurrent bidirectional transmissions with the two-way relay complicates beamforming and power allocation.

The resulting maximization problem for the optimal beamforming vectors and power allocation is a nonconvex quadratically constraint quadratic program (QCQP), which is NP-hard. Thus, we develop an iterative bisection search, but determining its feasibility at each iteration is still a nonconvex NP-hard QCQP. We thus generate two equivalent interference minimization problems, which we solve by semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results show that our proposed optimal design improves SINR by as much as 20 dB. We also propose suboptimal maximal-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing beamforming and maximal-ratio-transmission (ZFB-MRT), and develop their optimal power allocations. Importantly, the performance loss due to these suboptimal strategies is modest (e.g., as low as 1 dB for ZFB-MRT with optimal power allocation).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15853261","htmlLink":"/document/7321803/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Beamforming in Underlay Two-Way Relay Networks With Multiantenna Terminals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Beamforming in Underlay Two-Way Relay Networks With Multiantenna Terminals","sourcePdf":"tccn-cao-2498615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160735S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7430376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7430376","articleId":"7321803","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321805,"authors":[{"name":"Youssouf Chherawala","affiliation":["Synchromedia Laboratory for Multimedia Communication in Telepresence, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7321805/chher-2490165-small.gif","p":["Youssouf Chherawala received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure (University of Quebec), Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Synchromedia Laboratory for Multimedia Communication in Telepresence, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure in 2014.

A large body of features exists in the literature, but no method has yet been proposed to identify the most promising of these, other than a straightforward comparison based on the recognition rate. In this paper, we propose a framework for feature set evaluation based on a collaborative setting. We use a weighted vote combination of recurrent neural network (RNN) classifiers, each trained with a particular feature set. This combination is modeled in a probabilistic framework as a mixture model and two methods for weight estimation are described. The main contribution of this paper is to quantify the importance of feature sets through the combination weights, which reflect their strength and complementarity. We chose the RNN classifier because of its state-of-the-art performance. Also, we provide the first feature set benchmark for this classifier. We evaluated several feature sets on the IFN/ENIT and RIMES databases of Arabic and Latin script, respectively. The resulting combination model is competitive with state-of-the-art systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2490165","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7744634/07321805.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2836","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2490165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7744634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Set Evaluation for Offline Handwriting Recognition Systems: Application to the Recurrent Neural Network Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Feature Set Evaluation for Offline Handwriting Recognition Systems: Application to the Recurrent Neural Network Model","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16465612","pubMedId":"26561491","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7321805/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN 2014-04649"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000155","fundingName":"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"412-2010-1007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Set Evaluation for Offline Handwriting Recognition Systems: Application to the Recurrent Neural Network Model","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chherawala-2490165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1514S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7321805","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321811,"authors":[{"name":"Orlando Arias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/7352396/7321811/arias-small.gif","p":["Orlando Arias is a senior computer engineering student at the\n University of Central Florida, where he is currently a research assistant in the Security in Silicon Laboratory.

Albeit looking harmless, these nascent technologies raise security and privacy concerns. We pose the question of the possibility and effects of compromising such devices. Concentrating on the design flow of IoT and wearable devices, we discuss some common design practices and their implications on security and privacy. Two representatives from each category, the Google Nest Thermostat and the Nike+ Fuelband, are selected as examples on how current industry practices of security as an afterthought or an add-on affect the resulting device and the potential consequences to the user's security and privacy. We then discuss design flow enhancements, through which security mechanisms can efficiently be added into a device, vastly differing from traditional practices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2015","volume":"1","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15869811","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7321811/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy and Security in Internet of Things and Wearable Devices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1319105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy and Security in Internet of Things and Wearable Devices","sourcePdf":"tmscs-jin-2498605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073306S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7352396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"7352396","articleId":"7321811","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7321816,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Rezaee Alam","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K.

The ICM method accurately accounts for the slotting effect, the winding distribution, the armature reaction, the magnetic saturation effect, and the working point variation of PMs throughout their volume. The ICM method is also very rigorous to separate the onload air gap field components. First, the slotless model of an eccentric SMPM motor is mapped to one concentric model using a new form of bilinear conformal mapping, and the field solution is then obtained through applying Hague's solution in the main canonical domain. Second, the slotted air gap magnetic field is obtained through the modulation of air gap magnetic field in the slotless physical domain using the complex relative air gap permeance. The ICM method is also used to investigate the influence of rotor eccentricity on the flux linkage of the stator coils. This developed model is validated through comparing with the corresponding results obtained through finite element method and the frozen permeability method. This method can also be used as a tool for design and optimization of electrical machines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Field Analysis in Eccentric Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2015.2479562","startPage":"333","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2015.2479562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7410138/07321816.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Field Analysis in Eccentric Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7321816/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15787043","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Field Analysis in Eccentric Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","sourcePdf":"tec-rezaeealam-2479562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076364S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7410138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7410138","articleId":"7321816","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7321829,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhou","affiliation":["Aquatic Sensor Network Technology, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/7509707/7321829/7321829-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Zhou received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, from 2009 to 2013, and is now with Aquatic Sensor Network Technology (AquaSeNT), Storrs, CT, USA.

To exploit the cyclostationarity and impropriety of the desired and the interfering signals, an equalizer is designed that oversamples the received signal and then processes the sampled block by using widely-linear (WL) feedforward (FF) and noise-predicting feedback (NP-FB) filters. For the given equalizer structure, the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)-optimal WL FF and NP-FB filters have high computational complexity due to the augmented correlation matrix of the data-like CCI in the received signal. Motivated by the asymptotic property of the correlation matrix, we approximate in the frequency domain the matrix by a block matrix with diagonal blocks. This leads to the low-complexity WL design of a frequency-domain FF filter and a causally noise-predicting FB filter. It is shown that this MIMO SC frequency-domain equalizer with noise prediction is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the average mean-squared error converges to that of the MMSE-optimal equalizer as the block length tends to infinity. Numerical results show that the proposed equalizer performs well even with a moderate block length.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2498604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07321832.pdf","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2103","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2498604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically Optimal Low-Complexity SC-FDE With Noise Prediction in Data-Like Improper-Complex Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically Optimal Low-Complexity SC-FDE With Noise Prediction in Data-Like Improper-Complex Interference","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7321832/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837548","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Cross-Ministry Giga KOREA Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically Optimal Low-Complexity SC-FDE With Noise Prediction in Data-Like Improper-Complex Interference","sourcePdf":"twc-cho-2498604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119641S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7321832","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321836,"authors":[{"name":"Kiichi Niitsu","affiliation":["JST PRESTO Researcher","Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7337496/7321836/7321836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kiichi Niitsu (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) was born in Japan, in 1983.

For emerging high-sensitivity direct pathogen counting, two technical challenges must be addressed. One is the formation of a bacteria-sized microelectrode, and the other is the development of a high-sensitivity and high-speed amperometry circuit. The requirement for microelectrode formation is that the gold microelectrodes are required to be as small as the target cell. By improving a self-aligned electroless plating technique, the dimensions of the microelectrodes on a CMOS sensor chip in this work were successfully reduced to 1.2 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.05 \u03bcm. This is 1/20th of the smallest size reported in the literature. Since a bacteria-sized microelectrode has a severe limitation on the current flow, the amperometry circuit has to have a high sensitivity and high speed with low noise. In this work, a current buffer was inserted to mitigate the potential fluctuation. Three test chips were fabricated using a 0.6- \u03bcm CMOS process: two with 1.2 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.05 \u03bcm (1024 \u00d7 1024 and 4 \u00d7 4) sensor arrays and one with 6- \u03bcm square (16 \u00d7 16) sensor arrays; and the microelectrodes were formed on them using electroless plating. The uniformity among the 1024 \u00d7 1024 electrodes arranged with a pitch of 3.6 \u03bcm \u00d7 4.45 \u03bcm was optically verified. For improving sensitivity, the trenches on each microelectrode were developed and verified optically and electrochemically for the first time. Higher sensitivity can be achieved by introducing a trench structure than by using a conventional microelectrode formed by contact photolithography. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements obtained using the 1.2 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.05 \u03bcm 4 \u00d7 4 and 6- \u03bcm square 16 \u00d7 16 sensor array with electroless-plated microelectrodes successfully demonstrated direct counting of the bacteria-sized microbeads and HeLa cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15618372","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321836/","pubMedId":"26561481","displayDocTitle":"Development of Microelectrode Arrays Using Electroless Plating for CMOS-Based Direct Counting of Bacterial and HeLa Cells","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Development of Microelectrode Arrays Using Electroless Plating for CMOS-Based Direct Counting of Bacterial and HeLa Cells","sourcePdf":"tbcas-ota-2479656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15856S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7337496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7337496","articleId":"7321836","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321837,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Crepaldi","affiliation":["Center for Space Human Robotics (CSHR), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7347494/7321837/7321837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Crepaldi (M'09) received the engineering degree and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Politecnico di Torino (Polito), Turin, Italy, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","During 2008 he was a visiting scholar at the Electrical Engineering Department of Columbia University, New York.

X-band GaN MMIC power amplifiers with 70% power-added efficiency and 2.7 W output power at 10.1 GHz are configured in hybrid outphasing circuits with several combiners that include bi-directional couplers, enabling calibrated measurements of internal load modulation. It is experimentally demonstrated that the load modulation critically depends on the power balance of the two internal MMIC PAs. Despite the additional loss in the combiner, peak total efficiencies greater than 47% are achieved by full outphasing PAs with more than 3.7 W of output power. A comparison between several outphasing configurations quantifies the improvement in efficiency for both isolated and non-isolated outphasing PAs with supply modulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2015","volume":"63","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15635424","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321838/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Load Modulation Measurements of X-Band Outphasing Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Modulation Measurements of X-Band Outphasing Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-litchfield-2495127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127949S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7343772","articleId":"7321838","onlineDate":"06 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321969,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/35/7321957/7321969/7321969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang received his Ph.D. degree from The University of Michigan.

With the rapid developments in technology, underwater communications has become a fast growing field, with broad applications in commercial and military water based systems. The need for underwater wireless communications exists in applications such as remote control in the off-shore oil industry, pollution monitoring in environmental systems, collection of scientific data from ocean-bottom stations, disaster detection and early warning, national security and defense (intrusion detection and underwater surveillance), as well as new resource discovery. Thus, the research of new underwater wireless communication techniques has played the most important role in the exploration of oceans and other aquatic environments. In contrast with terrestrial wireless radio communications, the communication channels in underwater wireless networks can be seriously affected by the marine environment, by noise, and by limited bandwidth and power resources, and by the harsh underwater ambient conditions. Hence, the underwater communication channel often exhibits severe attenuation, multipath effect, frequency dispersion, and constrained bandwidth and power resources, etc., which turn the underwater communication channel into one of the most complex and harsh wireless channels in nature. When facing these unique conditions in diverse underwater applications, many new challenges, which were not encountered in terrestrial wireless communications, are emerging in underwater acoustic, optical, and RF communications for future underwater wireless networks. Of these challenges, acoustic and optical are the most compelling, and somewhat complementary, owing to the potential for longer range and high bandwidth networked communications in sizeand power-constrained modems and unmanned systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7321957/07321969.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7321969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7321969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321957","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater wireless communications and networks: theory and application: Part 1 [Guest Editorial]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Special issues and sections","Wireless sensor networks","Underwater acoustics","Communication system security","Optical fiber networks","Underwater communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Underwater wireless communications and networks: theory and application: Part 1 [Guest Editorial]","volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7321969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater wireless communications and networks: theory and application: Part 1 [Guest Editorial]","sourcePdf":"012COMMAG_GUEST_EDITORIAL-Zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03481S","chronDate":"November  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7321957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7321957","articleId":"7321969","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7321970,"authors":[{"name":"Ian F.

Accordingly, all research challenges in this regard are explained. Fundamentally different from the conventional underwater communication paradigm, which relies on EM, acoustic, or optical waves, the underwater MI communications rely on the time varying magnetic field to covey information between the transmitting and receiving parties. MI-based underwater communications exhibit several unique and promising features such as negligible signal propagation delay, predictable and constant channel behavior, sufficiently long communication range with high bandwidth, as well as silent and stealth underwater operations.

Such applications require precise location information as otherwise the sensed data might be meaningless. On the other hand, security and privacy are critical issues as underwater sensor networks are typically deployed in harsh environments. Nevertheless, most underwater localization schemes are vulnerable to many attacks and suffer from potential privacy violations as they are designed for benign environments. However, a localization scheme that does not consider security and privacy could lead to serious consequences, especially in critical applications such as military monitoring. In this article, we discuss the security and privacy issues in underwater localization, and investigate the techniques that can provide security and preserve node privacy in underwater sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321972/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2015","volume":"53","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15583827","publicationDate":"November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7321972/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Security and privacy in localization for underwater sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and privacy in localization for underwater sensor networks","sourcePdf":"015ZHU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075553S","chronDate":"November  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7321957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7321957","articleId":"7321972","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7321973,"authors":[{"name":"Emrecan Demirors","affiliation":["Northeastern University"],"bio":{"p":["Emrecan Demirors [S'11] (edemirors@ece.neu.edu) received his B.

Software defined networking is seen as a promising technology to manage the complexity in communication networks. The need for SDMN comes from the complexity of network management in 5G mobile networks and beyond, driven by increasing mobile traffic demand, heterogeneous wireless environments, and diverse service requirements. The need is strong to introduce new radio network architecture by taking advantage of software oriented design, the separation of the data and control planes, and network virtualization to manage complexity and offer flexibility in 5G networks. Clearly, software oriented design in mobile networks will be fundamentally different from SDN for the Internet, because mobile networks deal with the wireless access problem in complex radio environments, while the Internet mainly addresses the packet forwarding problem. Specific requirements in mobile networks shape the development of SDMN. In this article we present the needs and requirements of SDMN, with particular focus on the software-defined design for radio access networks. We analyze the fundamental problems in radio access networks that call for SDN design and present an SDMN concept. We give a brief overview on current solutions for SDMN and standardization activities. We argue that although SDN design is currently focusing on mobile core networks, extending SDN to radio access networks would naturally be the next step. We identify several research directions on SDN for radio access networks and expect more fundamental studies to release the full potential of software-defined 5G networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15583817","htmlLink":"/document/7321981/","displayDocTitle":"Software defined mobile networks: concept, survey, and research directions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defined mobile networks: concept, survey, and research directions","sourcePdf":"024CHEN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085247S","chronDate":"November  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7321957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"7321957","articleId":"7321981","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7321983,"authors":[{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"bio":{"p":["Songlin Sun (slsun@bupt.edu.cn) received B.s. and M.s. degrees from Shandong University of Technology in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2003.

We first introduce the main system model and framework that are considered in most of the existing green scheduling works. We then describe the main contributions on green scheduling as well as summarize their key findings. For instance, green scheduling schemes have demonstrated that they can significantly reduce transmit power and improve the energy efficiency of cellular systems. We also provide a performance analysis of some of the existing schemes in order to highlight some of the challenges that need to be addressed to make green scheduling more effective in heterogeneous networks. Indeed, the coordination between tiers and the rate fairness between the users of different tiers are important issues that have not yet been addressed. In addition, most existing designs exhibit a computational complexity that is too high for being deployed in a real system.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7321988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7321988","startPage":"175","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7321957/07321988.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of green scheduling schemes for homogeneous and heterogeneous cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2015","displayDocTitle":"A survey of green scheduling schemes for homogeneous and heterogeneous cellular networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","volume":"53","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7321988/","accessionNumber":"15583816","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7321988/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of green scheduling schemes for homogeneous and heterogeneous cellular networks","sourcePdf":"031FOH_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038341S","chronDate":"November  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7321957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7321957","articleId":"7321988","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7321991,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Shokri-Ghadikolaei","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Hossein Shokri-ghadikolaei is a Ph.D. student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

The IoT's characteristics, including an ultra-large-scale network of things, device and network level heterogeneity, and large numbers of events generated spontaneously by these things, will make development of the diverse applications and services a very challenging task. In general, middleware can ease a development process by integrating heterogeneous computing and communications devices, and supporting interoperability within the diverse applications and services. Recently, there have been a number of proposals for IoT middleware.

However, the Log-BCJR algorithm has an inherently serial processing nature, which limits its processing throughput and imposes a latency ion interactive communication systems. By contrast, the recently conceived fully-Parallel Turbo Decoder (FPTD) algorithm, where all bits in the frame may be decoded in parallel, allows each decoding iteration to be completed using just one or two time periods. This offers a more than six-fold processing throughput and latency improvement, over the state-of-the-art Log-BCJR turbo decoder, when employed for the LTE turbo code. As a result, the FPTD facilitates both processing throughputs in excess of 10 Gbps and ultra-low processing latencies, hence satisfying the challenging requirements of 5G for the first time. The number of decoding iterations required for conventional Log-BCJR turbo decoders to converge may be characterized by EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart seen at the left of the figure together with its BER. The EXIT chart visualizes the iterative exchange of extrinsic Logarithmic Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) between the two component decoders. However, in addition to the extrinsic LLRs the FPTD also iteratively exchanges extrinsic state metrics, which cannot be considered by conventional EXIT chart techniques. Hence, the novel EXIT chart seen at the right is invented for comparing the performance and characteristics of Log-BCJR turbo decoders and those of the FPTD.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"43KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7322183/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2494861.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7322183/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2494861.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322183","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE Standards","Decoding","Turbo codes","Parallel processing","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Error correction","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","error correction codes","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","Monte Carlo methods","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding convergence","fully parallel turbo decoder","error correction performance","extrinsic information transfer chart analysis","component decoder","EXIT chart technique","extrinsic logarithmic likelihood ratio","Monte Carlo simulation","logarithmic Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv","FPTD","Log-BCJR turbo decoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fully-parallel decoding","turbo code","EXIT chart"]},{"kwd":["Fully-parallel decoding","turbo code","EXIT chart"]}],"abstract":"Fully parallel turbo decoders (FPTDs) have been shown to offer a more-than-sixfold processing throughput and latency improvement over the conventional logarithmic Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (Log-BCJR) turbo decoders. Rather than requiring hundreds or even thousands of time periods to decode each frame, such as the conventional Log-BCJR turbo decoders, the FPTD completes each decoding iteration using only one or two time periods, although up to six times as many decoding iterations are required to achieve the same error correction performance. Until now, it has not been possible to explain this increased iteration requirement using an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, since the two component decoders are not alternately operated in the FPTD. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel EXIT chart technique for characterizing the iterative exchange of not only extrinsic logarithmic likelihood ratios in the FPTD, but also the iterative exchange of extrinsic state metrics. In this way, the proposed technique can accurately predict the number of decoding iterations required for achieving iterative decoding convergence, as confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed technique offers new insights into the operation of FPTDs, which will facilitate improved designs in the future, in the same way as the conventional EXIT charts have enhanced the design and understanding of the conventional Log-BCJR turbo decoders.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07322183.pdf","startPage":"2100","endPage":"2110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2494861","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2494861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Charts for Characterizing the Iterative Decoding Convergence of Fully Parallel Turbo Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Charts for Characterizing the Iterative Decoding Convergence of Fully Parallel Turbo Decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322183/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322183/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15576557","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council Advanced Fellow Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Charts for Characterizing the Iterative Decoding Convergence of Fully Parallel Turbo Decoders","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2494861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114774S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7322183","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322193,"authors":[{"name":"Hongqi Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defence Technology, Changsha, China","Centre for Biophotonics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/7471384/7322193/yu-2491364-small.gif","p":["Hongqi Yu received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the\n National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, in 2000, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor at NUDT.

The FLERIT only requires a few time bins of a histogram generated by a time-correlated single-photon counting FLIM system, greatly reducing the data throughput from the imager to the signal processing units. As a noniterative method, the FLERIT does not require initial conditions, prior information nor model selection that are usually required by widely used traditional fitting methods, including nonlinear least square methods or maximum-likelihood methods. Moreover, its simplicity means it is suitable for implementations in embedded systems for real-time applications.

Noise-corrupted versions of a binary sequence are forwarded by two nodes to a single destination node over orthogonal additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We first reduce the binary CEO problem to a binary multiterminal source coding problem, of which an outer bound for the rate-distortion region is derived. The distortion function is then established by evaluating the relationship between the binary CEO and multiterminal source coding problems. A lower bound approximation on the Hamming distortion (HD) is obtained by minimizing a distortion function subject to constraints obtained based on the source-channel separation theorem. Encoding/decoding algorithms using concatenated convolutional codes and a joint decoding scheme are used to verify the lower bound on the HD. It is found that the theoretical lower bounds on the HD and the computer simulation-based bit error rate performance curves have the same tendencies. The differences in the threshold signal-to-noise ratio between the theoretical lower bounds and those obtained by simulations are around 1.5 dB in AWGN channel. The theoretical lower bound on the HD in block Rayleigh fading channel is also evaluated by performing Monte Carlo simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2499179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07322201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2499179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","startPage":"343","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lower Bound Analysis of Hamming Distortion for a Binary CEO Problem With Joint Source-Channel Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Lower Bound Analysis of Hamming Distortion for a Binary CEO Problem With Joint Source-Channel Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15704917","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7322201/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland and performed in the framework of the FP7","grantNumber":"ICT-619555"},{"fundingName":"European Union"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lower Bound Analysis of Hamming Distortion for a Binary CEO Problem With Joint Source-Channel Coding","sourcePdf":"tcomm-he-2499179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113294S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7322201","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322203,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyuan Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8453982/7322203/chi-2498936-small.gif","p":["Fangyuan Chi (S\u201915) received the BASc degree in computer\n engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2012 and the MASc degree from the University of British\n Columbia (UBC) in 2015.

However, current cloud-based mobile gaming solutions are limited by their relatively high requirements on Internet resources. Also, they typically do not consider the geographical locations of nearby mobile users and thus ignore the potential cooperation among them. Therefore, inspired by existing cloud computing techniques, we propose an ad hoc mobile-cloudlet-cloud based approach to implement cooperative gaming architecture. In this paper, two modules of the architecture are introduced: (1) progressive game resources download, by which mobile users can adaptively download gaming resources from cloud servers or nearby mobile users, (2) ad-hoc mobile based cooperative task allocation, by which gaming components can be executed dynamically on local devices, nearby devices, stationary cloudlet(s), or cloud servers. The mechanisms of both modules are formulated as optimization problems and algorithms are proposed to solve them. Simulations results based on real mobility traces show that our system's performance depends highly on the ad-hoc network environment. Our scheme has lower system resource usage while utilizing resources of nearby devices, compared to the cloud-based gaming architecture; and performs better with short on-device task duration compared to code-offloading based architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8453982/07322203.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2498936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2498936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8453982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ad-Hoc Cloudlet Based Cooperative Cloud Gaming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Games","Mobile communication","Ad hoc networks","Computer architecture","Mobile handsets","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer games","groupware","mobile ad hoc networks","mobile computing","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile users","cloud computing","game industry","cloud-based mobile gaming","ad hoc mobile-cloudlet-cloud","cooperative task allocation","progressive game resources download","code-offloading based architecture","cloud servers","gaming resources","Internet resources","Ad-hoc Cloudlet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","cloudlet","cooperative","ad-hoc","mobile gaming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ad-Hoc Cloudlet Based Cooperative Cloud Gaming","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7322203/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18075902","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of British Columbia Four Year Doctoral Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council","grantNumber":"STPGP 447524"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271182"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ad-Hoc Cloudlet Based Cooperative Cloud Gaming","sourcePdf":"tcc-chi-2498936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146991S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8453982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8453982","articleId":"7322203","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322204,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang Hsu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang","lastName":"Hsu","orcid":"0000-0002-6429-1148","id":"37085669014"},{"name":"Kwang-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kwang-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085354548"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7322204","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1575},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"The rapid growth of Internet contents from wireless data networks, especially social media, results in unprecedented traffic volume, invoking a challenge to the load of cellular infrastructure. Moreover, instead of traditional quality of service (QoS), the demands of quality of experience (QoE) become a more practical norm, which could barely be improved under present resource allocation on radio spectrum. With this in mind, we more generally consider resource allocation by exploiting caching in radio access networks (RANs), and show that caching, as a sort of storage, could be viewed as a substitution of the communication spectrum. Thus, we propose a collaborative strategy to implement caching in infrastructure and in mobile devices simultaneously, which in general turns out to be device-to-device (D2D) communication. This new design paradigm enables great reduction of latency for requesting Internet contents and can be implemented via slight amendments to present cellular systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07322204.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource Allocation Perspective on Caching to Achieve Low Latency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Bandwidth","Resource management","Downlink","Mobile communication","Internet","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","quality of experience","quality of service","radio access networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","Internet","wireless data networks","social media","cellular infrastructure","quality of service","quality of experience","QoS","QoE","radio spectrum","radio access networks","RAN","collaborative strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Caching","RAN","D2D","latency","QoE","resource allocation","wireless networks"]},{"kwd":["Caching","RAN","D2D","latency","QoE","resource allocation","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Resource Allocation Perspective on Caching to Achieve Low Latency","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7322204/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697188","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-002-082"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004164","fundingName":"MediaTek Inc.","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2622-E-002-034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource Allocation Perspective on Caching to Achieve Low Latency","sourcePdf":"lcomm-hsu-2499193-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044337S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7374754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7374754","articleId":"7322204","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7322205,"authors":[{"name":"Long Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7322205/cheng-2494738-small.gif","p":["Long Cheng received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in control engineering from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree (Hons.) in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2009.","In 2010, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, for eight months.

The leaders' motions are described by the nth-order polynomial trajectories. This setting makes practical sense because given some critical points, the leaders' trajectories are usually planned by the polynomial interpolations. In order to drive all followers into the convex hull spanned by the leaders, a PI\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n-type containment algorithm is proposed (P and I are short for proportional and integral, respectively; I\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n implies that the algorithm includes up to the n-thorder integral terms).

Compared to the previous results on the MASs with dynamic leaders, the distinguished features of this paper are that: 1) the containment problem is studied not only in the continuoustime domain but also in the discrete-time domain while most existing results only work in the continuous-time domain; 2) to deal with the leaders with the nth-order polynomial trajectories, existing results require the follower's dynamics to be the (n + 1)th-order integral while the followers considered in this paper can be described by any-order integral dynamics; 3) the \u201csign\u201d function is not employed in the proposed algorithm, which avoids the chattering phenomenon; and 4) both disturbance and measurement noise are taken into account. Finally, some simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2494738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7744634/07322205.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2494738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7744634","startPage":"3004","endPage":"3017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containment Control of Multiagent Systems With Dynamic Leaders Based on a $PI^{n}$ -Type Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Containment Control of Multiagent Systems With Dynamic Leaders Based on a $PI^{n}$ -Type Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16465652","pubMedId":"26571546","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7322205/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422310, 61370032, 61528301, 61225017, 61421004 and 61120106010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z121101002512066"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1307678"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment Control of Multiagent Systems With Dynamic Leaders Based on a $PI^{n}$ -Type Approach","sourcePdf":"tcyb-cheng-2494738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161676S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7322205","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7322210,"authors":[{"name":"Yilin Mo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yilin","lastName":"Mo","orcid":"0000-0001-7937-6737","id":"37605284400"},{"name":"Bruno Sinopoli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Sinopoli","id":"37265687500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7322210","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2726},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322210","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Detectors","Sensor systems","Yttrium","Ellipsoids","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","feedback","linear systems","perturbation techniques","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance degradation","cyber-physical systems","stealthy integrity attacks","stochastic linear time-invariant system","LTI system","linear filter","linear feedback controller","failure detector","control loop","exogenous control input","anomaly detector","constrained control problem","maximum perturbation","reachable set computation","ellipsoidal calculus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCADA systems","security","robustness"]}],"abstract":"This technical note analyzes the effect of stealthy integrity attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems, which is modeled as a Stochastic Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system equipped with a linear filter, a linear feedback controller and a \u03c7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n failure detector.

We assume that such multimodal streams are available to a baby through inborn reflexes, self-supervision, and caretaker's supervision, when the baby interacts with the real world. By autonomous development, we mean that not only that the internal (inside the \u201cskull\u201d) self-organization is fully autonomous, but the developmental program (DP) that regulates the computation of the network is also task nonspecific. In this work, the task-nonspecificity is reflected by the fact that the actions associated with an attended object in a cluttered, natural, and dynamic scene is taught after the DP is finished and the \u201clife\u201d has begun. The actions correspond to neuronal firing patterns representing object type, object location and object scale, but learning is directly from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Along the line of where-what networks (WWN), this is the first one that explicitly models multiple \u201cbrain\u201d areas-each for a different range of object scales. Among experiments, large natural video experiments were conducted. To show the power of automatic attention in unknown cluttered backgrounds, the last experimental group demonstrated disjoint tests in the presence of large within-class variations (object 3-D-rotations in very different unknown backgrounds), but small between-class variations (small object patches in large similar and different unknown backgrounds), in contrast with global classification tests such as ImageNet and Atari Games.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and

Throat microphones (TM) are skin-attached piezoelectric sensors that can capture speech sound signals in the form of tissue vibrations. Due to their limited bandwidth, TM recorded speech suffers from intelligibility and naturalness. In this paper, we investigate learning phone-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based statistical mappings using parallel recordings of acoustic microphone (AM) and TM for enhancement of the spectral envelope and excitation signals of the TM speech. The proposed mappings address the phone-dependent variability of tissue conduction with TM recordings. While the spectral envelope mapping estimates the line spectral frequency (LSF) representation of AM from TM recordings, the excitation mapping is constructed based on the spectral energy difference (SED) of AM and TM excitation signals. The excitation enhancement is modeled as an estimation of the SED features from the TM signal. The proposed enhancement system is evaluated using both objective and subjective tests. Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD), the wideband perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and mean-squared error (MSE) metrics. Subjective evaluations are performed with an A/B comparison test. Experimental results indicate that the proposed phone-dependent mappings exhibit enhancements over phone-independent mappings. Furthermore enhancement of the TM excitation through statistical mappings of the SED features introduces significant objective and subjective performance improvements to the enhancement of TM recordings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15685448","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7322221/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Source and Filter Estimation for Throat-Microphone Speech Enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source and Filter Estimation for Throat-Microphone Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"taslp-turan-2499040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081642S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7370838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7370838","articleId":"7322221","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":7322225,"authors":[{"name":"Laia Nadal","affiliation":["Optical Networks and Systems Department, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Laia","lastName":"Nadal","orcid":"0000-0003-0798-6370","id":"37945372500"},{"name":"Josep Maria F\u00e0brega","affiliation":["Optical Networks and Systems Department, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep Maria","lastName":"F\u00e0brega","id":"37409203400"},{"name":"Javier V\u00edlchez","affiliation":["Optical Networks and Systems Department, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"V\u00edlchez","id":"37085705055"},{"name":"Michela Svaluto Moreolo","affiliation":["Optical Networks and Systems Department, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Michela","lastName":"Svaluto Moreolo","id":"38096412000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7322225","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optical noise","Optical attenuators","Bit error rate","OFDM","Loading","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["8-QAM constellation","adaptive optical OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmission system","photonic mesh network","ADRENALINE testbed","single side band modulation","chromatic dispersion","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit/power loading","OFDM","SSB","modulation format"]},{"kwd":["Bit/power loading","OFDM","SSB","modulation format"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we numerically and experimentally evaluate the influence of adopting different 8-QAM constellations.

The effect of CD on the format selection is investigated targeting different data rates using the implemented loading algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2499088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7379025/07322225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2499088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7379025","startPage":"445","endPage":"448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Analysis of 8-QAM Constellations for Adaptive Optical OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Analysis of 8-QAM Constellations for Adaptive Optical OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15716998","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7322225/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FP7 EU-Japan Project STRAUSS","grantNumber":"GA 608528"},{"fundingName":"Economy and Competitiveness Ministry of Spain (MINECO) through the Project FARO","grantNumber":"TEC2012-38119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Analysis of 8-QAM Constellations for Adaptive Optical OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"lpt-nadalreixats-2499088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046091S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7379025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7379025","articleId":"7322225","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322226,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang-Hiep Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communications Systems, HSV-TRC, Inje University, Gimhae, Korea"],"firstName":"Hoang-Hiep","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085679761"},{"name":"Mikio Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37085800467"},{"name":"Won-Joo Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communications Systems, HSV-TRC, Inje University, Gimhae, Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Joo","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37285309500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7322226","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1377},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","Quality of service","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","game theory","quality of service","radio equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","D2D communications underlay cellular networks","device-to-device communications","quality-of-service","QoS","cellular user","interference","pricing scheme","noncooperative power control game","distributed update rule","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["D2D communications","spectrum reuse","resource allocation","non-cooperative game"]},{"kwd":["D2D communications","non-cooperative game","resource allocation","spectrum reuse"]}],"abstract":"In order to enable the benefits of device-to-device (D2D) communications underlay cellular networks, two fundamental problems need to be addressed: 1) how to control the interference to guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) of cellular user and 2) how to allocate transmit powers among D2D pairs to maximize the data rate. In this letter, we propose a distributed resource allocation to resolve these problems. Specifically, the interference from D2D transmissions to cellular users is coordinated using a pricing scheme, while a D2D pair competes with other pairs to efficiently reuse the available spectrum. We model this competition using a non-cooperative power control game and propose a distributed update rule to reach the Nash equilibrium. Simulation is provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2498925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7466399/07322226.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2498925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7466399","startPage":"942","endPage":"945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlay Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlay Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15985077","dateOfInsertion":"09 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7322226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2014K2A2A4001678"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlay Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-hwang-2498925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062184S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7466399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7466399","articleId":"7322226","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322231,"authors":[{"name":"Yanzheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7322231/yazhu-2499169-small.gif","p":["Yanzheng Zhu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in network engineering from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Tai\u2019an, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, in 2012.

The proposed unified opportunistic scheduling (UOS) aggressively utilizes diversity potential present in CR by exploiting two types of multiuser diversity (MUD), one between multicast groups and another between data stream subscribers in a group. As a result, the resource usage efficiency is significantly increased, and better utility can be achieved. According to derived effective average subscriber throughput under unified MUD, a scheduling algorithm is designed to approach the theoretical throughput improvement. We specifically introduce controlled competition between multicast groups to balance the increasing resource efficiency and the risk of overstretching the limited available spectrum. The algorithm combines prioritization, rateless coding, and data fragmentation to inherently cope with dynamic spectrum availability in CR. The presented simulation results show improved performance in various situations in comparison to other schemes not taking full advantage of the present MUD potential.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","volume":"15","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"16269317","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322232/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unified Opportunistic Scheduling for Layered Multicast over Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"104-2221-E-008-051 and 102-2221-E-008-017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004725","fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs","grantNumber":"103-EC-17-A-03-S1-214"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Opportunistic Scheduling for Layered Multicast over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-polacek-2499188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122977S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7556449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7556449","articleId":"7322232","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7322237,"authors":[{"name":"Biswajeet Pradhan","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, Geospatial Information Science Research Center (GISRC), Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7322237/pradh-2484325-small.gif","p":["\n\nBiswajeet Pradhan received the B.Sc. degree with honors from Berhampur \nUniversity, Brahmapur, India; the M.Sc. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India; the \nM.Tech. degree in civil engineering from the IIT, Kanpur, India; the Habilitation in \u201cRemote Sensing\u201d \nfrom the Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, in 2011; and the Ph.D. degree in GIS and geomatics \nengineering from the Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.","He is currently a Faculty Member of the Department of Civil Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia.

Landslide inventory maps must be produced for various purposes, such as to record the landslide magnitude in an area and to examine the distribution, types, and forms of slope failures. The use of this information enables the study of landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk, as well as of the evolution of landscapes affected by landslides. In tropical countries, precipitation during the monsoon season triggers hundreds of landslides in mountainous regions. The preparation of a landslide inventory in such regions is a challenging task because of rapid vegetation growth. Thus, enhancing the proficiency of landslide mapping using remote sensing skills is a vital task. Various techniques have been examined by researchers. This study uses a robust data fusion technique that integrates high-resolution airborne laser scanning data (LiDAR) with high-resolution QuickBird satellite imagery (2.6-m spatial resolution) to identify landslide locations in Bukit Antarabangsa, Ulu Klang, Malaysia. This idea is applied for the first time to identify landslide locations in an urban environment in tropical areas. A wavelet transform technique was employed to achieve data fusion between LiDAR and QuickBird imagery. An object-oriented classification method was used to differentiate the landslide locations from other land use/covers. The Taguchi technique was employed to optimize the segmentation parameters, whereas the rule-based technique was used for object-based classification. In addition, to assess the impact of fusion in classification and landslide analysis, the rule-based classification method was also applied on original QuickBird data which have not been fused. Landslide locations were detected, and the confusion matrix was used to examine the proficiency and reliability of the results. The achieved overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90.06% and 0.84, respectively, for fused data. Moreover, the acquired producer and user accuracies for landslide class were 95.86% and 95.32%, respectively. Results of the accuracy assessment for QuickBird data before fusion showed 65.65% and 0.59 for overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, respectively. It revealed that fusion made a significant improvement in classification results. The direction of mass movement was recognized by overlaying the final landslide classification map with LiDAR-derived slope and aspect factors. Results from the tested site in a hilly area showed that the proposed method is easy to implement, accurate, and appropriate for landslide mapping in a tropical country, such as Malaysia.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2484325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7419294/07322237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2484325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419294","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Fusion Technique Using Wavelet Transform and Taguchi Methods for Automatic Landslide Detection From Airborne Laser Scanning Data and QuickBird Satellite Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data Fusion Technique Using Wavelet Transform and Taguchi Methods for Automatic Landslide Detection From Airborne Laser Scanning Data and QuickBird Satellite Imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823054","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7322237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Putra Research Grant","grantNumber":"GP-I/2014/9439200"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Fusion Technique Using Wavelet Transform and Taguchi Methods for Automatic Landslide Detection From Airborne Laser Scanning Data and QuickBird Satellite Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-pradhan-2484325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147802S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7419294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7419294","articleId":"7322237","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322257,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7430021/7322257/xu-2493201-small.gif","p":["\n\nYang Xu (S'14) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1990.

The proposed method is based on the separation of the background and the anomalies in the observed data. Since each pixel in the background can be approximately represented by a background dictionary and the representation coefficients of all pixels form a low-rank matrix, a low-rank representation is used to model the background part. To better characterize each pixel's local representation, a sparsity-inducing regularization term is added to the representation coefficients. Moreover, a dictionary construction strategy is adopted to make the dictionary more stable and discriminative. Then, the anomalies are determined by the response of the residual matrix. An important advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it combines the global and local structure in the HSI. Experimental results have been conducted using both simulated and real data sets. These experiments indicate that our algorithm achieves very promising anomaly detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2493201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7430021/07322257.pdf","startPage":"1990","endPage":"2000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2493201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Representation","volume":"54","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837279","htmlLink":"/document/7322257/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471199 and 11431015"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30915012204"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xu-2493201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178871S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7430021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"7430021","articleId":"7322257","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7322258,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Mayer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications Gusshausstrasse 25/389, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7322258/mayer-2498922-small.gif","p":["Martin Mayer (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and Dipl.-Ing. degree (M.Sc. equivalent) in telecommunications engineering from the TU Wien, Vienna, Austria, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

The proposed scheme allows quick and reliable identification of several RFID tags, even at low signal-to-noise ratio. Contrary to the widely used frame slotted ALOHA (FSA) protocol, the tags activated by a reader deliberately respond simultaneously with their assigned signature during the acquisition phase; collisions are regarded as beneficial rather than destructive. The signatures are drawn from a huge signature pool, and the set of signatures that is assigned to the activated tags is very small compared to the total signature count. This introduces sparsity to the acquisition phase which, in turn, allows formulation of the acquisition as a compressed sensing measurement. Furthermore, our formulation permits the usage of a low-complexity approximate message passing algorithm for compressed sensing recovery. We compare two realizations of the compressed sensing-based approach to the FSA protocol. The first performs fixed signature assignment - this enables very quick identification but sacrifices flexibility. The second performs random signature assignment - this reduces the identification speed but provides flexibility. A comparison via simulation shows that both compressed sensing-based approaches significantly outperform FSA in terms of identification speed and robustness to noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07322258.pdf","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2498922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2498922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFID Tag Acquisition Via Compressed Sensing: Fixed vs. Random Signature Assignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Radiofrequency identification","Signal to noise ratio","Protocols","Message passing","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","compressed sensing","message passing","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID tag acquisition reliability","random signature assignment","fixed signature assignment","radio frequency identification","frame slotted ALOHA protocol","FSA protocol","low signal-to-noise ratio","compressed sensing measurement","message passing algorithm","compressed sensing recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radio frequency identification","backscatter communication","multiple access","compressed sensing","approximate message passing"]},{"kwd":["Radio frequency identification","backscatter communication","multiple access","compressed sensing","approximate message passing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"RFID Tag Acquisition Via Compressed Sensing: Fixed vs. Random Signature Assignment","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7322258/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837514","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Wireless Technologies for Sustainable Mobility"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFID Tag Acquisition Via Compressed Sensing: Fixed vs. Random Signature Assignment","sourcePdf":"twc-mayer-2498922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111042S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7322258","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322261,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Schulte","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick Schulte received the B.S. and M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering both from Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

The use of assistive robots in \u201csmart-home\u201d environments has been suggested as a possible partial solution to these concerns. A challenge is the personalization of the robot to meet the changing needs of the elderly person over time. One approach is to allow the elderly person, or their carers or relatives, to make the robot learn activities in the smart home and teach it to carry out behaviors in response to these activities. The overriding premise being that such teaching is both intuitive and \u201cnontechnical.\u201d To evaluate these issues, a commercially available autonomous robot has been deployed in a fully sensorized but otherwise ordinary suburban house. We describe the design approach to the teaching, learning, robot, and smart home systems as an integrated unit and present results from an evaluation of the teaching component with 20 participants and a preliminary evaluation of the learning component with three participants in a human-robot interaction experiment. Participants reported findings using a system usability scale and ad-hoc Likert questionnaires. Results indicated that participants thought that this approach to robot personalization was easy to use, useful, and that they would be capable of using it in real-life situations both for themselves and for others.","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2015.2445105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7389462/07322264.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2015.2445105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cTeach Me\u2013Show Me\u201d\u2014End-User Personalization of a Smart Home and Companion Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"\u201cTeach Me\u2013Show Me\u201d\u2014End-User Personalization of a Smart Home and Companion Robot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322264/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15728237","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322264/","volume":"46","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European project ACCOMPANY","grantNumber":"287624"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"\u201cTeach Me\u2013Show Me\u201d\u2014End-User Personalization of a Smart Home and Companion Robot","sourcePdf":"thms-saunders-2445105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114426S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7389462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7389462","articleId":"7322264","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7322269,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce Stephen","affiliation":["Advanced Electrical Systems Research Group, Institute of Energy and Environment, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7953698/7322269/steph-2493205-small.gif","p":["Bruce Stephen (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree from Glasgow University, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Strathclyde.

Absence of the diversity found on networks with larger load cohorts or consistent industrial customers makes such overall load profiles difficult to anticipate on even a short term basis. Here, existing forecasting techniques are employed alongside enhanced classification/clustering models in proposed methods for forecasting demand in a bottom up manner. A Markov chain based sampling technique derived from practice theory of human behavior is proposed as a means of providing a forecast with low computational effort and reduced historical data requirements. The modeling approach proposed does not require seasonal adjustments or environmental data. Forecast and actual demand for a cohort of residential loads over a five-month period are used to evaluate a number of models, as well as demonstrate a significant performance improvement if utilized in an ensemble forecast.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2493205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7953698/07322269.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2493205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating Practice Theory in Sub-Profile Models for Short Term Aggregated Residential Load Forecasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322269/","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Practice Theory in Sub-Profile Models for Short Term Aggregated Residential Load Forecasting","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969842","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322269/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Practice Theory in Sub-Profile Models for Short Term Aggregated Residential Load Forecasting","sourcePdf":"tsg-stephen-2493205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0735S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7953698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7953698","articleId":"7322269","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322270,"authors":[{"name":"Radha Krishna Ganti","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7322270/ganti-2498926-small.gif","p":["Radha Krishna Ganti (S\u201900\u2013M\u201910) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, and the Master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2009.

As a result, they are well approximated by a simple horizontal shift (or gain) of the distribution of the most tractable model, the Poisson point process (PPP). To study and explain this behavior, this paper focuses on general single-tier network models with nearest-base station association and studies the asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity. We show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so-called mean interference-to-signal ratio (MISR) between the PPP and the network model under consideration, while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected fading-to-interference ratio (EFIR). The analysis of the MISR is based on a novel type of point process, the so-called relative distance process, which is a one-dimensional point process on the unit interval [0,1] that fully determines the SIR. A comparison of the gains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent approximation for the entire SIR distribution. Moreover, the gain is mostly a function of the network geometry and barely depends on the path loss exponent and the fading. The results are illustrated using several examples of repulsive point processes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2498926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2498926","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07322270.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotics and Approximation of the SIR Distribution in General Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotics and Approximation of the SIR Distribution in General Cellular Networks","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837532","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7322270/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1216407 and CCF 1525904"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotics and Approximation of the SIR Distribution in General Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-haenggi-2498926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083476S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7322270","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":7322271,"authors":[{"name":"Liansong Xiong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7440769/7322271/xiong-small.gif","p":["Liansong Xiong (S\u201912) was born in Sichuan Province, China, in\n 1986.

Therefore, recognizing the inherent relationship and intrinsic differences between inverters and RSGs is essential for such target. By modeling the typical electromechanical transient of grid-tied PWM inverters, this paper first proves that PWM inverters and RSGs are similar in physical mechanism and equivalent in mathematical model, and the concept of static synchronous generator (SSG) is thereby developed. Furthermore, the comprehensive comparison between RSG and SSG is carried out in detail, and their inherent relation is built. Based on these findings, the rationality and feasibility of migrating the concepts, tools, and methods of RSG stability analysis to investigate the dynamic behaviors and stability issues of SSG is therefore confirmed. Taking stability issues as an example, the criteria of small signal and transient stability of a typical grid-tied PWM inverter is put forward to demonstrate the significance of the developed SSG model (including synchronizing coefficient, damping coefficient, inertia constant, and power-angle curve), providing clear physical interpretation on the dynamic characteristics and stability issues. The developed SSG model promotes grid-friendly integration of renewable energy to future grid and stimulates interdisciplinary research between power electronics and power system.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7440769/07322271.pdf","startPage":"6264","endPage":"6280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7440769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Synchronous Generator Model: A New Perspective to Investigate Dynamic Characteristics and Stability Issues of Grid-Tied PWM Inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Static Synchronous Generator Model: A New Perspective to Investigate Dynamic Characteristics and Stability Issues of Grid-Tied PWM Inverter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322271/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15874550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322271/","volume":"31","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"High Technology Research and Development Program (863 program) of China","grantNumber":"2015AA050606"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2015CB251001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Synchronous Generator Model: A New Perspective to Investigate Dynamic Characteristics and Stability Issues of Grid-Tied PWM Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-xiong-2498933-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155066S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7440769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"7440769","articleId":"7322271","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7322273,"authors":[{"name":"Malek Messai","affiliation":["Signal and Communications Department, Telecom Bretagne-Institut Telecom, CNRS Lab-STICC (UNR 6285), Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7322273/messa-2498932-small.gif","p":["Malek Messai (S\u201914) was born in Jendouba, Tunisia, in December 1988.

The main purpose of this paper is the choice of the virtual receiver modulation index. It gives guidelines to discard the values of the virtual receiver modulation index, that degrade the error-rate performance. Two criteria are used.

One challenge for the adversary is to decide between jamming and eavesdropping. While jamming can be quite effective in preventing reliable communication of the user, it can also be quite harmful for the adversary since he/she can be detected. On the other hand, eavesdropping is quite safe for the adversary; however, it sometimes may not be so efficient compared to jamming, if the adversary cannot respond to the information gleaned from eavesdropping in a timely manner. The user can either transmit, thus becoming vulnerable to malicious activity, or be in a silent mode in turn delaying his/her transmission. However, by combining these modes properly the user can assist an intruder detection system in detecting the adversary, since transmission can provoke the adversary into a jamming attack, and a strategically allocated silent mode while the jammer continues jamming can increase the probability of detecting the adversary. In this paper, to get insight into this problem, two simple stochastic games are proposed. Explicit solutions are found that lead to the characterization of some interesting properties. In particular, it is shown that under certain conditions, incorporating in the transmission protocol a time slot dealing just with the detection of malicious threats can improve the secrecy and reliability of the communication without extra transmission delay.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

steady state of the power system and is key to the simulation of transmission networks. It is a tool commonly used by system operators to visualize the effect of generator settings on the network prior to making a change. In situations involving large networks, hundreds or even thousands of PF analysis may have to be run on the network before finding the optimal power dispatch. This process requires significant computation time and does not allow for rapid control of the network. To address this problem, this paper presents two parallel PF solvers that exploit the massively parallel architecture of graphics processing units (GPU) in a hybrid GPU-central processing unit (CPU) computing environment using compute unified device architecture and OpenMP in order to significantly speedup the concurrent analysis of many instances of a network.

Factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) present the versatility to provide a good fit to these scenarios. However, in some scenarios, the number of causes or the number of states of the FHMM cannot be known or limited a priori. In this paper, we propose an infinite factorial unbounded-state hidden Markov model (IFUHMM), in which the number of parallel hidden Markov models (HMMs) and states in each HMM are potentially unbounded. We rely on a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior over integer-valued matrices, in which the columns represent the Markov chains, the rows the time indexes, and the integers the state for each chain and time instant. First, we extend the existent infinite factorial binary-state HMM to allow for any number of states. Then, we modify this model to allow for an unbounded number of states and derive an MCMC-based inference algorithm that properly deals with the trade-off between the unbounded number of states and chains. We illustrate the performance of our proposed models in the power disaggregation problem.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Markov processes","Inference algorithms","Yttrium","Bayes methods","Computational modeling","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infinite factorial unbounded state hidden Markov model","artificial intelligence","signal processing","temporal sequence","FHMM","IFUHMM","parallel hidden Markov models","Bayesian nonparametric","BNP","integer valued matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time series","Bayesian nonparametrics","hidden Markov models","Gibbs sampling","slice sampling","variational inference","reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2498931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7530937/07322279.pdf","startPage":"1816","endPage":"1828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2498931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infinite Factorial Unbounded-State Hidden Markov Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Infinite Factorial Unbounded-State Hidden Markov Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322279/","volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322279/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16191134","pubMedId":"26571511","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Humboldt research fellowship for postdoctoral researchers program"},{"fundingName":"Plan Regional-Programas I+D of Comunidad de Madrid","grantNumber":"AGES-CM S2010/BMD-2422"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"AP2010-5333"},{"fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda of Spain","grantNumber":"TEC2012-38883-C02-01"},{"fundingName":"ALCIT","grantNumber":"TEC2012-38800-C03-01"},{"fundingName":"Comunidad de Madrid"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000007","fundingName":"CASI-CAM-CM","grantNumber":"S2013/ICE-2845"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0651"},{"fundingName":"European Union 7th Framework Programme"},{"fundingName":"Machine Learning for Personalized Medicine","grantNumber":"MLPM2012 and 316861"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infinite Factorial Unbounded-State Hidden Markov Model","sourcePdf":"tpami-valera-2498931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113592S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7322279","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7322281,"authors":[{"name":"Sumudu Samarakoon","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7322281/samar-2499182-small.gif","p":["Sumudu Samarakoon (S\u201908) received the B.Sc. degree (with Hons.) in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and the M.Eng. degree from the Asian Institute of Technology, Pathumthani, Thailand, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

A dynamic mechanism is proposed to locally group coupled small cell base stations (SBSs) into clusters based on location and traffic load. Within each formed cluster, SBSs coordinate their transmission parameters to minimize a cost function, which captures the tradeoffs between energy efficiency and flow level performance, while satisfying their users' quality-of-service requirements. Due to the lack of intercluster communications, clusters compete with one another to improve the overall network's energy efficiency. This intercluster competition is formulated as a noncooperative game between clusters that seek to minimize their respective cost functions. To solve this game, a distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which clusters autonomously choose their optimal transmission strategies based on local information. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution, which constitutes an epsilon-coarse correlated equilibrium for the studied game. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant performance gains reaching up to 36% of reduced energy expenditures and upto 41% of reduced fractional transfer time compared to conventional approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837549","htmlLink":"/document/7322281/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Clustering and <small>on</small>/<small>off</small> Strategies for Wireless Small Cell Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES), Nokia, Anite, and Huawei Technologies"},{"fundingName":"SHARING project","grantNumber":"128010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001742","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1460333, CNS-1460316 and CNS-1513697"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Clustering and <sc>on</sc>/<sc>off</sc> Strategies for Wireless Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-samarakoon-2499182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100127S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7322281","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7322288,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Merouche","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Montreal, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7368974/7322288/merou-2499084-small.gif","p":["Samir Merouche received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University El Hadj Lakhdar of Batna, Batna, Algeria, the Master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Lyon, Lyon, France, and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 1994, 2008, and 2013, respectively.","His research interests include applications of electronics in biomedical engineering and medical image processing."]},"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Merouche","id":"37871223700"},{"name":"Louise Allard","affiliation":["Laboratory of Biorheology and Medical Ultrasonics, Research Center of the University of Montreal Hospital (CRCHUM), Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7368974/7322288/allar-2499084-small.gif","p":["Louise Allard received the Ph.D. degree in social sciences from the University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 1993.","After working as a scientist at a Quebec Government Health agency, she joined the Laboratory of Biorheology and Medical Ultrasonics, University of Montreal Hospital Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada, to become a Research Coordinator, in 2002.

We propose a prototype 3D-US robotic system with B-mode images, which is nonionizing, noninvasive, and is able to track and reconstruct a continuous segment of the lower limb arterial tree between the groin and the knee. From an initialized cross-sectional view of the vessel, automatic tracking was conducted followed by 3D-US reconstructions evaluated using Hausdorff distance, cross-sectional area, and stenosis severity in comparison with 3-D reconstructions with computed tomography angiography (CTA). A mean Hausdorff distance of $0.97 \\pm 0.46\\;\\text{mm}$ was found in vitro for 3D-US compared with 3D-CTA vessel representations. To evaluate the stenosis severity in vitro, 3D-US reconstructions gave errors of 3%-6% when compared with designed dimensions of the phantom, which are comparable to 3D-CTA reconstructions, with 4%-13% errors. The in vivo system's feasibility to reconstruct a normal femoral artery segment of a volunteer was also investigated. These results encourage further ergonomic developments to increase the robot's capacity to represent lower limb vessels in the clinical context.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (D-MIMO) system, where the channel is flat fading and may be correlated, and experiences both small- and large-scale fading. We assume that full knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver and that only the first-and second-order statistics of the channel are available at the transmitter. For such a system with square quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), an asymptotic symbol error probability (SEP) is derived for the linear zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. Then, we propose an optimal diagonal power loading (PL) strategy that minimizes the dominant term of the asymptotic SEP subject to either a total transmission power constraint when the total power normalization coefficient can be fed back to the transmitter from the receiver or an individual transmission power constraint. A simple closed-form solution is obtained. Computer simulations show that our presented optimal system attains significant performance gains over the currently available equal PL system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Diagonal Power Loading Minimizing Asymptotic Symbol Error Probability for Distributed MIMO Systems With ZF Receivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2495241","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07322290.pdf","startPage":"7818","endPage":"7823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2495241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Diagonal Power Loading Minimizing Asymptotic Symbol Error Probability for Distributed MIMO Systems With ZF Receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7322290/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16305991","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A705"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1204607, 61571402 and 61501404"},{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council (CSC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Diagonal Power Loading Minimizing Asymptotic Symbol Error Probability for Distributed MIMO Systems With ZF Receivers","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2495241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094698S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7322290","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322293,"authors":[{"name":"Jalil Taghia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Communication Theory Lab., KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7530937/7322293/taghi-2498935-small.gif","p":["Jalil Taghia received the PhD degree in electrical engineering from\n KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2014.

The Watson distribution is one of the simplest distributions for analyzing axially symmetric data. This distribution has gained some attention in recent years due to its modeling capability. However, its Bayesian inference is fairly understudied due to difficulty in handling the normalization factor. Recent development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods can be applied for this purpose. However, these methods can be prohibitively slow for practical applications. A deterministic alternative is provided by variational methods that convert inference problems into optimization problems. In this paper, we present a variational inference for Watson mixture models. First, the variational framework is used to side-step the intractability arising from the coupling of latent states and parameters. Second, the variational free energy is further lower bounded in order to avoid intractable moment computation. The proposed approach provides a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood and retains distributional information over all parameters. Moreover, we show that it can regulate its own complexity by pruning unnecessary mixture components while avoiding over-fitting. We discuss potential applications of the modeling with Watson distributions in the problem of blind source separation, and clustering gene expression data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7530937/07322293.pdf","startPage":"1886","endPage":"1900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2498935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2498935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Inference for Watson Mixture Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Mixture models","Approximation methods","Bayes methods","Optimization","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","blind source separation","Markov processes","mixture models","Monte Carlo methods","sampling methods","statistical distributions","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational inference","Watson mixture model","data modelling","Watson distribution","axially symmetric data analysis","Bayesian inference","normalization factor","Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods","MCMC sampling methods","variational methods","latent states","latent parameters","variational free energy","log marginal likelihood","distributional information","blind source separation","gene expression data set clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian inference","variational inference","Watson distribution","mixture model","axially symmetric","clustering on the unit hypersphere","blind source separation","gene expression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Variational Inference for Watson Mixture Model","volume":"38","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7322293/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191132","pubMedId":"26571512","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie ITN AUDIS","grantNumber":"PITNGA-2008-214699"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Inference for Watson Mixture Model","sourcePdf":"tpami-taghia-2498935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117061S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7322293","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7322296,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Experimental data demonstrating bit upsets in 1T-1R devices under heavy ion strike are presented which show evidence of transitions from not only high to low resistance states but also from low to high resistance states. This is reported for such devices here for the first time. Device and circuit level simulations performed under various bias conditions are used to analyze possible upset modes. A crossbar CBRAM architecture without transistor selectors that offers higher density is also analyzed and shown to be susceptible to multiple bit upsets unlike 1T-1R array.

It starts by describing the newly proposed finite-impulse-response assisted envelope memory polynomial (FIR-EMP) model which allows for reduction of hardware implementation complexity while maintaining good linearization capacity and low power overhead. Furthermore, a linear two-step small-signal-assisted parameter identification algorithm is devised to estimate the parameters of the two main blocks of the FIR-EMP model. Measurement results obtained by using the FIR-EMP predistorter demonstrate its excellent linearization capacity when used to compensate for distortion exhibited by gallium nitride Doherty power amplifiers driven by digitally modulated signals with a bandwidth up to 80 MHz. This confirms the potential of ARFPD as a very promising candidate for the linearization of small cell base stations power amplifiers while simultaneously reducing the power overhead compared to the popular digital predistortion technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322306/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15635476","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Digitally Assisted Analog/RF Predistorter With a Small-Signal-Assisted Parameter <newline/>Identification Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitally Assisted Analog/RF Predistorter With a Small-Signal-Assisted Parameter <newline/>Identification Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tmtt-huang-2495362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104024S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7343796","articleId":"7322306","onlineDate":"09 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7322365,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Wojcik","affiliation":["Department of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland","Division of Cell Biophysics, Faculty of Biochemistry, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wojcik","id":"37085446686"},{"name":"Kamil Solarczyk","affiliation":["Division of Cell Biophysics, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Solarczyk","id":"37085429087"},{"name":"Pawel Kulakowski","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Kulakowski","id":"37606473900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-125X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0085"}],"articleNumber":"7322365","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Radio networks","MIMO","Communication channels","Receivers"]}],"abstract":"In the above-named work [ibid., vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 531\u2013539, May 2015], the third paragraph of Section V should have read \"The measured lifetimes and FRET efficiencies are shown in Table II.

MIMO-OFDM technology is the promising technique to provide high data rate with lower bit error rate and also improves the channel capacity under multipath fading environment. But the main drawback of OFDM system is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), whenever all the orthogonal signals are added at a maximum point the resultant peak power will be increased. Several techniques are proposed to reduce PAPR viz. Coding, Interleaving, selected level mapping, partial transmit sequence, tone reservation. In this paper Unitary matrix precoding with companding technique is proposed to reduce PAPR. Simulations are performed by using MATLAB tool; results are analyzed for different systems (uncoded, precoding, companding and precoding with companding). Results demonstrate that unitary matrix precoding with companding technique is an efficient technique to reduce PAPR by maintaining optimum BER.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322430","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","startPage":"0479","endPage":"0483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction using combination of precoding with Mu-Law companding technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction using combination of precoding with Mu-Law companding technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322430/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600131","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction using combination of precoding with Mu-Law companding technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044269S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322437,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Sheng","id":"38236502900"},{"name":"Chen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085712132"},{"name":"Martin C.

In this work we examine digital-based compressed sensing encoders for WBSN-enabled ECG and EEG monitoring, a domain that has received much recent attention. We have two major findings. The first is that using a random binary Toeplitz matrix, rather than Bernoulli, has an acceptable effect on recovery quality. The second is that, in this design space, leakage dominates over dynamic power with the result that it is highly beneficial to reduce the number of accumulators to trade off space for operating frequency. We demonstrate these results with a parameterized design and over three application domains-EEG, ECG, and small images-which together represent a variety of recovery goals and therefore compression methods. Compared with previous implementations, our new design consumes 1-to-2 orders of magnitude less area and power while still meeting timing constraints and achieving comparable recovery quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311169/7322434/07322437.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2015.7322437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2015.7322437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-efficient compressed sensing encoder designs for WBSNs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Electroencephalography","Compressed sensing","Electrocardiography","Power demand","Sparse matrices","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","compressed sensing","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","prosthetics","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","telecommunication power management","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-efficient compressed sensing encoder designs","wireless body sensor networks","WBSN-enabled ECG monitoring","WBSN-enabled EEG monitoring","implanted sensors","digital-based compressed sensing encoders","Toeplitz matrix","Bernoulli"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","ECG","EEG","Wireless body sensor networks","Toeplitz","hardware-efficient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-efficient compressed sensing encoder designs for WBSNs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322437/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589453","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-efficient compressed sensing encoder designs for WBSNs","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0191PID3825107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071105S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311169","isNumber":"7322434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311169","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7322434","articleId":"7322437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322439,"authors":[{"name":"Gongyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Gongyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37072079500"},{"name":"Herman Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Lam","id":"37270809500"},{"name":"Alan George","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"George","id":"37279801000"},{"name":"Glen Edwards","affiliation":["Convey Computer Corporation, Richardson, TX"],"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Edwards","id":"38581289500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9286-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9285-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322439","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":320},"abstract":"FPGA-based reconfigurable computing is finding its way into a wide range of application areas in which high performance and low power consumption are paramount. However, FPGA-application development using hardware-description languages (HDLs) faces many productivity challenges that limit its wide adoption, including a steep learning curve and lengthy compilation. High-level synthesis (HLS) languages and tools aim to overcome these challenges by providing familiar high-level languages and tools for FPGA-application development. In using HLS, however, an important consideration is the cost-benefit tradeoff for performance and productivity. Hybrid-threading (HT) is a new open-source HLS toolset from Convey Computer, Corp. that features a programming language based on C/C++ and a set of tools for efficient compilation, verification, and implementation. In this paper, we present a performance and productivity tradeoff study of HT HLS versus HDLs using three RC-amenable kernels, each chosen for their distinctive computational requirements. Our results show that for all three kernels, HT achieved over 80% performance for a fraction of development time, in comparison to corresponding optimized HDL-based designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

but the strength of heterogeneous systems is also their Achilles heel, i.e. the diversity of the devices and ecosystems needed to maintain them present major technological challenges. Some of the biggest challenges are in the realm of system programing. We believe that for heterogeneous systems computing to become a mainstream system design choice, high level and standard system design flows need to be adopted in order to achieve transparency when dealing with diverse devices and architectures. In this paper we present an open source high level framework and design flow that allows working with any type of device that supports OpenCL. In addition we test our design flow and framework on an N-body simulation across multiple device types and show how such high level framework and heterogeneous system design can deliver a more power efficient solution when compared to a single general purpose device and dual CPU+GPU device type approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322440/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15589413","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322440/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Aparapi-UCores: A high level programming framework for unconventional cores","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aparapi-UCores: A high level programming framework for unconventional cores","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"04853825031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062667S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311169","isNumber":"7322434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7322434","articleId":"7322440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322442,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Wei","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Ming Wei","id":"37085738574"},{"name":"Yi-hua Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yi-hua Huang","id":"37085721326"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9286-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9285-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322442","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Pipelines","Clocks","Prototypes","Random access memory","Buffer storage","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tag-based fully-pipelined vector reduction circuit","multiple vector input","arbitrary sequence","RAM","field-programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector reduction","fully pipelined","field-programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"Fast and efficient vector reduction circuit is very important to the real time application.

The geometric multigrid method (GMG) is one of the most efficient algorithms for solving these systems and is well suited for parallelization. Herein we focus on an in-depth analysis of a GPU-based GMG implementation and compare the results against an optimized preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The tests indicate that the smoothing step is the most time consuming operation, and the best performing GMG variant is the V-cycle scheme with 312 smoothing step configuration (3 iterations during restriction, 1 at the coarsest level, and 2 iterations during prolongation). The discretization stencil has a major effect on the runtime and its choice requires a trade-off between execution time performance and numerical accuracy. Overall, the GMG method offers a speed-up of 7.1x-9.2x over the PCG method on the same hardware configuration, while also leading to a smaller average residual.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311169/7322434/07322480.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2015.7322480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2015.7322480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Comparison with preconditioned conjugate gradient","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Graphics processing units","Multigrid methods","Instruction sets","Linear systems","Jacobian matrices","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","graphics processing units","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method","large sparse linear system","GPU-based GMG","optimized preconditioned conjugate gradient method","V-cycle scheme","PCG method","CUBA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["geometric multigrid","linear system of equations","GPU","preconditioned conjugate gradient","CUDA","speed-up"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Comparison with preconditioned conjugate gradient","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589437","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated geometric multigrid method: Comparison with preconditioned conjugate gradient","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5183PID3825573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069186S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311169","isNumber":"7322434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322434","articleId":"7322480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322485,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Giering","affiliation":["United Technologies Research Center, E.

Spatio-temporal alignment of registration of the incoming information is often a prerequisite to analyzing the fused data. The persistence and reliability of multi-modal registration is therefore the key to the stability of decision support systems ingesting the fused information. LiDAR-video systems like on those many driverless cars are a common example of where keeping the LiDAR and video channels registered to common physical features is important. We develop a deep learning method that takes multiple channels of heterogeneous data, to detect the misalignment of the LiDAR-video inputs. A number of variations were tested on the Ford LiDAR-video driving test data set and will be discussed. To the best of our knowledge the use of multi-modal deep convolutional neural networks for dynamic real-time LiDAR-video registration has not been presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589454","htmlLink":"/document/7322485/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-modal sensor registration for vehicle perception via deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-modal sensor registration for vehicle perception via deep neural networks","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"58413829489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100713S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311169","isNumber":"7322434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311169","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7322434","articleId":"7322485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322501,"authors":[{"name":"Firdaus Kamuri","affiliation":["Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Firdaus","lastName":"Kamuri","id":"37085720682"},{"name":"Zurina Zainal Abidin","affiliation":["Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zurina Zainal","lastName":"Abidin","id":"38236491000"},{"name":"Nurul Amziah Md Yunus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nurul Amziah","lastName":"Md Yunus","id":"37085435342"},{"name":"Mohd Nizar Hamidon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Nizar","lastName":"Hamidon","id":"37398337600"},{"name":"Mohd Hanif Yaacob","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication System Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Hanif","lastName":"Yaacob","id":"38179991700"},{"name":"Suryani Kamarudin","affiliation":["Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suryani","lastName":"Kamarudin","id":"37085737345"},{"name":"Siti Zalikha Zhukhi","affiliation":["Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Siti Zalikha","lastName":"Zhukhi","id":"37085733950"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7364-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7363-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322501","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Substrates","Resists","Films","Glass","Fabrication","Microchannels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidics","resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic channel","dry film resist method","DFR method","microfluidic chamber","microscope slides","bio components","cleaning","drying","prebaking","laminating","UV exposure","post-baking","channel making","silicon rubber","UV glue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microfluidic channel","dry film resist","glass substrate"]}],"abstract":"In this work, microfluidic channel was explored using dry film resist (DFR) method.

We designed and compared two types of the Neural Networks (NNs); series and parallel NNs. They are based on the two stages from NN's employed by MATLAB. The results indicated that the parallel NN is better, depending on the time training and the produced error. Moreover, the two stages of NNs can identify the bearing number and vibration situations. The structure of the NNs puts the system in sleep mode until the vibration is in high level, however, sleeping system leads to the reduction of power consumption when designing the hardware system.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSA.2015.7322503","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309522/7322487/07322503.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Smart Sensors and Application (ICSSA)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Smart Sensors and Application (ICSSA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSA.2015.7322503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gas Turbine bearing and vibration classification of using multi-layer Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Gas Turbine bearing and vibration classification of using multi-layer Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15589144","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322503/","conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gas Turbine bearing and vibration classification of using multi-layer Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day1S21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089649S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309522","isNumber":"7322487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309522","xplore-issue":"7322487","articleId":"7322503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7322533,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Conventional WSN architecture has limitations in bandwidth, power and storage. In case of multimedia applications data to be handled by the network is too large, which can be reduced with help of a technique known as Compressed Sensing(CS). In video surveillance applications, the main purpose is to detect the presence of an intruder or object in a particular area of interest. In traditional systems the entire video is transmitted in the network which consumes more energy, memory and bandwidth. These issues can be addressed with the help of a method known as background subtraction. In this paper CS based background subtraction is implemented for video surveillance which will reduce the storage, energy and bandwidth by transmitting the foreground measurements instead of all the samples. Performance of the framework is evaluated using parameters like precision, recall, F-score and accuracy.

We first formulate an optimization problem, maximizing the received signal power of every active user in a cell, subjected to limiting the overall interference observed by other users below a specified level. In addition, we also put constraint on maximum transmit power of the serving base station. Next, in order to compute robust beamforming vector we accommodate channel estimation error in our formulation. We consider channel imperfection as error between true and estimated channel coefficients and we assume error is bounded with in an ellipsoidal set. The resulting formulation is a non-convex optimization problem and to get a tractable solution we exploit linear matrix inequality based S-procedure. The final reformulation is solved by using semi definite relaxation. The efficacy of proposed solution in improving cellular capacity and efficient power transmission is shown by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322556","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322556.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322556","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","startPage":"0597","endPage":"0601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular capacity maximization via robust downlink beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cellular capacity maximization via robust downlink beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322556/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322556/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600048","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular capacity maximization via robust downlink beamforming","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058004S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7322560,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin S.

Information has become one of the most important assests in growing demand of need to store every single importance of events in everyday of our life. Encipherment is one of the important security mechanism to protect the data from public access. Encryption will convert the data in such a manner that only a person who has special knowledge of reading it can be able to read it. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is considered to be the strongest encryption technique in cryptography. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key block cipher which will encrypt as well as decrypt the data block. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) can be implemented in both software and hardware. As compared to software implementation hardware implementation of AES has an advantage of increased throughput and more security. In this paper we have presented the FPGA based implementation of 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using fully pipelined architecture. Our proposed architecture can deliver higher throughput at both encryption and decryption operations. Xilinx ISE design suite 13.1 is used for design and Spartan-3 for implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322568.pdf","startPage":"0649","endPage":"0653","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of fully pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Standards","Software","Hardware","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","pipelined advanced encryption standard","worldwide communication","computing networks","Internet","data confidentiality","data integrity","data availability","security mechanism","public access","AES","symmetric key block cipher","data block","pipelined architecture","Xilinx ISE design","decryption operations","encryption operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","FPGA","VHDL","Encryption","Decryption","Cipher","Pipelining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of fully pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600181","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of fully pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080626S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322590,"authors":[{"name":"Barsha Barnali Panigrahi","affiliation":["Schoyrol of Electronics Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Barsha Barnali","lastName":"Panigrahi","id":"37085731936"},{"name":"Sagnika Sahoo","affiliation":["Schoyrol of Electronics Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Sagnika","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37085662904"},{"name":"Sudhansu Sekhar Singh","affiliation":["Schoyrol of Electronics Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Sudhansu Sekhar","lastName":"Singh","id":"38542937600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8081-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8080-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322590","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Delays","MATLAB","Receiving antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-phase feedback and scheduling algorithm","MIMO broadcast system","sum-rate capacity","zero-forcing beamforming","semiorthogonal user selection","ZFBF algorithm","signal-to-interference-with-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero-forcing beam-forming","Orthogonality","SUS algorithm","sum-rate capacity","fixed feedback bit"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a strategic single-phase feedback and scheduling algorithm basing upon semi-orthogonal user selection with zero-forcing beam forming. Zero-forcing beam- forming is a spatial signal processing method in order to avoid hindrance among users. For a downlink system, the ZFBF algorithm allows a transmitter to send data to the desired users together. This paper uses semi-orthogonal user algorithm (SUS), with the feedback of all user channel information, along a base station device. Thus, the response overhead increases significantly with the users in order to decrease the feedback load and it fully exploits the signal-to-interference-with-noise ratio (SINR) preserving orthogonality at all the stages. Accordingly, in this way a specific section of users provide feedback to their channel information. Further, the sum-rate capacity is theoretically investigated. We found that there is an improvement of sum-rate capacity considering feedback bits fixed, with an increase in the number of users.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322590","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322590.pdf","startPage":"0750","endPage":"0753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-phase feedback and scheduling algorithm for MIMO broadcast system for excelling sum-rate capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322590/","displayDocTitle":"Single-phase feedback and scheduling algorithm for MIMO broadcast system for excelling sum-rate capacity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600227","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322590/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-phase feedback and scheduling algorithm for MIMO broadcast system for excelling sum-rate capacity","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053089S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322596,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085742422"},{"name":"Sukadev Meher","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Sukadev","lastName":"Meher","id":"37975380300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8081-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8080-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322596","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Image recognition","Speech","Speech recognition","Indexes","Head","Yttrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","computer vision","feedforward neural nets","handicapped aids","image classification","image colour analysis","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["police recognition","fruits color recognition","clothing color recognition","online dataset","demand push button panel","system modules","HSI color space","recursive neural network","convolution neural network","mobile phone","assistive method","audio feedback generation","computer vision","object recognition module","visually impaired people"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","color recognition","k-means clustering","softmax classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322596","abstract":"To perform daily activities is a very difficult task for visually impaired people, since vision plays a central role in almost every activity of ours.

The system is containing two modules (i) object recognition, (ii) color recognition. Object recognition module recognizes objects like door, chair, stairs, mobile phone etc. and generate an audio feedback to the user, we are using convolution neural network prior to recursive neural network which is followed by softmax classifier. Second module of this system is color recognition which tell them about object color in front of the camera, this module is useful in recognizing clothing colors, fruits color, police(from uniform color) etc. We are using HSI color space with observed thresholding for color recognition. System modules and operation can be selected with an on demand push button panel.

Further we implement Arnold's Cat Map (ACM) encryption algorithm for secured medical transmission. We consider celulas as medical image which is used to differentiate between normal cell and carcinogenic cell. In order to accommodate more users' image, we consider IDMA as accessing scheme. At the mobile station (MS), we employ non-linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection algorithm to alleviate the effects of unwanted multiple users image information and multi-stream interference (MSI) in the context of downlink transmission. In particular, we investigate the effects of three types of delay-spread distributions pertaining to Stanford university interim (SUI) channel models for encrypted image transmission of MIMO-IDMA system. From our computer simulation, we reveal that DWT based coded MIMO- IDMA system with ACM provides superior picture quality in the context of DL communication while offering higher spectral efficiency and security.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Streaming media","Yttrium","Antennas","Europe","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","discrete wavelet transforms","interleaved codes","least mean squares methods","medical image processing","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded joint transmit scheme aided MIMO-IDMA system","medical image transmission","multiple-input multiple-output aided coded interleave division multiple access system","discrete wavelet transform","DWT","Arnold's Cat Map encryption algorithm","normal cell","carcinogenic cell","mobile station","nonlinear minimum mean square error detection algorithm","unwanted multiple users image information","multistream interference","Stanford University Interim channel models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double space-time transmit diversity (DSTTD)","LTE channel model","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","multi-user detection (MUD)","multiple access interference (MAI)","multi Stream interference (MSI) SUI channel model"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322603","startPage":"0799","endPage":"0803","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322603.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of coded Joint transmit scheme aided MIMO-IDMA system for secured medical image transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of coded Joint transmit scheme aided MIMO-IDMA system for secured medical image transmission","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15600237","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322603/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of coded Joint transmit scheme aided MIMO-IDMA system for secured medical image transmission","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054215S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7322612,"authors":[{"name":"Harshal A.

Some systems are used for providing security to this data. Like these systems intrusion detection system (IDS) is used for providing security to computer networks and information systems. In IDS many systems uses number of techniques for providing accuracy by selecting complete features of dataset but they lagged in terms of time and memory. For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications.

The improvement of single-event upsets (SEUs) throughout standard or sensible redundancy may be an ancient approach for turning out with fault-tolerant systems; on the other hand, even in several redundant systems, SEUs can lead to system failure if they occur at identical time. We have a tendency to work with a run-time reconfiguration strategy to beat failures caused by unidirectional SEUs occurring at identical time in every forefront and surplus module. The planned style is collection of addition tiles containing computation cells and equivalent hot-spares. The variety of fault injection technique exists but, we find that the simulation-based fault injection way is best suited for SRAM as it provides the maximum amount of controllability and observability. As a result, the planned fault tolerant system uses the simulation primarily based fault injection technique so as to inject SEU at intervals the configuration memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600013","htmlLink":"/document/7322616/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant system for FPGA using simulation based fault injection technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant system for FPGA using simulation based fault injection technique","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046455S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322618,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It supports high data rates over wireless radio channels. Due to high peak-to-average power ratio, OFDM is sensitive to the non-linear effects of the power amplifier. So, many methods of PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed. Of these, the distortionless method of PAPR reduction is Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) technique. But this method suffers from high computational complexity. Modified PTS technique has been proposed to address the issue of high computational complexity. Modified PTS technique adopts a neighbourhood search algorithm to find the optimum set of phase factors. In this paper, the performance the OFDM system by using modified PTS technique combined with interleaving and pulse shaping is evaluated by employing Least Square (LS) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) channel estimation methods. Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit error rate (BER) are the performance measures that are employed to analyse the performance of the OFDM system. The simulation result shows that the performance of OFDM system improves with PAPR reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322618","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322618.pdf","startPage":"0865","endPage":"0869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM receiver using modified PTS combined with interleaving and pulse shaping for different subblocks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322618/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM receiver using modified PTS combined with interleaving and pulse shaping for different subblocks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322618/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of OFDM receiver using modified PTS combined with interleaving and pulse shaping for different subblocks","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055949S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322619,"authors":[{"name":"Amlan Deep Borah","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Amlan Deep","lastName":"Borah","id":"37085684970"},{"name":"Abir J.

FIR filter design is basically a multi-modal optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used for the design of linear phase FIR low pass (LP) filter. Different improved particle swarm optimizations are proposed to address different velocity vector and particle position updating scopes. The modified inertia weight of PSO enhances the search capability for obtaining the global optimal solution. The proposed modification is to monitor the linearly decreasing weights of particles. In this work we used Craziness based Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (CRPSO) and checked the optimized output to make a comparative study of the conventional PSO techniques.

The Merged Delay Transform provides an efficient architecture to implement the IIR Down Sampler Filter and It is also the computational cost reduction technique of implementation. The stability of transformed transfer functions for all types of IIR Filters (Butterwort, Chebyshev-I, Chebyshev-II and Elliptical IIR Filters) are investigated on the basis of the location of poles and zeros. It is observed that the proposed MDT introduced M-1 number of additional poles and equal number of zeros within the unit circle. The additional zeros have the concurrent position with the additional poles. The simulation results show that the stability of transformed IIR decimation filters (all cases) will not be disturbed as the decimation factor M increases. The simulation results also show that the transformed Elliptic filter is more stable whereas the transformed Chebyshev-II is marginally stable filter. In this paper, the peak error between the output from the proposed transformed filters and from the original filter is also investigated for various values of decimation factor M and the simulation result shows that this peak error is in the range of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-17</sup>\n which increases with increase in filter order.

Miniaturization and more speed were the driving forces for VLSI technology in past few decades. As we are reaching the dead end of Moore's law, now the paradigm has shifted towards intelligent machines. Many efforts are made to mimic the commonsense observed in animals. Automation and smart devices have taken a great momentum in recent years, but to imitate human intelligence in machines with existing hardware is not viable. By only developing complex algorithms and implementing software, intelligence is not accomplishable. This paper brings out the very basic differences between brain and computers. The complexity of human brain and flaws of current computing architecture is discussed. Neuromorphic Engineering emerges as a realistic solution whose architecture and circuit components resemble to their biological counterparts. This paper acts as a primer for Neuromorphic engineering. Brain functionality being analogous, the limitation of only digital systems is addressed by the mixed mode operation of ICs. Modelling of Neuron, various software and hardware available to realize these morphed architectures are studied. The gap between the software simulation and Hardware emulation, FPGA and VLSI implementation is debated.

However at low SNR, the performance of ED is badly degraded. Matched Filter (MF) detection is an alternate sensing technique at low SNR, as it increases SNR of the received signal. MF detector gives far better performance when compared to ED at low SNR. But the problem with MF detector is that it must have priori knowledge about Primary User (PU) signal, therefore we need dedicated MF detector for each PU. Motivated by above drawback of ED and MF in this paper we proposed a new MF technique by which requirement of priori knowledge about PU signal can be eliminated as well as performance at low SNR is improved. At the MF detector front end, we perform blind estimation of PU signal parameters and accordingly update the coefficient of MF transfer function. Blind Estimation of signal parameters solves the problem of having priori information about PU signal for MF detector. Performance analysis and comparison of ED, conventional MF detector and proposed MF detector also have been done in this paper which show that the proposed MF detector perform better than ED and almost same as the conventional MF detector.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","startPage":"0904","endPage":"0908","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322627.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind parameter estimation based matched filter detection for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322627/","displayDocTitle":"Blind parameter estimation based matched filter detection for cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15589098","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind parameter estimation based matched filter detection for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064521S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322634,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Chaudhary","affiliation":["Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Chaudhary","id":"37089119446"},{"name":"I Srinivas Rao","affiliation":["Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"I Srinivas","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085378256"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8081-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8080-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322634","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322634","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Switching circuits","Switches","Logic gates","Radio frequency","Shunts (electrical)","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic analysis","radiocommunication","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-e power amplifier","base station","RF power amplifier","wireless communication system","broadband power efficiency","second harmonic input tuning","PAE","power added efficiency","second harmonic trap circuit","power circuit technique","inductor","capacitor","RF-choke","output matching circuit","Agilent ADS","advanced design system","frequency 2 GHz","frequency 1.7 GHz to 2.7 GHz","efficiency 77 percent","efficiency 81 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E","Finite choke","Harmonic","Output Power","Power Amplifier","PAE (power added efficiency)","Second Harmonic"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a design of a novel RF Power Amplifier which is suitable for Base stations and modern wireless communication systems. High broadband power efficiency is observed from 1.7-2.7 GHz, where PAE> 80% when we use second harmonic input tuning. The main purpose for applying second harmonic tuning circuit is to improve the switching behaviour and enhance the efficiency for a class-E power amplifier. Without any harmonic circuitry, we obtain a PAE of 77% and after optimizing the component parameter, the input and output terminals are both well matched and addition of second harmonic trap circuit improves efficiency to 81%. A new output power circuit technique is employed for proposed Power Amplifier by using combination of inductors and capacitors of different sizes. The technique involves the use to combine the output of individual Power Amplifier into an unbalance load by use of a small RF-choke in output matching circuit. The proposed Power Amplifier is simulated by using Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) and result shows that Power Amplifier deliver 81% efficiency with respect to input RF Power and 28dBm Output Power at 2GHz frequency.

Multi-hop relay (MHR) network is one of the suitable solutions for the above demands. The standards like IEEE 802.16j and Long Term Evolution (LTE) are using relay architecture which mainly focuses on capacity and coverage improvement. In recent days, multi antenna MHR networks are becoming more popular. However obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) has become a crucial issue in MHR network performance. In this paper, we analyze the effect of delayed CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) in a system with N transmit antennas and one receive antenna, which uses antenna selection (AS). Assuming perfect CSI at the receiver (CSIR), only two out of the N transmit antennas is selected by the receiver and the indices for the same are fed back to the transmitter over a noiseless link with some finite delay. Thus this paper studied the reduced multiple input single output (MISO) systems for MHR networks which perform well even with delayed CSIT. The simulation results also validate the same.","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322680.pdf","startPage":"0113","endPage":"0117","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of multi-antenna multi-hop relay networks using antenna selection with delayed channel state information at the transmitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of multi-antenna multi-hop relay networks using antenna selection with delayed channel state information at the transmitter","htmlLink":"/document/7322680/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15600287","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of multi-antenna multi-hop relay networks using antenna selection with delayed channel state information at the transmitter","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071864S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322686,"authors":[{"name":"Bhargav Lenka","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Bhargav","lastName":"Lenka","id":"37085636612"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8081-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8080-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322686","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Electrocardiography","Heart","Indexes","Splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","Hilbert transforms","medical signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","nonstationary electrocardiogram signals","Hilbert-Huang transform","electrical activity","ECG signals","wavelet transform","data analysis method","nonlinear nonstationary signals","intrinsic mode functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiogram","Hilbert-Huang Transformation (HHT)","Hilbert Transform","Intrinsic Mode Functions","Wavelet Transform"]}],"abstract":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measure of an electrical activity of heart which is used to analyze the functioning of the heart of a person. This analysis helps the physician to diagnose the condition of the patient. As the ECG signals are non-stationary in nature, they cannot be analyzed with earlier techniques as they are limited. We therefore need robust methods like Hilbert-Huang Transform and Wavelet Transform to analyze such signals. In this paper I have employed Hilbert Huang Transform to analyze the ECG signal and plotted the time-frequency plot.

The proposed computation is based on modified radix-2 algorithm, which removes the redundant operations from the flow graph. The modified flow graph contains only real data paths as opposed to complex data paths in a regular flow graph. A new processing element (PE) is proposed which consists of two radix-2 butterflies that can process four inputs signals in parallel. A new conflict-free memory-addressing scheme is proposed to ensure the continuous operation of the FFT processor. The addressing scheme is also used to support multiple parallel PEs. As the proposed PE processes the four parallel inputs that reduce computation cycles and increase the speed compared to prior work. The number of computation cycles is reduced with increase in the number of PEs. As redundant operations are removed, that reduces hardware cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of fast fourier transform using processing element for real valued signal","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322752","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322752.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of fast fourier transform using processing element for real valued signal","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322752/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of fast fourier transform using processing element for real valued signal","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073607S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322755,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Cloud Computing is a flexible, cost-effective, and proven delivery platform for providing business or consumer IT services over the Internet. The computing capability of mobile systems is enhanced by Cloud computing. Mobile devices can rely on cloud computing and information storage resource, to perform computationally intensive operations such as searching, data mining, and multimedia processing. Along with traditional computation services it provides, mobile cloud also enhances the operation of traditional ad hoc network by treating mobile devices as service nodes, e.g., sensing services. The sensed information, such as location coordinates, health related information, should be processed and stored in a secure fashion to protect user's privacy in the cloud. While the economic ease for cloud computing is compelling, the security challenges it poses are equally striking. The security threats have become obstacles in the rapid adaptability of the mobile cloud computing paradigm. Significant efforts have been devoted in research organizations and academia to build secure mobile cloud computing environments and infrastructures. In spite of the efforts, there are a number of loopholes and challenges that still exist in the security policies of mobile cloud computing.

Power amplifiers are naturally nonlinear in nature. To have a good power amplifier without compromising its linearity, power amplifier linearization is important. There are different methods available for linearization. The inflexibility in defining the system for analysis or processing is the major drawback associated with these approaches and most of the works use analytical functions to be minimized; however, there is a lack of procedures or steps for effectively minimizing the function with various constraints. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms can be used to overcome the lagging performance due to linearity problem. The PSO algorithm provides the best solution. Therefore the PSO algorithms is proposed to rectify and find a better solution for the minimization functions. Many computational complexities which affect the performance of the pre-distortion will be avoided. The new technique will be enhanced with a criterion that reduce the computational complexities and overcomes the overall prevailing problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322762","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322762.pdf","startPage":"1487","endPage":"1491","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-distortion of nonlinear power amplifiers using ABC and PSO algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pre-distortion of nonlinear power amplifiers using ABC and PSO algorithms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600137","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-distortion of nonlinear power amplifiers using ABC and PSO algorithms","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077942S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322765,"authors":[{"name":"G Pramod Kumar","affiliation":["Thangal Kunju Musaliar College of Engineering, Kollam, INDIA"],"firstName":"G Pramod","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085734815"},{"name":"S.

SAR performance also described and measured SAR value meets the industry standards.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multiband MIMO antenna in compact mobile handsets and SAR distribution","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322765","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322765.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of multiband MIMO antenna in compact mobile handsets and SAR distribution","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322765/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600233","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multiband MIMO antenna in compact mobile handsets and SAR distribution","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053346S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322778,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh P.

But it is an effective method used for reducing temporal redundancies between two successive frames. It is also called as motion compensation technique (MCT). Many block-based fast motion estimation algorithms have been proposed till now. This algorithm efficiency depends on low-resolution coarse search and fine resolution inner search to recognize slow and fast movements of the object. This paper is suggesting a hybrid motion compensation technique (H-MCT) based on Efficient Three Step Search (ETSS) and Hexagonal Search (HS). This Hybrid algorithm effectively detects the slow and fast movements with less computation time. And the performance of this proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of two matching criteria, Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) and Mean of Absolute Difference (MAD). Results show that proposed algorithm performs better than algorithms such as ETSS and HS using less no. of search points.

In this paper, we focus on bit allocation and windowing for performance improvement of OFDM based CR. We consider two different bit allocations namely, variable and adaptive. The Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis without windowing shows that the adaptive method performs better since the bit allocation is varied according to the varying Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To improve the BER performance further, various windowing techniques are analyzed. The results show that Hamming and Kaiser Windows offer reduced error rate compared to Hanning window when used with adaptive bit allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322793.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1627","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM-based Cognitive Radio system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Indexes","Transceivers","Receivers","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","OFDM","adaptive bit allocation","Hamming Windows","Kaiser Windows","windowing techniques","SNR","signal to noise ratio","adaptive method","BER analysis","bit error rate","bit allocations","bit windowing","bit allocation","CR","communication systems","cognitive radio system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit Error Rate","Cognitive Radio","OFDM","windowing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM-based Cognitive Radio system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600164","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of OFDM-based Cognitive Radio system","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066284S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322794,"authors":[{"name":"Namrata Sarode","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department(VLSI Design), Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Namrata","lastName":"Sarode","id":"37085659363"},{"name":"Rajeev Atluri","affiliation":["Electronics and communication Engineering Department(Electronic Instrumentation), National Institute of Technology Warangal, INDIA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Atluri","id":"37085613093"},{"name":"P.K.

Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) signal is used in RADAR because of its good range resolution. The range resolution can be further improved by introducing a frequency step between consecutive LFM pulses. The resultant signal is known as Stepped Frequency Pulse Train (SFPT). When the product of pulse duration and frequency step become more than one, the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of SFPT shows ambiguous peaks, known as grating lobes. These grating lobes along with sidelobes present in the vicinity of the mainlobe are not desirable. In literatures, there are analytical methods available to find the parameter of SFPT for completely nullify or suppress these grating lobes to a desired level but not much attention is given to sidelobes. In this paper, we use a Multi-Objective Optimization Technique (Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO)) to find the optimized parameter of SFPT. The problem was formulated by taking the objective of minimization of grating lobe and minimization of peak sidelobe. The efficacy of the proposed method is shown through exhaustive simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322879","startPage":"0247","endPage":"0251","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322879.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grating lobe and sidelobe suppression using Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322879/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Grating lobe and sidelobe suppression using Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322879/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15600052","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grating lobe and sidelobe suppression using Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088966S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7322881,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnan R.","affiliation":["R.V College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"lastName":"Krishnan R.","id":"37085710357"},{"name":"Andhe Dharani","affiliation":["R.V College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Andhe","lastName":"Dharani","id":"37671823700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8081-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8080-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322881","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Computational modeling","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical techniques","astronomy computing","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I-Genetic algorithm","crater classification","image pixels","execution time","object interest intensity values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cross over","I-Genetic Algorithm","image intensity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322881","abstract":"Generally object detection using genetic algorithm in images will consider all pixels of the images for cross over procedure, it is time consuming and expensive in nature.

Femto cells will introduce more interference since all of them work on same frequency band. This limits the capacity of femto cell users. Femto cells may also introduce interference to macro cell users, this again reduces the capacity of Macro cell users. The interference has to be mitigated to improve the capacity of the users.

The simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm improves the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) when compared no sleep mode based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322883","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","startPage":"0267","endPage":"0269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation in two-tier femto networks with Sleep mode activation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation in two-tier femto networks with Sleep mode activation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322883/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600140","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322883/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation in two-tier femto networks with Sleep mode activation","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059176S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322889,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The bandwidth efficiency of the detected spectral holes can be increased by varying the granularity of prototype filter depending on the spectrum to be sensed. Here we emphasize spectrum sensing can be done effectively by proper choice of prototype filter with specified subband attenuation. The energy detection after subband filtering detects the spectral holes with high confidence due to spectral containment in the subband sensing using CMFB. The significant advantage of using CMFB technique is that the same filter bank structure can also be used for reallocation of secondary user in the detected spectral holes. Through simulations it is shown that spectrum sensing with varying granularity maintains bandwidth efficiency and reliability in spectrum detection even at low SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15600116","htmlLink":"/document/7322889/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing with programmable granularity bands using Cosine Modulated Filter Bank for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing with programmable granularity bands using Cosine Modulated Filter Bank for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061932S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322898,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The total gain, isolation and the return loss parameters of the proposed MIMO DRA are observed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309521/7322423/07322929.pdf","startPage":"0451","endPage":"0454","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel idea to design a MIMO capsule shaped DRA for middle WiMAX band application","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","dielectric resonator antennas","MIMO communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO capsule shaped DRA","middle WiMAX band application","multi-input-multi-output capsule shaped dielectric resonator antenna","feeding mechanisms","coplanar waveguide","CPW","coaxial probe","frequency 3.4 GHz to 3.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)","capsule shaped dielectric resonator antenna (CDRA)","coplaner waveguide (CPW)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel idea to design a MIMO capsule shaped DRA for middle WiMAX band application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7322929/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15600120","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel idea to design a MIMO capsule shaped DRA for middle WiMAX band application","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082808S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309521","isNumber":"7322423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309521","xplore-issue":"7322423","articleId":"7322929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7322992,"authors":[{"name":"Donatella Darsena","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universita Parthenope, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Darsena","id":"37295396300"},{"name":"Giacinto Gelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacinto","lastName":"Gelli","id":"37282077600"},{"name":"Francesco Verde","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Verde","id":"37284554800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1860-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1859-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7322992","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency-domain analysis","Correlation","Training","5G mobile communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","amplify and forward communication","cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","matrix algebra","network coding","OFDM modulation","precoding","protocols","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward secondary spectrum access","multicarrier cognitive radio system","innovative spectrum sharing policy","5G system","OFDM modulation","OFDM multiple access","opportunistic amplify-and-forward relaying scheme","communication resources share","primary user","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing technology","OFDM subcarrier","secondary user transmitter relay","precoding matrix","secondary user receiver","protocol information-theoretic capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7322992","doi":"10.1109/IWMN.2015.7322992","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","abstract":"Innovative spectrum sharing policies, possibly leveraged by cognitive radio (CR) technologies, are expected to play a significant role in forthcoming 5G systems, employing multicarrier techniques for modulation and multiple-access. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic amplify-and-forward relaying scheme for a multicarrier CR network, where a secondary user (SU) is allowed to share communication resources with a primary user (PU) transmitting with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology. Instead of minimizing the interference to the PU, the SU transmitter relays the received PU signal on the different OFDM subcarriers by using a precoding matrix depending on the symbols that must be delivered to the SU receiver. The information-theoretic capacity of the proposed protocol is assessed, showing that, under mild conditions, the SU can gain a significant data-rate performance, while not degrading (but even improving) the PU performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWMN.2015.7322992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322959","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309519/7322959/07322992.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-forward secondary spectrum access in multicarrier cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7322992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7322992/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-forward secondary spectrum access in multicarrier cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589004","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-forward secondary spectrum access in multicarrier cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Coimbra, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570184157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071865S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7309519","isNumber":"7322959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309519","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7322959","articleId":"7322992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323004,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwak Alabaichi","affiliation":["Computer Science, Kerbala University, Kerbala, Iraq"],"firstName":"Ashwak","lastName":"Alabaichi","id":"37085681976"},{"name":"Adnan Ibrahem Salih","affiliation":["Computer Science, Kerbala University, Kerbala, Iraq"],"firstName":"Adnan Ibrahem","lastName":"Salih","id":"37085698484"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6832-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6831-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323004","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Encryption","Ciphers","Standards","Correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","data protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security","advance encryption standard algorithm","key-dependent S-box","cryptographic algorithms","messages decryption","cryptographic system","data protection","unauthorized access","electronic information protection","unauthorized parties","information access","substitution box","contemporary symmetric cryptosystems","AES algorithm","dynamic S-boxes","differential cryptanalysis","linear cryptanalysis","NIST randomness tests","correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","S-box","dynamic S-box","permutation","inverse S-box","NIST test","correlation coefficient"]}],"abstract":"Cryptographic algorithms uniquely define the mathematical steps required to encrypt and decrypt messages in a cryptographic system. Shortly, they protect data from unauthorized access. The process of encryption is a crucial technique to ensure the protection of important electronic information and allows two parties to communicate and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing the information simultaneously. The process of encrypting information is required to be dynamic in nature to ensure protection from novel and advanced techniques used by cryptanalysts. The substitution box (S-box) is a key fundamental of contemporary symmetric cryptosystems as it provides nonlinearity to cryptosystems and enhances the security of their cryptography. This paper discusses the enhancement of the AES algorithm and describes the process, which involves the generation of dynamic S-boxes for Advance Encryption Standard (AES). The generated S-boxes are more dynamic and key-dependent which make the differential and linear cryptanalysis more difficult. NIST randomness tests and correlation coefficient were conducted on the proposed dynamic AES algorithm, their results showing that it is superior to the original AES with security verified.","doi":"10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323004","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310650/7322996/07323004.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhance security of advance encryption standard algorithm based on key-dependent S-box","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323004/","displayDocTitle":"Enhance security of advance encryption standard algorithm based on key-dependent S-box","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589183","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323004/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhance security of advance encryption standard algorithm based on key-dependent S-box","confLoc":"Sierre, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05136S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310650","isNumber":"7322996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310650","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7322996","articleId":"7323004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323008,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammed Enes Bayrakdar","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Duzce University, Duzce, Turkey"],"firstName":"Muhammed Enes","lastName":"Bayrakdar","id":"38503308500"},{"name":"Ali Calhan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Duzce University, Duzce, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Calhan","id":"37294452100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6832-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6831-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323008","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Fuzzy logic","Sensors","Simulation","Real-time systems","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy logic","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic based spectrum handoff decision","secondary user prioritization","cognitive radio network","spectrum scarcity problem","primary user activity","secondary user on-going transmission","data traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy logic","priority","spectrum handoff"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323008","doi":"10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323008","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","abstract":"Recent studies have revealed that due to the increasing number of wireless users, spectrum scarcity problem has arisen. In order to alleviate this problem, cognitive radio technology has emerged with the aim of using available spectrum in an opportunistic manner by secondary users. While utilizing licensed spectrum, it is inevitable for secondary users not to cause any interference to the primary users. Once the primary user activity is detected on the licensed channel at the time of on-going transmission of secondary user, secondary user must either change the licensed spectrum or stop its transmission. This case of changing spectrum by secondary user is known as spectrum handoff. In this paper, fuzzy logic based spectrum handoff decision is carried out by using data rate, channel usage, and priority. Different data traffics such as audio, and video are considered for secondary users. In order to simulate data traffics, two different simulation scenarios are realized. Besides, several priority classes are taken into account for urgent and real-time communications. In the proposed system, it is seen that accurate spectrum handoff decisions are made for different traffic types.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322996","startPage":"71","endPage":"76","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310650/7322996/07323008.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic based spectrum handoff decision for prioritized secondary users in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323008/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based spectrum handoff decision for prioritized secondary users in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589192","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based spectrum handoff decision for prioritized secondary users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sierre, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102566S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310650","isNumber":"7322996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310650","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7322996","articleId":"7323008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7323009,"authors":[{"name":"Rio Abe","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Rio","lastName":"Abe","id":"37085744907"},{"name":"Yasunori Iwanami","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunori","lastName":"Iwanami","id":"37297405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6832-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6831-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323009","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","MIMO","Yttrium","Receiving antennas","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency shift keying","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MFSK signal","M-ary frequency shift keying signal","power efficient nonlinear amplification","MIMO communication schemes","multiple input multiple output communication schemes","spatially multiplexed MIMO signal","linear matrix algebra","linear signal processing techniques","nonlinear FM signals","coherent detection","MLD approach","maximum likelihood detection approach","MIMO frequency selective channels","receive replica signal","BER characteristics","SE algorithm","Schnorr Euchner algorithm","sphere decoding","ML solution","maximum likelihood solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MFSK","frequency selective channel","ISI canceller","MLD","Sphere Decoding","SE algorithm"]}],"abstract":"MFSK (M-ary Frequency Shift Keying) signal has a constant envelope and is suited to power efficient nonlinear amplification. However, the application of MFSK signals to spectrally efficient and reliable MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) communication schemes has not been so popular up to now. Maybe this comes from the fact that the signal processing for spatially multiplexed MIMO signal is usually done using linear matrix algebra and the application of linear signal processing techniques to nonlinear FM signals such as MFSK is difficult. In this paper, we study the coherent detection of MFSK signals based on MLD (Maximum Likelihood Detection) approach on MIMO frequency selective channels. In the proposed receiver, the receive replica signal which is frequency and phase synchronized is generated and the signal distance between the receive signal and the receive replica signal is minimized. By extending the observation length of receive signal, we improved the BER characteristics. We also reduced the complexity of MLD by using the SE (Schnorr Euchner) algorithm of Sphere Decoding to obtain ML (Maximum Likelihood) solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent MFSK detection on MIMO frequency selective channels","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","doi":"10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323009","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310650/7322996/07323009.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coherent MFSK detection on MIMO frequency selective channels","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323009/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589200","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent MFSK detection on MIMO frequency selective channels","confLoc":"Sierre, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056821S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310650","isNumber":"7322996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310650","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7322996","articleId":"7323009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323010,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El-Mahdy","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering & Technology, German University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"El-Mahdy","id":"38272064500"},{"name":"Wassim Alexan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering & Technology, German University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"Alexan","id":"37085380491"},{"name":"Nerin Ashraf","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering & Technology, German University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Nerin","lastName":"Ashraf","id":"37085705194"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6832-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6831-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323010","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of two way DF relaying with co-channel interference and channel estimation error","abstract":"One of the major problems of wireless communication is the channel estimation error and co-channel interference, which causes degradation in the performance of the system. Cooperative communication is one of the most efficient techniques to enhance the performance of wireless systems in the presence of channel estimation error and co-channel interference. In this paper, the performance of decode and forward two-way relay network (TWRN) scheme is evaluated in presence of channel estimation error and co-channel interference. The performance is evaluated analytically in terms of a metric called signal-to-noise gap ratio, which measures the reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio due to channel estimation error and co-channel interference. The effect of different parameters on the performance of the two way relaying scheme is studied. It is that TWRN, cooperative communications not only enhance the BER performance but also reduce the effect of channel estimation error and/ or co-channel interference.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310650/7322996/07323010.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323010","doi":"10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323010","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323010","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Interchannel interference","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cochannel interference","decode and forward communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two way DF relaying","co-channel interference","channel estimation error","wireless communication","cooperative communication","wireless systems","decode and forward two-way relay network","signal-to-noise gap ratio","two way relaying scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two way relaying","Decode and Forward","Cooperative Communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323010/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of two way DF relaying with co-channel interference and channel estimation error","accessionNumber":"15589165","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323010/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of two way DF relaying with co-channel interference and channel estimation error","confLoc":"Sierre, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068952S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310650","isNumber":"7322996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310650","xplore-issue":"7322996","articleId":"7323010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7323015,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Canhao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Thomas Canhao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37546829800"},{"name":"Ville Lepp\u00e4nen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Lepp\u00e4nen","id":"37345469800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6832-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6831-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323015","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Multicore processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Measurement","Artificial intelligence","Databases","Greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cache storage","greedy algorithms","parallel programming","search problems","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache-aware mapping algorithm","memory-aware mapping algorithm","big data applications","parallel programs","data processing","massive parallel systems","shared cache-memory multicore processor","cache subsystem latency analysis","memory subsystem latency analysis","memory latency optimization","intraapplication latency","efficient greedy algorithm","search space","first fit algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and investigate a task mapping algorithm for big data applications. As a critical resource, data are produced faster than ever before. Parallel programs that process these data on massive parallel systems are widely adopted. The task mapping algorithm however, has not been well optimized for these applications. We explore the characteristics of big data applications based on a shared cache/memory multicore processor. The latencies of cache and memory sub-systems are analysed. The proposed algorithm is designed to optimize the cache/memory latency, as well as intra-application latency. We introduce an efficient greedy algorithm to calculate the mapping result based on the congregate degree of nodes. Different numbers of search spaces are discussed and evaluated. Experiments are conducted based on synthetic simulation and running real applications on a full system simulation environment. Results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Average execution time of five selected big data applications is reduced by 8% compared with the first fit algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cache- and memory-aware mapping algorithm for big data applications","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","doi":"10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323015","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310650/7322996/07323015.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A cache- and memory-aware mapping algorithm for big data applications","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323015/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589197","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cache- and memory-aware mapping algorithm for big data applications","confLoc":"Sierre, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.222748S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310650","isNumber":"7322996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310650","xplore-issue":"7322996","articleId":"7323015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323200,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Veigel","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Elektrotechnisches Institut (ETI) -Hybrid Electric Vehicles Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Veigel","id":"37085675526"},{"name":"Patrick Winzer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Elektrotechnisches Institut (ETI) -Hybrid Electric Vehicles Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Winzer","id":"37085549444"},{"name":"Jan Richter","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Elektrotechnisches Institut (ETI) -Hybrid Electric Vehicles Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Richter","id":"37085353289"},{"name":"Martin Doppelbauer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Elektrotechnisches Institut (ETI) -Hybrid Electric Vehicles Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Doppelbauer","id":"37085348767"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7512-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7511-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323200","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"abstract":"The identification and characterization of magnetic losses in electrical steel is the basis for the improvement of current drive technologies and quality assurance in the manufacturing processes. The enormous demands on drives regarding high frequencies, non-sinusoidal waveforms and polarizations in the area of the saturation flux density yield increased requirements for suitable testing devices. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new measuring system that combines the requirements of series production and measurement precision. As a second step it is possible to establish a measurement strategy that differ and separate the influence on the magnetic losses of every single production step inside the manufacturing process. For this application a fast, flexible and high performant modular measuring device is built up and is described in this paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Magnetic

These sheets are frequently made of non-grain-oriented electrical steel, fully finished, and produced by means of stamping. A cost efficient production requires prolonging tool life by reducing tool wear. Hence, the presented work aims at analyzing wear behavior of stamping tools in the process of stamping electrical steel sheets with baked varnish insulating coating. Based on stamping tests, a series of long-term experiments with initially sharp cutting elements made of hardened tool steel was conducted over a period of several hundred thousand punching strokes. The number of strokes was analyzed with regard to its effects upon defined abrasion parameters at the cutting edges as well as upon burr and cut surface at the produced electrical sheet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323218/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15600376","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of wear behavior of stamping tools in the production of electrical steel sheets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of wear behavior of stamping tools in the production of electrical steel sheets","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"16003AnalysisofKraemer3833011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054551S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311171","isNumber":"7323187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311171","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7323187","articleId":"7323218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7323237,"authors":[{"name":"Ranim El Ahdab","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Near East University, Cyprus, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ranim El","lastName":"Ahdab","id":"37086584271"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6516-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6515-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5696"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5688"}],"articleNumber":"7323237","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Training","Diseases","Testing","Zinc","Neurons","Ions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biomedical engineering","diseases","medical disorders","neural nets","toxicology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anorexia nervosa","passion-red blood","back propagation neural network","ion concentration","toxicity","anorexia disorder","ghost-eating disorder","BPNN system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anorexia","anorexia detection","BPNN","ions","elements alteration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323237","abstract":"Anorexia nervosa is a quiet dangerous disease that detected in an early stage may save the patient life and flushes his veins with \u201cpassion-red blood\u201d pumping happiness and hope with every heartbeat.

The problem being studied concerns the optimal estimation of structure and parameters network. The common training algorithms such as gradient descent techniques are frequently used for NFS. However, they cannot possibly find the global optimum, which declines the network performance. The PSO is an optimization tool favoring global search in the feature space, constitutes therefore a more suitable method. The main purpose is to use the outstanding features of PSO in NFS training for any image processing function approximation. As illustration, we consider image denoising. The performance of the proposed method is validated on an image set and a comparison with other techniques is done. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate that such system is strongly adaptive with respect to the noise type and leading to good restored images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323238/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15600446","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323238/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neuro-fuzzy system based on particle swarm optimization algorithm for image denoising application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuro-fuzzy system based on particle swarm optimization algorithm for image denoising application","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"p9elloumi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098577S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312261","isNumber":"7323232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312261","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7323232","articleId":"7323238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323241,"authors":[{"name":"Ebenezer O.

Nonlinear interactions during propagation are another source of correlated phase noise. In this paper, we show through simulations and in experiments that blind decision-directed (DD) CPE with regular block lengths removes a large portion of the memory. This makes it virtually impossible in practice to quantify correlations that come from propagation effects, or to obtain rate gains by exploiting the nonlinear phase noise (NLPN). Larger CPE block lengths leave the memory partly intact. This, however, comes at the expense of reduced information rates. We are able to fully recover this rate loss in simulations by using idealized processing of phase distortions. In experiments with full DSP, an almost full rate recovery is reported.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIWDC.2015.7323331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323317","publicationTitle":"2015 Tyrrhenian International Workshop on Digital Communications (TIWDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Tyrrhenian International Workshop on Digital Communications (TIWDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307715/7323317/07323331.pdf","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of carrier phase estimation on phase correlations in coherent fiber transmission","doi":"10.1109/TIWDC.2015.7323331","startPage":"35","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of carrier phase estimation on phase correlations in coherent fiber transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323331/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15588990","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323331/","conferenceDate":"22-22 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of carrier phase estimation on phase correlations in coherent fiber transmission","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570176153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055701S","chronDate":"22-22 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307715","isNumber":"7323317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307715","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7323317","articleId":"7323331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7323334,"authors":[{"name":"Mengdi Song","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Mengdi","lastName":"Song","id":"37074145500"},{"name":"Erwan Pincemin","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Pincemin","id":"37271489600"},{"name":"Vassiliki Vgenopoulou","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassiliki","lastName":"Vgenopoulou","id":"38095319700"},{"name":"Ioannis Roudas","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Roudas","id":"37275033700"},{"name":"El-Mehdi Amhoud","affiliation":["CNRS UMR5141, Institut Mines-Telecom, Paris, France"],"firstName":"El-Mehdi","lastName":"Amhoud","id":"37085708029"},{"name":"Yves Jaou\u00ebn","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Jaou\u00ebn","id":"37085423797"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9260-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9259-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323334","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Digital communication","Zirconium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","equalisers","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear mitigation technique","coherent 16-QAM multiband OFDM transmission performance","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","fibre-based WDM transmission line","Volterra-based nonlinear equalizer","digital backpropagation-based nonlinear equalizer","interchannel nonlinearity","bit rate 400 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["400 Gbps MB-OFDM","WDM transmission","nonlinear mitigation techniques"]}],"abstract":"We experimentally study the transmission of a 400 Gbps coherent 16-QAM multi-band OFDM superchannel over a 10\u00d7100 km G.652 fibre-based WDM transmission line.

However, most of hybrid precoding schemes consider the complicated full-connected architecture. In this paper, we focus on the more energy-efficient sub-connected architecture, and propose a low-complexity hybrid precoding based on successive interference cancelation (SIC). The basic idea of SIC-based hybrid precoding is to decompose the total capacity optimization problem into a series of sub-problems, each of which only considers one sub-antenna array. Then, we can optimize the capacity of each sub-antenna array one by one until the last sub-antenna array is considered. Simulation results verify that SIC-based hybrid precoding can achieve the near-optimal performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Radio and Antenna Days of the Indian Ocean (RADIO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7317693/7323359/07323368.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2015 Radio and Antenna Days of the Indian Ocean (RADIO)","doi":"10.1109/RADIO.2015.7323368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADIO.2015.7323368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding based on successive interference cancelation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Radio frequency","MIMO","Energy efficiency","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference suppression","MIMO communication","precoding","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient hybrid precoding","successive interference cancelation","millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","signal attenuation","RF chains","sub-antenna array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding based on successive interference cancelation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601129","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding based on successive interference cancelation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Belle Mare, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"TechnicalArticle008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038917S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317693","isNumber":"7323359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317693","xplore-issue":"7323359","articleId":"7323368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Radio Society (Mauritius)","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323370,"authors":[{"name":"Tamal Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Tamal","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37862047000"},{"name":"Iti Saha Misra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Iti Saha","lastName":"Misra","id":"38186220300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-9903-7339-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-9903-7338-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7323370","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Sensors","Delays","Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Heuristic algorithms","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Internet telephony","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time spectrum handoff algorithm","VoIP","cognitive radio networks","secondary users","primary users","voice over IP","quality of service","proreact-proactive and reactive handoff","channel selection mechanisms","spectrum handoff delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323370","doi":"10.1109/RADIO.2015.7323370","publicationTitle":"2015 Radio and Antenna Days of the Indian Ocean (RADIO)","abstract":"Secondary Users (SUs) in a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) face unpredictable interruptions in transmission due to the random arrival of Primary Users (PUs), leading to spectrum handoff or dropping instances. An efficient spectrum handoff algorithm, thus, becomes one of the indispensable components in CRN, especially for real-time communication like Voice over IP (VoIP). In this regard, this paper investigates the effects of spectrum handoff on the Quality of Service (QoS) for VoIP traffic in CRN, and proposes a real-time spectrum handoff algorithm in two phases. The first phase (VAST-VoIP based Adaptive Sensing and Transmission) adaptively varies the channel sensing and transmission durations to perform intelligent dropping decisions. The second phase (ProReact-Proactive and Reactive Handoff) deploys efficient channel selection mechanisms during spectrum handoff for resuming communication. Extensive performance analysis in analytical and simulation models confirms a decrease in spectrum handoff delay for VoIP SUs by more than 40% and 60%, compared to existing proactive and reactive algorithms, respectively and ensures a minimum 10% reduction in call-dropping probability with respect to the previous works in this domain. The effective SU transmission duration is also maximized under the proposed algorithm, thereby making it suitable for successful VoIP communication.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADIO.2015.7323370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323359","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Radio and Antenna Days of the Indian Ocean (RADIO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7317693/7323359/07323370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing a real-time spectrum handoff algorithm for VoIP based Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323370/","displayDocTitle":"Designing a real-time spectrum handoff algorithm for VoIP based Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601092","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing a real-time spectrum handoff algorithm for VoIP based Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Belle Mare, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"TechnicalArticle010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037845S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317693","isNumber":"7323359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317693","xplore-issue":"7323359","articleId":"7323370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Radio Society (Mauritius)","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323379,"authors":[{"name":"Neelam Chandwani","affiliation":["Dept. of Elex. and Telecomm, S.G.S.I.T.S., Indore, India"],"firstName":"Neelam","lastName":"Chandwani","id":"37085632157"},{"name":"Anjana Jain","affiliation":["Dept. of Elex. and Telecomm, S.G.S.I.T.S., Indore, India"],"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Jain","id":"37422241500"},{"name":"Prakash D.

Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques have become reliable solution for solving spectral congestion problem. For utilization of unused electromagnetic spectrum in a cognitive radio network, it is necessary for secondary users to monitor the available spectrum (allocated to primary users) and identify the free spectrum (spectrum holes). In this paper primary user signal and channel noise conditions are discussed. Earlier literature has worked on one of these conditions. What are these conditions? Primary user signal and channel noise can be real valued signal or complex valued signal. There modulation schemes may also be different. In this paper classification of primary user signal and channel noise is discussed. The probability of false alarm, probability of detection and throughput of secondary network (user) is calculated and a comparison of throughput of secondary user for different conditions of primary user signal and channel noise is being presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15601131","htmlLink":"/document/7323379/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Throughput comparison for Cognitive Radio network under various conditions of primary user and channel noise signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput comparison for Cognitive Radio network under various conditions of primary user and channel noise signals","confLoc":"Belle Mare, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"TechnicalArticle019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049154S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7317693","isNumber":"7323359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7317693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7323359","articleId":"7323379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Radio Society (Mauritius)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7323452,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Takiguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Takiguchi","id":"37278576300"},{"name":"Yukihiro Ikeyama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Ikeyama","id":"37085699886"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7465-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7464-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8081"}],"articleNumber":"7323452","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical coupling","Integrated optics","Optical losses","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demultiplexing","density functional theory","integrated optics","OFDM modulation","optical arrays","optical communication equipment","optical fibre communication","optical fibre couplers","optical fibre filters","optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated-optic filter","variable symbol rate optical OFDM signals","waveguide-type optical filter","optical OFDM signal demultiplexing","symbol rate subcarriers","star coupler-based optical DFT circuit","optical switch array"]}],"abstract":"We report a waveguide-type optical filter that can demultiplex an optical OFDM signal with various symbol rate sub-carriers.

The investigated schemes are the optical discrete Fourier transformation (O-DFT) and the optical spectral magnification (SM) based on time lenses. In the former scheme, cascaded delay-interferometers (DIs) are used to perform the O-DFT, with subsequent active optical gating to remove the intercarrier interference (ICI). Here a reduced-complexity partial O-DFT, realized by replacing a number of DIs with optical bandpass filters, is investigated. In the latter scheme the OFDM spectrum is magnified, allowing for simple optical bandpass filtering of the individual subcarriers with reduced ICI. Ideally only a single unit consisting of two time lenses is needed, reducing the complexity and potentially the energy consumption compared to the type of O-DFT scheme relying on many active gates. The bit-error-rate is estimated down to ~10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n by Monte Carlo bit-error counting for a 32-subcarrier OFDM input signal, showing that a performance close to the ideal O-DFT is achievable for both the reduced-complexity O-DFT and the SM scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

We first study the benefit and penalty differences of Gray and differential coding, and then experimentally compare OSNR sensitivities and transmission performance using flexible transceiver configuration and the same EDFA-only SSMF link. Experimental results show the implementation penalties are 1.85 dB for 42-GBaud PM-8QAM, which is 1 dB and 1.5 dB better than 32-GBaud PM-16QAM and 25-GBaud PM-32QAM at 5.92-dB Q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-factor (corresponding to a BER of 2.4E-2), respectively. It is also found that maximum reaches of 2460 km for 42.6-GBaud PM-8QAM, 1640 km for 32-GBaud 16QAM, and 820 km for 25-GBaud PM-32QAM are achieved. Furthermore, the performances of cascaded multi-modulus algorithm (CMMA) and decision-directed least mean square (DD-LMS) algorithms are also compared. The improvement by addition of one sample/symbol based DD-LMS digital filter is investigated as well.","doi":"10.1109/IPCon.2015.7323715","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Photonics Conference (IPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Photonics Conference (IPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312535/7323434/07323715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPCon.2015.7323715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323434","startPage":"413","endPage":"416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-carrier 400G solutions based on 8/16/32-QAM modulation formats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-carrier 400G solutions based on 8/16/32-QAM modulation formats","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15600607","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-carrier 400G solutions based on 8/16/32-QAM modulation formats","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"336815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093763S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312535","isNumber":"7323434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312535","xplore-issue":"7323434","articleId":"7323715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7323716,"authors":[{"name":"Pau Medina","affiliation":["Instiruto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Medina","id":"37085499877"},{"name":"Vicen\u00e7 Almenar","affiliation":["Instiruto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicen\u00e7","lastName":"Almenar","id":"37271834700"},{"name":"Juan Luis Corral","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Center, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Luis","lastName":"Corral","id":"37277696600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7465-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7464-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8081"}],"articleNumber":"7323716","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Bit error rate","Optical fiber communication","Optical fiber losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","equalisers","OFDM modulation","optical links","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data detection scheme","zero padded OFDM signals","MMF links","receiver","single-tap equalizer","successive interference cancellation detection","numerical simulations","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"Proroposed receiver for zero padded OFDM combines single-tap equalizer and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection.

This paper addresses software defined network (SDN) as the central controller of radio resource management (RRM) in next generation mobile networks. We proposed a novel SDN Architecture for Future 5G Networks where SDN is responsible for collecting and managing huge spacial domain information and processing null-space calculation regarding massive MIMO coordination. In this architecture, user information is first collected by BS/LPNs and then reported to SDN. SDN controller will perform the information processing such as CSI analysis and null-space calculation. SDN controller also sends the processed results and instructions back to BS and LPNs so as to achieve better coordination regarding the global knowledge of network spatial information. In our proposed architecture, SDN takes over the heavy operation from BS and LPNs to release the efficiency of 5G networks. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight CSI acquisition based null-space precoding scheme for the implementation. Numerical simulation results justify that our proposed system can significantly improve the SINR of intended users in LPN-covered small cells, while oppressing the impact on neighboring victim users.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"42KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7323784/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2498609.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7323784/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2498609.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE Standards","5G mobile communication","Channel estimation","Precoding","MIMO","Heterogeneous networks","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","linear predictive coding","MIMO communication","quality of service","software defined networking","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","linear precoding","channel state information","information management","radio resource management","HetNets","heterogeneous networks","5G mobile communication systems","5G SDN","software-defined network","massive MIMO coordination","multiple-input multiple-output","spatial domain management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G SDN","massive MIMO","HetNets","precoding","channel estimation"]},{"kwd":["5G SDN","massive MIMO","HetNets","precoding","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"In 5G mobile communication systems, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and heterogeneous networks (HetNets) play crucial roles to achieve expected coverage and capacity across venues. This paper correspondingly addresses software-defined network (SDN) as the central controller of radio resource management in massive MIMO HetNets. In particular, we identify the huge spatial domain information management and complicated MIMO coordination as the grand challenges in 5G systems. Our work accordingly distinguishes itself by considering more network MIMO aspects, including flexibility and complexity of spatial coordination. In our proposed scheme, SDN controller first collects the user channel-state information in an effective way, and then calculates the null-space of victim users and applies linear precoding to that null-space. Simulation results show that our design is highly beneficial and easy to be deployed, due to its high quality of service performance but low computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2498609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07323784.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2498609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Domain Management and Massive MIMO Coordination in 5G SDN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323784","topic":"Recent Advances in Software Defined Networking for 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Domain Management and Massive MIMO Coordination in 5G SDN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323784/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15591465","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323784/","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spatial Domain Management and Massive MIMO Coordination in 5G SDN","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2498609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120906S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Recent Advances in Software Defined Networking for 5G Networks"],"articleId":"7323784","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7323791,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Hu","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, 2052, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7401148/7323791/hu-2499308-small.gif","p":["Ke Hu received the B.Eng. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, and the M.Eng. degree from Xinjiang University, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

This paper describes the design and evaluation of a low-cost participatory sensing system called HazeWatch that uses a combination of portable mobile sensor units, smart-phones, cloud computing, and mobile apps to measure, model, and personalize air pollution information for individuals. Our contributions are three-fold: we architect, prototype, and compare multiple hardware devices and software applications for collecting urban air pollution data with high spatial density in real-time; we develop web-based tools and mobile apps for the visualization and estimation of air pollution exposure customized to individuals; and we conduct field trials to validate our system and demonstrate that it yields much more accurate exposure estimates than current systems.

The inclusion of a proof mass near the free end of a micro-cantilever can significantly enhances the power responsiveness of a vibration energy harvester per unit acceleration. However, the accommodation of the proof mass comes at the expense of the active piezoelectric area. This paper numerically and experimentally investigates this compromise, and explores the optimal proof-mass-to-cantilever-length ratio for power maximization. It was found that an end mass occupying about 60%-70% of the total cantilever length is optimal within linear response, and they notably outperform comparable cantilevers with 40% and 50% of end mass. In addition, nonlinear squeeze film air damping within the chip package was found to adversely affect the cantilevers with larger mass more significantly. A harvester prototype with 70% of the length covered by end mass (5 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) was able to generate 1.78 \u03bcW at 0.6 ms\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n and up to 20.5 \u03bcW at 2.7 ms\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n and 210 Hz when not limited by nonlinear damping.

four-port multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system is designed using concentric square-ring patch antennas. All four ports are made to resonate at 2.4 GHz ISM band with an overall system dimension of 60\u00d760\u00d71.6 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. This design uses complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) loaded on its ground plane for enhanced isolation of - 22 dB between patch antenna elements. CSRR reduces mutual coupling by about 6.5 dB. The antenna operates with a 2:1 VSWR bandwidth of 75 MHz centered at 2.45 GHz. This collocated antenna system satisfies MIMO diversity performance with low envelope correlation between its waveforms. The effectiveness of concentric rings in MIMO design along with proposed isolation enhancement technique is validated using measurements from a prototype.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2499322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07323817.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2499322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Four-Port MIMO Antenna Using Concentric Square-Ring Patches Loaded With CSRR for High Isolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Four-Port MIMO Antenna Using Concentric Square-Ring Patches Loaded With CSRR for High Isolation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15898760","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7323817/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006143","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Government of India and University Grants Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Four-Port MIMO Antenna Using Concentric Square-Ring Patches Loaded With CSRR for High Isolation","sourcePdf":"lawp-kesavath-2499322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043425S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7323817","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323826,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7422174/7323826/7323826-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianming Liu (S\u201914) received his B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2005, and M.S. in electrical and communication engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009.

Recently, physical-layer network coding (PNC) using the binary CPFSK is considered as a potentially attractive solution to the dual needs of high throughput and high power efficiency in two-way relay wireless network. However, most recent studies on PNC have assumed that the carrier phases of the two transmitted signals arriving at the relay are ideally aligned. In fact, the carrier phase offset between the two node-signals always exists in practice. In this letter, a noncoherent multiple-symbol detector of binary CPFSK signals with unknown carrier phase offset in physical-layer network coding is proposed, which is based on the log-likelihood ratio test. It is shown by simulation that the algorithm with five symbol observation interval achieves 6.7 dB performance gain, compared with only one symbol observation interval.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07323830.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent Multiple-Symbol Detector of Binary CPFSK in Physical-Layer Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Relays","Bit error rate","Network coding","Artificial neural networks","Frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary CPFSK","noncoherent multiple-symbol detector","physical-layer network coding","binary continuous phase frequency shift keying signal","PNC","two-way relay wireless network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer network coding (PNC)","continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK)","noncoherent multiple symbol detector","carrier-phase offset"]},{"kwd":["Physical-layer network coding (PNC)","continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK)","noncoherent multiple-symbol detector","carrier-phase offset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent Multiple-Symbol Detector of Binary CPFSK in Physical-Layer Network Coding","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7323830/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697195","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"NS2014038"},{"fundingName":"Fundation of Graduate Innovation Center in NUAA","grantNumber":"kfjj20150404"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Funds of China","grantNumber":"61172078 and 61201208"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent Multiple-Symbol Detector of Binary CPFSK in Physical-Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"lcomm-dang-2499249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046623S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7374754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7374754","articleId":"7323830","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323831,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Luo","affiliation":["Network Communications and Economics Lab (NCEL), Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/7419943/7323831/yuluo-2499198-small.gif","p":["Yuan Luo (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, and the M.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

We propose a contract-theoretic framework for the database's spectrum reservation under demand stochasticity and information asymmetry. In such a framework, the database offers a set of contract items in the form of reservation amount and the corresponding payment, and each WSD chooses the best contract item based on its private information. We systematically study the optimal reservation contract design (that maximizes the database's expected profit) under two different risk-bearing schemes: DB-bearing-risk and WSD-bearing-risk, depending on who (the database or the WSDs) will bear the risk of over reservation. Counter-intuitively, we show that the optimal contract under DB-bearing-risk leads to a higher profit for the database and a higher total network profit. Our numerical results show that the proposed optimal spectrum reservation contract improves the total network profit up to 5%, compared with the scheme without information sharing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323831/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15835977","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Reservation Contract Design in TV White Space Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Funds","grantNumber":"CUHK 412713 and 14202814"},{"fundingName":"University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"},{"fundingName":"IEEE GLOBECOM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Reservation Contract Design in TV White Space Networks","sourcePdf":"tccn-huang-2499198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087592S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7419943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7419943","articleId":"7323831","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7323836,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Ali Sharifi","affiliation":["WiLab, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas Ali","lastName":"Sharifi","id":"37085495368"},{"name":"Mir Javad Musevi Niya","affiliation":["WiLab, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mir Javad","lastName":"Musevi Niya","id":"37085493890"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7323836","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Collaboration","Cascading style sheets","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes risk","global decision making process","fusion center","incorrect local sensing results","collaborative spectrum sensing reliability","attack-aware collaborative spectrum sensing approach","SSDF attack","spectrum sensing data falsification attack","cognitive radio networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attack-Aware","Attack Strength","Bayes Risk","Spectrum Sensing"]},{"kwd":["Attack-aware","attack strength","Bayes risk","spectrum sensing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07323836.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defense Against SSDF Attack in Cognitive Radio Networks: Attack-Aware Collaborative Spectrum Sensing Approach","abstract":"The reliability of the collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) can be severely decreased by spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks.

The effect of this error is examined in terms of the user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and capacity. Results reveal the relationship between the user SINR and RC errors as well as the number of antennas and users. Moreover, the findings show that the colocated antenna array is less sensitive to calibration errors than the case of distributed antennas even if the calibration signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is identical. The interference resulting from imperfect calibration becomes the determinant that constrains the performance, particularly when a high user SNR is required.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07323838.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2499283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of TDD Reciprocity Calibration for Massive MU-MIMO Systems With ZF Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323838/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of TDD Reciprocity Calibration for Massive MU-MIMO Systems With ZF Beamforming","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323838/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61271164, 61531009 and 61471108"},{"fundingName":"National major projects","grantNumber":"2014ZX03003001-002"},{"fundingName":"863 Project","grantNumber":"2015AA01A701"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education and China Mobile Research Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of TDD Reciprocity Calibration for Massive MU-MIMO Systems With ZF Beamforming","sourcePdf":"lcomm-shao-2499283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7374754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7374754","articleId":"7323838","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323840,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Jiang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085639776"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085360215"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7323840","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Optical noise","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio","Optical receivers","Wireless communication","Visible light communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel capacity","free-space optical communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communication","channel capacity","optical wireless channel","Shannon channel capacity","sphere packing argument method","sphere-packing upper bound","approximation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication","optical wireless channel","channel capacity","upper bound","sphere packing argument"]},{"kwd":["Visible light communication","optical wireless channel","channel capacity","upper bound","sphere packing argument"]}],"abstract":"Since the optical wireless channel in visible light communication (VLC) systems is subject to the non-negativity of the signal and the average optical power, the classic Shannon channel capacity formula is not applicable to VLC systems. To derive a simple closed-form upper bound on channel capacity, sphere packing argument method has been applied previously. However, there is an obvious gap between the existing sphere-packing upper bounds and the lower bounds at high optical signal-to-noise-ratios (OSNRs), which is mainly caused by the inaccurate mathematical approximation of the intrinsic volumes of the simplex. In this letter, a tight sphere-packing upper bound is derived with a new approximation method.

It is well known that standard algorithms for matrix completion can return arbitrarily poor results, if even a single column is corrupted. One direct application comes from robust collaborative filtering. Here, some number of users are so-called manipulators who try to skew the predictions of the algorithm by calibrating their inputs to the system. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm for this problem based on a combination of a trimming procedure and a convex program that minimizes the nuclear norm and the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1,2</sub>\n norm. Our theoretical results show that given a vanishing fraction of observed entries, it is nevertheless possible to complete the underlying matrix even when the number of corrupted columns grows. Significantly, our results hold without any assumptions on the locations or values of the observed entries of the manipulated columns. Moreover, we show by an information-theoretic argument that our guarantees are nearly optimal in terms of the fraction of sampled entries on the authentic columns, the fraction of corrupted columns, and the rank of the underlying matrix. Our results therefore sharply characterize the tradeoffs between sample, robustness, and rank in matrix completion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7323850/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669091","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Matrix Completion With Column Manipulation: Near-Optimal Sample-Robustness-Rank Tradeoffs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF-31712-23800"},{"fundingName":"Office of Naval Research through Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0688"},{"fundingName":"School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell University"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of Singapore through the AcRF Tier Two Project","grantNumber":"R-265-000-443-112 and R265-000-519-112"},{"fundingName":"Agency for Science Technology and Research within the Science and Engineering Research Council through the Public Sector Research Funding","grantNumber":"R-265-000-540-305"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1056028, 1302435 and 1116955"},{"fundingName":"U.S. DoT through the Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning Tier 1 University Transportation Center"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"0954059 and 1302435"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix Completion With Column Manipulation: Near-Optimal Sample-Robustness-Rank Tradeoffs","sourcePdf":"tit-chen-2499247-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159138S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7360961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7360961","articleId":"7323850","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7323851,"authors":[{"name":"Panbao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7440769/7323851/wang-small.gif","p":["Panbao Wang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201911) received the M.S. degree in\n electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include dc microgrid system model analysis, operation and control, power electronics\n converters for hybrid storage system, and optimal control for power management in microgrid system, etc."]},"firstName":"Panbao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38467837100"},{"name":"Xiaonan Lu","affiliation":["Energy Systems Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7440769/7323851/lu-small.gif","p":["Xiaonan Lu (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) was born in Tianjin, China,\n in 1985.

The proposed secondary control scheme can remove the dc voltage deviation and improve the current sharing accuracy by using voltage-shifting and slope-adjusting approaches simultaneously. Meanwhile, the average value of droop coefficients is calculated, and then it is controlled by an additional controller included in the distributed secondary control layer to ensure that each droop coefficient converges at a reasonable value. Hence, by adjusting the droop coefficient, each participating converter has equal output impedance, and the accurate proportional load current sharing can be achieved with different line resistances. Furthermore, the current sharing performance in steady and transient states can be enhanced by using the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by detailed experimental tests based on a 3 \u00d7 1 kW prototype with three interface converters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","volume":"31","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15874590","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7323851/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Distributed Secondary Control Method for DC Microgrids With Enhanced Dynamic Current Sharing Performance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51477033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Distributed Secondary Control Method for DC Microgrids With Enhanced Dynamic Current Sharing Performance","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2499310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188534S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7440769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"7440769","articleId":"7323851","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7323852,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7323852/chu-2499439-small.gif","p":["Zheng Chu received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou, China, in 2007; the M.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2011; and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communications and signal processing from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 2012,  where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include physical-layer security, wireless cooperative networks, wireless power transfer, convex optimization techniques, and game theory."]},"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085347034"},{"name":"Zhengyu Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7323852/zhu-2499439-small.gif","p":["Zhengyu Zhu (S'14) received the B.S. degree from Henan University, Kaifeng, China, in 2010.

First, transmit beamforming without artificial noise (AN) is designed to achieve the secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the transmit power and the energy harvesting (EH) constraints. This problem is not convex, but this can be solved by applying a bisection search to a sequence of the associated power minimization problems, each of which can be solved by using a novel relaxation approach. Moreover, we extend our proposed algorithms to the robust case by incorporating channel uncertainties. Then, transmit beamforming with AN is investigated for the secrecy rate maximization problem, where two relaxation approaches are presented, i.e., a two-level optimization algorithm and a successive convex approximation (SCA), to solve the secrecy rate maximization problem. In addition, tightness analyses of rank relaxation are provided to show that the optimal transmit covariance matrix exactly returns rank one. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07323852.pdf","startPage":"6913","endPage":"6925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2499439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2499439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Wireless Information Power Transfer for MISO Secrecy Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Receivers","Optimization","Minimization","Robustness","Transmitters","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","covariance matrices","energy harvesting","radiofrequency power transmission","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous wireless information power transfer","SWIPT","multiple input single output secrecy channel","MISO secrecy channel","transmit beamforming","artificial noise","secrecy rate maximization problem","energy harvesting","power minimization problems","optimization algorithm","successive convex approximation","SCA","tightness analyses","rank relaxation","covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bisection method","multiple-input\u2013single-output (MISO) system","physical-layer secrecy","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","successive convex approximation (SCA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Wireless Information Power Transfer for MISO Secrecy Channel","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7323852/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306016","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Wireless Information Power Transfer for MISO Secrecy Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-chu-2499439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126924S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7323852","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323859,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7355262/7323859/wewei-2494010-small.gif","p":["\n               Wei Wei received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

D-RERD aims at minimizing the total expected production cost in the worst renewable power distribution. In this way, D-RERD inherits the advantages from both stochastic optimization and robust optimization: statistical characteristic is taken into account in a data-driven manner without requiring the exact pdf of uncertain factors. We present a convex optimization-based algorithm to solve the D-RERD, which involves solving semidefinite programming (SDP), convex quadratic programming (CQP), and linear programming (LP). The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the emerging adaptive robust optimization (ARO)-based model on the IEEE 118-bus system.

Chronic seizures were induced by intraperitoneal kainic acid injection. Two bipolar electrodes were implanted into the CA1 regions of both hippocampi. The electrodes were connected to the custom-built programmable therapeutic neurostimulation device that can trigger an electrical stimulation either in a periodic manner or upon detection of the intracerebral electroencephalographic (icEEE) seizure onset. This device includes a microchip consisting of a 256-channel icEEG recording system and a 64-channel stimulator, and a programmable seizure detector implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The neurostimulator was used to evaluate seizure suppression efficacy in ten epileptic rats for a total of 240 subject-days (5760 subject-hours). For this purpose, all rats were randomly divided into two groups: the no-stimulation group and the stimulation group. The no-stimulation group did not receive stimulation. The stimulation group received, first, closed-loop stimulation and, next, open-loop stimulation. The no-stimulation and stimulation groups had a similar seizure frequency baseline, averaging five seizures per day. Closed-loop stimulation reduced seizure frequency by 90% and open-loop stimulation reduced seizure frequency by 17%, both in the stimulation group as compared to the no-stimulation group.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/7491402/07323863.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2498973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2498973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7491402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seizure Suppression Efficacy of Closed-Loop Versus Open-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation in a Rodent Model of Epilepsy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rats","Epilepsy","Electrodes","Hippocampus","Electroencephalography","Electrical stimulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","electroencephalography","field programmable gate arrays","medical disorders","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seizure suppression efficacy","closed-loop deep brain stimulation","open-loop deep brain stimulation","open-loop neurostimulation","closed-loop neurostimulation","rat hippocampus","low-power programmable therapeutic neurostimulation device","epilepsy rodent model","chronic seizures","bipolar electrodes","intraperitoneal kainic acid injection","custom-built programmable therapeutic neurostimulation device","electrical stimulation","intracerebral electroencephalographic seizure onset detection","icEEG recording system","field-programmable gate array","epileptic rats","seizure frequency baseline","CA1 regions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closed-loop neurostimulation","CMOS","deep brain stimulation (DBS)","electroencephalograph (EEG)","epilepsy","epilepsy model","hippocampus","ictal","intracerebral electroencephalograph (icEEE)","integrated circuit","integrated neural interfaces","neural monitoring","neural recording","neurostimulator","open-loop neurostimulation","rat","responsive neurostimulation","rodent","seizure","seizure detection","very large scale integration (VLSI)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Deep Brain Stimulation","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electroencephalography","Epilepsy","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Feedback","Male","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Treatment Outcome"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Seizure Suppression Efficacy of Closed-Loop Versus Open-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation in a Rodent Model of Epilepsy","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7323863/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16073299","pubMedId":"26571534","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seizure Suppression Efficacy of Closed-Loop Versus Open-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation in a Rodent Model of Epilepsy","sourcePdf":"tnsre-salam-2498973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113513S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7491402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7491402","articleId":"7323863","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323868,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongguan Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7361791/7323868/wang-2493638-small.gif","p":["Zhongguan Wang (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014.

Control signals updated with latest local measurements are executed in each iteration step to speed up the frequency recovery procedure. In the second stage, an average consensus algorithm is applied to resolve frequency oscillations caused by measurement errors.

Every effort was made to predict LEP error rates that are conservatively high; even secondary protons generated in the spacecraft shielding have been included in the analysis. Across all the environments and circuits investigated, and when operating within 10% of the nominal operating voltage, LEPs were found to increase the total SEU rate to up to 4.3 times as high as it would have been in the absence of LEPs. Therefore, the best approach to account for LEP effects may be to calculate the total error rate from high-energy protons and heavy ions, and then multiply it by a safety margin of 5. If that error rate can be tolerated then our findings suggest that it is justified to waive LEP tests in certain situations. Trends were observed in the LEP angular responses of the circuits tested. Grazing angles were the worst case for the SOI circuits, whereas the worst-case angle was at or near normal incidence for the bulk circuits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Contribution of Low-Energy Protons to the Total On-Orbit SEU Rate","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2486763","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7348735/07323869.pdf","startPage":"2440","endPage":"2451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2486763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7348735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"The Contribution of Low-Energy Protons to the Total On-Orbit SEU Rate","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7323869/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TRIUMF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006234","fundingName":"Sandia National Laboratories"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Contribution of Low-Energy Protons to the Total On-Orbit SEU Rate","sourcePdf":"tns-dodds-2486763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.251815S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7348735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7348735","articleId":"7323869","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7323872,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This structure provides sufficient power gain along with high linearity and efficiency in comparison to other topologies. This is shown to be due to the low dependency of the power gain to the transistor transconductance and the smaller voltage variations across the gate-source capacitance.

In LTE-Advanced systems, the turbo codes are highly punctured to achieve high data rate when the channel is reliable. In that case, since only a small part of the input frame memory contains meaningful data, accessing all entries of the memory is redundant. To reduce the meaningless accesses, the proposed reverse rate matching method evaluates whether each code bit is punctured or not. As a result, more than 30% of the power consumed in accessing the input memory can be saved when the code rate is high. Furthermore, a low-complexity hardware architecture realizing the proposed method is presented for parallel-SISO decoding. By making use of a specific relationship resident in parallel input indexes, the hardware complexity of the reverse rate matching unit is reduced by 44%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Long Term Evolution","Indexes","Iterative closest point algorithm","Turbo codes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","Long Term Evolution","power consumption","telecommunication power management","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse rate matching method","LTE-Advanced turbo decoders","input frame memory","code bit","code rate","low-complexity hardware architecture","parallel-SISO decoding","parallel input indexes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power","LTE-Advanced","parallel SISO decoding","rate matching","turbo decoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2495722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7347494/07323875.pdf","startPage":"2920","endPage":"2928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7347494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2495722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse Rate Matching for Low-Power LTE-Advanced Turbo Decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7323875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reverse Rate Matching for Low-Power LTE-Advanced Turbo Decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323875/","volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323875/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15661112","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse Rate Matching for Low-Power LTE-Advanced Turbo Decoders","sourcePdf":"tcsi-park-2495722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061904S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7347494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7347494","articleId":"7323875","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7323876,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Kun Wei","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Kun","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0001-9917-6492","id":"37085712228"},{"name":"Wei Shao","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shao","id":"37280513300"},{"name":"Sheng-Bing Shi","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Sheng-Bing","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085701340"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280506100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7323876","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Finite difference methods","Polynomials","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","numerical analysis","polynomials","sparse matrices","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D WLP FDTD method","vertex based domain decomposition scheme","finite difference time domain","weighted Laguerre polynomials","2D transversal electric","vertex based partitioning scheme","magnetic field","sparse matrix equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain decomposition","Laguerre polynomials","Schur complement system","vertex-based partitioning"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an efficient vertex-based domain decomposition technique is introduced into the unconditionally stable finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method based on weighted Laguerre polynomials (WLPs).

This work presents an RF-input/RF-output outphasing power amplifier that directly amplifies a modulated RF input, eliminating the need for multiple costly IQ modulators and baseband signal component separation as in previous outphasing systems. An RF signal decomposition network directly synthesizes the phase- and amplitude-modulated signals used to drive the branch power amplifiers (PAs). With this approach, a modulated RF signal including zero-crossings can be applied to the single RF input port of the outphasing RF amplifier system. The proposed technique is demonstrated at 2.14 GHz in a four-way lossless outphasing amplifier with transmission-line power combiner. The RF decomposition network is implemented using a transmission-line resistance compression network with nonlinear loads designed to provide the necessary amplitude and phase decomposition. The resulting proof-of-concept outphasing power amplifier has a peak CW output power of 93 W, peak drain efficiency of 70%, and performance on par with a previously-demonstrated outphasing and power combining system requiring four IQ modulators and a digital signal component separator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7323877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","volume":"63","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15635472","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7323877/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theory and Implementation of RF-Input <newline/>Outphasing Power Amplification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and Implementation of RF-Input <newline/>Outphasing Power Amplification","sourcePdf":"tmtt-barton-2495358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069608S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7343796","articleId":"7323877","onlineDate":"10 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7324051,"authors":[{"name":"Peer Neubert","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Peer","lastName":"Neubert","id":"37600009900"},{"name":"Peter Protzel","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Protzel","id":"37330206000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9163-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9162-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324051","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":517},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local region detector + CNN based landmarks for practical place recognition in changing environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7320493/7324045/07324051.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMR.2015.7324051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324045","doi":"10.1109/ECMR.2015.7324051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Image recognition","Proposals","Image matching","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","image matching","image segmentation","image sequences","mobile robots","neural nets","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local region detector","CNN based landmarks","visual place recognition","mobile robotics","image matching","holistic descriptors","image sequences","convolutional neural network","image segmentation","object proposals","SIFT keypoint detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324051","abstract":"Visual place recognition is a mature field in mobile robotics research. Recognizing places in datasets covering traversals of hundreds or thousands of kilometres and accurate localization in small and medium size environments have been successfully demonstrated. However, for real world long term operation, visual place recognition has to face severe environmental appearance changes due to day-night cycles, seasonal or weather changes. Existing approaches for recognizing places in such changing environments provide solutions for matching images from the exact same viewpoint using powerful holistic descriptors, using less sophisticated holistic descriptors in combinations with images sequences, and/or pose strong requirements on training data to learn systematic appearance changes. In this paper, we present a novel, training free, single image matching procedure that builds upon local region detectors for powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based descriptors. It can be used with a broad range of local region detectors including keypoints, segmentation based approaches and object proposals. We propose a novel evaluation criterion for selection of an appropriate local region detector for changing environments and compare several available detectors. The scale space extrema detector known from the SIFT keypoint detector in combination with appropriate magnification factors performs best. We present preliminary results of the proposed image matching procedure with several region detectors on the challenging Nordland dataset on place recognition between different seasons and a dataset including severe viewpoint changes. The proposed method outperforms the best existing holistic method for place recognition in such changing environments and can additionally handle severe viewpoint changes. Additionally, the combination of the best performing detectors with superpixel based spatial image support shows promising results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589647","htmlLink":"/document/7324051/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Local region detector + CNN based landmarks for practical place recognition in changing environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local region detector + CNN based landmarks for practical place recognition in changing environments","confLoc":"Lincoln, UK","sourcePdf":"LocalRegionDetectorCNNba.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069914S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7320493","isNumber":"7324045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7320493","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7324045","articleId":"7324051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324070,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["GGITM - Bhopal, NIIST - Bhopal, NIIST, Bhopal"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085669613"},{"name":"Prem Nath Suman","affiliation":["GGITM - Bhopal, NIIST - Bhopal, NIIST, Bhopal"],"firstName":"Prem Nath","lastName":"Suman","id":"37085505007"},{"name":"Akhilesh Jain","affiliation":["GGITM - Bhopal, NIIST - Bhopal, NIIST, Bhopal"],"firstName":"Akhilesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085514075"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6437-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324070","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Energy efficiency","Uplink","Power demand","Base stations","Interference","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","femtocellular radio","indoor radio","power consumption","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency improvement","femtocell network","downlink throughput estimation","uplink power estimation","mobile device","base station","indoor home","office users","femtocell access point","resource utilization","cell selection scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","cell selection","uplink transmission","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"With ever increasing number of mobile devices, operators have to search for new alternative to handle user demands. Deployment of additional base stations is always an option to improve coverage of capacity. However, it comes with the cost of increased operational and capital expenditure. Interestingly, it has been seen that nearly 80% of mobile data demands are originating from indoor home and office users. To handle these indoor demands, deployment of small, low power femtocell access points have been suggested. However, in current deployment scenario, most femtocell are underutilized. To improve user association and resource utilization in femtocell, various cell selection schemes have been suggested. However, most cell selection schemes fail to analyze end users power consumption in association criteria. In this paper, we suggest a cell selection scheme to incorporate both uplink power and downlink bitrate to make association decision. Our scheme shows improvement in both capacity and energy efficiency of the network. Obtained results are verified using extensive simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving energy efficiency of femtocell network by joint estimation of downlink throughput and uplink power","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324070","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311166/7324014/07324070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving energy efficiency of femtocell network by joint estimation of downlink throughput and uplink power","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324070/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589289","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving energy efficiency of femtocell network by joint estimation of downlink throughput and uplink power","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"sno25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060755S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311166","isNumber":"7324014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311166","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7324014","articleId":"7324070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324072,"authors":[{"name":"Dheeraj Gupta","affiliation":["NIT Hamirpur, NIIST-Bhopal, BITT-Getlatu, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, INDIA"],"firstName":"Dheeraj","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085635939"},{"name":"Akhilesh Jain","affiliation":["NIT Hamirpur, NIIST-Bhopal, BITT-Getlatu, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, INDIA"],"firstName":"Akhilesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085514075"},{"name":"Prem Nath Suman","affiliation":["NIT Hamirpur, NIIST-Bhopal, BITT-Getlatu, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, INDIA"],"firstName":"Prem Nath","lastName":"Suman","id":"37085505007"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6437-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324072","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Channel allocation","Protocols","Heuristic algorithms","Cognitive radio","Interference","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","interference suppression","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","radio spectrum allocation","optimum transmission power allocation","interference avoidance","primary receiver","channel utilization","PROPELLer","proactive power estimation for low latency","dynamic channel allocation mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Spectrum allocation","Power Control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324072","doi":"10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324072","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","abstract":"Cognitive Radio is an emerging field of research that has the potential to cause a global transformation in the present day radio technology. The present day radio spectrum is allocated and divided between licensed and unlicensed frequencies. This policy being rigid has resulted in some frequency bands growing in scarcity and leaving a large portion of the radio spectrum still unused. Cognitive Radio provides a flexible and efficient mechanism for use of the entire radio spectrum. This framework allows wireless devices without dedicated frequency and power allocation (Secondary Users) to intelligently access portions of the entire radio spectrum without interfering the licensed users (Primary Users). This paper presents four integrated techniques for optimum allocation of transmission power and spectrum to a secondary user with an aim to avoid interference to silent primary receivers of the frequencies being reused by the cognitive network and increase coexistence. Two power allocation algorithms viz. Location Aware Power Allocation and Fixed Power Feasibility Check Allocation and two channel allocation algorithms viz. Master Slave Channel Allocation and Distributed Channel Allocation have been implemented and compared for their interference to primary receivers, channel utilization, average number of back offs and delay in transmission. Finally, a dynamic power allocation framework, PROPELLer (Proactive Power Estimation for Low Latency) implementing the same algorithms along with a dynamic channel allocation mechanism has been proposed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324014","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311166/7324014/07324072.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proactive power estimation for Low Latency in cognitive radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324072/","displayDocTitle":"A proactive power estimation for Low Latency in cognitive radio network","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589299","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proactive power estimation for Low Latency in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"sno27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047198S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311166","isNumber":"7324014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311166","xplore-issue":"7324014","articleId":"7324072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324073,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A host of channel coding techniques has been proposed to alleviate the effect of such noise and interference. Among these Turbo codes are recommended, because of increased capacity at higher transmission rates and superior performance over convolutional codes. The multimedia elements which are associated with ample amount of data are best protected by Turbo codes. Turbo decoder employs Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) and Soft Output Viterbi Decoding (SOVA) algorithms. Conventional Turbo coded systems employ Equal Error Protection (EEP) in which the protection of all the data in an information message is uniform. Some applications involve Unequal Error Protection (UEP) in which the level of protection is higher for important information bits than that of other bits. In this work, enhancement to the traditional Log MAP decoding algorithm is being done by using optimized scaling factors for both the decoders. The error correcting performance in presence of UEP in Additive White Gaussian Noise channel (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading are analyzed for the transmission of image with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as source coding technique. This paper compares the performance of log MAP, Modified log MAP (MlogMAP) and Enhanced log MAP (ElogMAP) algorithms used for image transmission.

The performance comparison of AWGN with fading channel indicates the robustness of the proposed algorithm. According to the performance of three different message classes, class3 would be more protected than other two classes. From the performance analysis, it is observed that ElogMAP algorithm with UEP is best for transmission of an image compared to Log MAP and MlogMAP decoding algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324106","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311166/7324014/07324106.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined source and channel coding for image transmission using enhanced turbo codes in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combined source and channel coding for image transmission using enhanced turbo codes in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15589278","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324106/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324106/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined source and channel coding for image transmission using enhanced turbo codes in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"sno58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061547S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311166","isNumber":"7324014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311166","xplore-issue":"7324014","articleId":"7324106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7324108,"authors":[{"name":"Amol C.

Thus, it is impossible to operate the CMOS based 6-Transistor (6T) SRAM cell bellow 600 mV. Hence, a CNFET based 8T SRAM cell is suggested in this article to alleviate the effect of process fluctuations. Different design metrics of an SRAM cell are accessed for the proposed cell and to show its effectiveness, the design metrics are compared with its conventional counterpart. The proposed cell dissipates less dynamic power (1.2\u00d7 read power and 1.02\u00d7 write power) and also consumes 16.17\u00d7 less power when it is not accessed @ 200 mV compared to conventional CMOS based 8T cell. It depicts its robustness against process fluctuations by showing narrower spread in read power (97.91%), write power (96.35%), and hold power consumption (87.34%) for the same supply voltage.

Considering sparse signal feature, two novel compressed sensing schemes are proposed, which can reduce compressed sampling rate in contrast to the traditional scheme. One algorithm is dynamically adjusting compression ratio based on modulation recognition and identification of symbol rate, which can reduce compression ratio. Furthermore, without priori information of the modulation and symbol rate, another improved algorithm is proposed with the application potential in practice, which does not need to reconstruct the signals. The improved algorithm is divided into two stages, which are the approaching stage and the monitoring stage. The overall sampling rate can be dramatically reduced without the performance deterioration of the spectrum detection compared to the conventional static compressed sampling rate algorithm. Numerous results show that the proposed compressed sensing technique can reduce sampling rate by 35%, with an acceptable detection probability over 0.9.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2015.000090","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/7324143/07324151.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2015.000090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel schemes to optimize sampling rate for compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324151/","displayDocTitle":"Novel schemes to optimize sampling rate for compressed sensing","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587193","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel schemes to optimize sampling rate for compressed sensing","sourcePdf":"517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044865S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","isNumber":"7324143","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7324151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324174,"authors":[{"name":"Alejo Concha","affiliation":["I3A, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejo","lastName":"Concha","id":"37085494010"},{"name":"Javier Civera","affiliation":["I3A, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Civera","id":"37579561700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9163-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9162-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324174","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324174","abstract":"The so-called direct SLAM methods have shown an impressive performance in estimating a dense 3D reconstruction from RGB sequences in real-time [1], [2], [3].

It uses predicted human trajectories and a social cost function to plan collision-free paths that take human comfort into account. It furthermore employs time dependent, kinodynamic path planning to reason about human motion over time and to account for the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a robot. Our approach generates paths that exhibit properties similar to those used in human-human interaction, such as waiting for a human to pass before continuing along an intended path, avoiding getting too close to another human's personal space, and moving out of the way when blocking a human's path. In extensive experiments carried out with real robots and in simulation we demonstrate the performance of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/ECMR.2015.7324184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMR.2015.7324184","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7320493/7324045/07324184.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time dependent planning on a layered social cost map for human-aware robot navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Time dependent planning on a layered social cost map for human-aware robot navigation","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324184/","accessionNumber":"15589659","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324184/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time dependent planning on a layered social cost map for human-aware robot navigation","confLoc":"Lincoln, UK","sourcePdf":"TimeDependentPlanningonaL.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046132S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7320493","isNumber":"7324045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7320493","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7324045","articleId":"7324184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7324211,"authors":[{"name":"Gurshaant Singh Malik","firstName":"Gurshaant Singh","lastName":"Malik"},{"name":"Krishna Gupta","affiliation":["709th Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, Wuhan, P.

In the past few years, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been widely used to analyze epileptic EEG. However, one practical question unanswered is the optimal levels of wavelet decomposition. Deeper DWT can yield a more detailed depiction of signals but it requires substantially more computational time. In this paper, we study this problem, using the most difficult epileptic EEG classification task, focus localization, as an example. The results show that decomposition level effects the localization accuracy more significantly than mother wavelets. For all wavelets, decomposition beyond level 7 improves accuracy limitedly and even decreases accuracy. We further study what are the most effective bands and features for focus localization. An interpretation of our results is that focal and non-focal epileptic EEGs differ the most at high frequencies of EEG rhythms. The best accuracy of epileptic focus localization achieved in this research is 83.07% using sym6 from levels 1 to 7.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epileptic focus localization using EEG based on discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324317","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311793/7324166/07324317.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Epileptic focus localization using EEG based on discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324317/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615286","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epileptic focus localization using EEG based on discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"final104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090004S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311793","isNumber":"7324166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311793","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7324166","articleId":"7324317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324320,"authors":[{"name":"Huseyin Ozkan","affiliation":["Bilkent University, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Ozkan","id":"38244550300"},{"name":"Fatih Ozkan","affiliation":["Information Systems, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Ozkan","id":"38243440500"},{"name":"Ibrahim Delibalta","affiliation":["Avea Labs, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Delibalta","id":"37085495599"},{"name":"Suleyman S.

The analog PPG is transformed into a sequence of time events where the time between two events represents a constant area under the analog PPG signal, with injective mapping between the two domains. A simple and robust method is formulated that directly estimates the systolic peak time from the output of the IF sampler. The proposed processing method can be implemented in hardware using simple combinatorial logic and is comparable to performance of existing digital signal processing methods in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324322","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311793/7324166/07324322.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse based signal processing for systolic peak recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324322/","displayDocTitle":"Pulse based signal processing for systolic peak recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589613","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324322/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse based signal processing for systolic peak recognition","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"final117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061183S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311793","isNumber":"7324166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311793","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7324166","articleId":"7324322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324324,"authors":[{"name":"Mengqi Ji","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Mengqi","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085703370"},{"name":"Lu Fang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37532747600"},{"name":"Haitian Zheng","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Haitian","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085705216"},{"name":"Matti Strese","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Strese","id":"37085394600"},{"name":"Eckehard Steinbach","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Eckehard","lastName":"Steinbach","id":"37273225600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7454-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"7324324","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Acceleration","Feature extraction","Kernel","Haptic interfaces","Training","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration","acoustic convolution","audio coding","convergence","haptic interfaces","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preprocessing-free surface material classification","pretrained convolutional neural networks","sparse autoencoder","acceleration signals","rigid tool","object surface","automatic feature learning","RAW acceleration data","convergence","trained sparse autoencoder weights","weight initialization","convolution layers","sparse AE","ACNN","publicly available haptic texture database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["haptic texture classification","convolutional neural networks","CNN pretraining","sparse Autoencoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324324","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311793/7324166/07324324.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preprocessing-free surface material classification using convolutional neural networks pretrained by sparse Autoencoder","abstract":"Acceleration signals captured during the interaction of a rigid tool with an object surface carry relevant information for surface material classification.

Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify subsets of samples and subsets of features that jointly specify anomalous clusters. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect botnet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324326","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311793/7324166/07324326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting clusters of anomalies on low-dimensional feature subsets with application to network traffic flow data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324326/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting clusters of anomalies on low-dimensional feature subsets with application to network traffic flow data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589567","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324326/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting clusters of anomalies on low-dimensional feature subsets with application to network traffic flow data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"final122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057507S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311793","isNumber":"7324166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311793","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7324166","articleId":"7324326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324327,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Abbasnejad","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Abbasnejad","id":"38488648700"},{"name":"Damien Teney","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Teney","id":"38526368600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7454-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"7324327","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Three-dimensional displays","Face recognition","Databases","Solid modeling","Feature extraction","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","face recognition","image classification","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical Bayesian network","face recognition","2D facial data","3D facial data","face classification","face verification","face representation","2D salient facial regions","full 3D geometrical model","pose variations","unconstrained environments","FERET databases","LFW databases"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we tackle the problem of face classification and verification.

The approach combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a spiking neural network (SNN). The HMM, consisting of states and transitions, forms a fixed backbone with nonadaptive transition probabilities. The SNN, however, implements a Bayesian computation by using an appropriately selected spike timing dependency (STDP) learning rule. A separate SNN, each with the same architecture, is associated with each of the p states of the HMM. Because of the STDP tuning, each SNN implements an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the particular observation probabilities for one particular HMM state. When applied to an isolated spoken word (as a popular sequential data) recognition problem, the hybrid model performs well and efficiently with a desirable accuracy rate. Because of the model's uniqueness and initial success, it warrants further study. Future work intends to broaden its capabilities and improve the biological realism.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311793/7324166/07324350.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studying the interaction of a hidden Markov model with a Bayesian spiking neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Neurons","Speech","Training","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","Bayesian spiking neural network","sequential data classification","HMM","SNN","nonadaptive transition probabilities","spike timing dependency learning rule","STDP learning rule","expectation maximization algorithm","EM algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequential data","classification","spiking neural network","STDP","HMM","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Studying the interaction of a hidden Markov model with a Bayesian spiking neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324350/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589585","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studying the interaction of a hidden Markov model with a Bayesian spiking neural network","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"final29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054214S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311793","isNumber":"7324166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324166","articleId":"7324350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324392,"authors":[{"name":"Anwer Al-Dulaimi","affiliation":["ECE, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Anwer","lastName":"Al-Dulaimi","id":"38275112700"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["WINCORE Lab, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37085341604"},{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Oulu University, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bennis","id":"37299803500"},{"name":"Athanasios V.

The cloud radio access network (C- RAN) emerges as one of the 5G solutions to steer the network architecture and control resources beyond the legacy radio access technologies. The C-RAN decouples the traffic management operations from the radio access technologies leading to a new combination of virtualized network core and fronthaul architecture. In this paper, we first investigate the power consumption impact due to the aggressive deployments of low-power neighborhood femtocell networks (NFNs) under the umbrella of a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) macrocell. We show that power savings obtained from employing low power NFN start to decline as the density of deployed femtocells exceed certain threshold. The analysis considers two CoMP sites at the cell-edge and intra-cell areas. Second, to restore the power efficiency and network stabilization, a C-RAN model is proposed to restructure the NFN into clusters to ease the energy burden in the evolving 5G systems. Tailoring this to traffic load, selected clusters will be switched off to save power when they operate with low traffic loads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5G Green Communications: C-RAN Provisioning of CoMP and Femtocells for Power Management","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324392","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324392.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"5G Green Communications: C-RAN Provisioning of CoMP and Femtocells for Power Management","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324392/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601222","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G Green Communications: C-RAN Provisioning of CoMP and Femtocells for Power Management","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050354S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324393,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The performance of the algorithm depends on the quality of bounds for the subproblems which are determined within the branch-and-bound procedure. These subproblems can be generated by a successive fixing of beamforming components but turn out to be difficult nonconvex optimization problems. It is known that the introduction of an additional variable yields easier convex problems such that bounds can be determined efficiently. We use the concept of fractional programming to improve these bounds and show that this may provide a significant reduction of iterations and computational expense.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324395.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Discrete Receive Beamforming with Improved Bounds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324395/","displayDocTitle":"A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Discrete Receive Beamforming with Improved Bounds","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601251","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Discrete Receive Beamforming with Improved Bounds","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074627S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7324397,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Centenaro","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Centenaro","id":"37085568800"},{"name":"Giulio Ministeri","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Ministeri","id":"38520245900"},{"name":"Lorenzo Vangelista","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Veneto, IT"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Vangelista"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324397","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"abstract":"Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) techniques are largely used in the context of wireless communications systems especially in the last few years, being employed in the latest cellular systems, including the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard.

VANET QoS-OLSR is a clustering protocol that is able to increase the stability of the network while maintaining the QoS requirements. However, in this protocol, vehicles can misbehave either by under-speeding or over- speeding the road speed limits after clusters are formed. Such misbehavior leads to a widely disconnected network, which raises the need for a detection mechanism. The majority of the existing detection mechanisms are non-cooperative in the sense that they are based on unilateral judgments, which may be untrustworthy. Others employ cooperative detection scheme with evidence-based aggregation techniques such as the Dempster-Shafer (DS) which suffers from the (1) instability when observations come from dependent sources and (2) absence of learning mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose a cooperative method using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is able to (1) aggregate judgments and prevent the unilateral decisions, and (2) benefit from the previous detection experience by continuous learning. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection probability and reduces the false alarms rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324400","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband

Novel Pilot Expansion Approach for MIMO Channel Estimation and Tracking","abstract":"Enabling high practical mobility of MIMO-OFDM systems requires accurate channel estimation under severe frequency and time selective fading channels. Conventional methods rely on non-realistic approximations or result in impractical complexities. In this paper, a new practical training-based MIMO channel estimation scheme is presented. The new pilot bits designed from the 'Paley-Hadamard' matrix allows exploiting its orthogonal and 'Toeplitz-like' structures for minimising its pilot length. Additionally, a novel pilot expansion technique is proposed to estimate the length of the channel impulse response, by flexibly extending its pilot length as required to capture the number of multipath existed within the MIMO channel. The proposed pilot expansion enables to deduce the initial channel variation and its Doppler rate, which can be subsequently applied for MIMO channel tracking using decision feedback Kalman filter during the data payload.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324409/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601236","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324409/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Pilot Expansion Approach for MIMO Channel Estimation and Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Pilot Expansion Approach for MIMO Channel Estimation and Tracking","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0857S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7324414,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hu","affiliation":["CMC Microsystems, Kingston, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085761927"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324414","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","Delays","Servers","Security","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","software radio","ubiquitous computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system architecture","software-defined Industrial Internet of Things","low-level device operations","high-level data-centric application interactions","quality of service","QoS","WirelessHART","WebSocket","IETF constrained application protocol","CoAP","software-defined networking","SDN"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor networks have been a driving force of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) advancement in the process control and manufacturing industry. The emergence of IIoT opens great potential for the ubiquitous field device connectivity and manageability with an integrated and standardized architecture from low- level device operations to high-level data-centric application interactions. This technological development requires software definability in the key architectural elements of IIoT, including wireless field devices, IIoT gateways, network infrastructure, and IIoT sensor cloud services. In this paper, a novel software-defined IIoT (SD- IIoT) is proposed in order to solve essential challenges in a holistic IIoT system, such as reliability, security, timeliness scalability, and quality of service (QoS). A new IIoT system architecture is proposed based on the latest networking technologies such as WirelessHART, WebSocket, IETF constrained application protocol (CoAP) and software-defined networking (SDN). A new scheme based on CoAP and SDN is proposed to solve the QoS issues. Computer experiments in a case study are implemented to show the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324414","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System Architecture for Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324414/","displayDocTitle":"A System Architecture for Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601245","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324414/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System Architecture for Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1168014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035926S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7324419,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["Paris-Saclay University Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2), UMR-8506) CNRS - CentraleSupelec - University Paris-Sud XI 3 rue Joliot-Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085427981"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Paris-Saclay University Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2), UMR-8506) CNRS - CentraleSupelec - University Paris-Sud XI 3 rue Joliot-Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324419","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Mathematical model","Stochastic processes","Geometry","Monte Carlo methods","Approximation methods","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Monte Carlo methods","radiofrequency interference","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic geometry modeling","stochastic geometry analysis","mmWave cellular network","stochastic geometry abstraction modeling","base station location","channel model","millimeter wave cellular network","noise-limited approximation","ultra-dense network deployment","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"By relying on a stochastic geometry abstraction modeling for the locations of the base stations and by considering an accurate channel model based on measurements, the author of [1] has recently proposed a tractable mathematical framework for evaluating coverage and rate of millimeter wave cellular networks.

Unlike standard estimation techniques, the proposed method improves the system performance by appropriately embedding the direction finding and receive beamforming tasks within the turbo iteration loop. In fact, the DOA estimates and the soft information are iteratively exchanged between the decoding and estimation blocks, respectively, according to the so called-turbo principle. Simulation results show that the new CA DOA estimation scheme lies between the two extreme direction finding schemes: completely non-data aided (NDA) and data-aided (DA) estimations. Moreover, the new CA DOA estimator reaches the corresponding CA Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), over a wide range of practical SNRs thereby confirming its statistical efficiency in practice. The proposed scheme can be applied to systems, as well, when they are decoded with the turbo principle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324424/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601234","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Code-Aided Direction Finding in Turbo-Coded Square-QAM Transmissions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Aided Direction Finding in Turbo-Coded Square-QAM Transmissions","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066135S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7324426,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Landau","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Landau","id":"37848235900"},{"name":"Meik Dorpinghaus","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Meik","lastName":"Dorpinghaus","id":"37425852600"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37077342100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324426","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324426","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Signal to noise ratio","Markov processes","Bandwidth","Receivers","Entropy","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","quadrature phase shift keying","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","runlength codes","signal sampling","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantization","oversampling","receiver","Nyquist signaling","sequence design","time domain","amplitude domain","multigigabit communication","faster-than-Nyquist QPSK signals","run-length limited sequences","optimized Markov source","expectation based Blahut-Arimoto algorithm","auxiliary channel","spectral efficiency","word length 1 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324426","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communications Employing 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling at the Receiver: Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling and Sequence Design","abstract":"From circuit perspective, the resolution in time domain might be less difficult to achieve as compared to resolution in amplitude domain. Especially when considering Multigigabit communication the resolution in amplitude has remarkable power consumption. In this investigation some practical communication designs are proposed which exploit the utilization of 1- bit quantization and oversampling at the receiver. The proposed approach is the employment of faster- than-Nyquist QPSK signals in combination with an appropriate sequence design. Two sequence design strategies are proposed, namely the utilization of run-length limited sequences and the utilization of an optimized Markov source via an expectation based Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Numerical results on the achievable data rate are computed based on an auxiliary channel lower bound which becomes tight in the high SNR regime. The results on the proposed methods and especially the run-length limited sequence based approach show superior performance in terms of achievable rate and spectral efficiency as compared to conventional signaling with independent and uniformly distributed symbols. Furthermore the performance is close to and even above as compared to an analytical result on the achievable rate when sampling the sign of a specific bandlimited process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324426/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15601242","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Communications Employing 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling at the Receiver: Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling and Sequence Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications Employing 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling at the Receiver: Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling and Sequence Design","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055006S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7324427,"authors":[{"name":"Nour Zaarour","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Nour","lastName":"Zaarour","id":"37085733493"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Nahi Kandil","affiliation":["LRTCS-Universite du Qu\u00e9bec en Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Val-d'Or, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Nahi","lastName":"Kandil","id":"37266138000"},{"name":"Nadir Hakem","affiliation":["LRTCS-Universite du Qu\u00e9bec en Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Val-d'Or, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Nadir","lastName":"Hakem","id":"37330418900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Loss measurement","Training","Frequency measurement","Biological neural networks","Wireless communication","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","mining","multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","telecommunication computing","underground communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path loss channel modeling","mine environment","wireless telecommunication systems","harsh environment","path loss fading","underground former gold mine","artificial neural networks","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function","path loss attenuation","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324427","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324427.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Study on a 60 GHz Path Loss Channel Modeling in a Mine Environment Using Neural Networks","abstract":"A precise and accurate channel model is essential in conceiving and designing wireless telecommunication systems.

The CB weights are designed so as to minimize the interferences plus noises' powers while maintaining the received power from the source to a constant level. We show, however, that they are intractable in closed-form due to the complexity of the polychromatic channels arising from the presence of scattering in real-world environments. By recurring to a two-ray channel approximation proved valid at relatively low angular spread (AS) values, we are able to derive the new optimum weights and prove that they could be locally computed at each terminal, thereby complying with the distributed feature of the network of interest. The so-obtained bichromatic distributed collaborative beamforming (B-DCB) is then analyzed and compared in performance to the monochromatic CB (MCB), whose design does not account for scattering, and the optimal CSI-based CB (OCB). It is shown that the proposed B-DCB outperforms its counterparts in real-world environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324437/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601278","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324437/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Collaborative Beamforming Design in Scattered-Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Collaborative Beamforming Design in Scattered-Environments","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056782S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7324439,"authors":[{"name":"Slim Zaidi","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montr\u00e9al, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37402854000"},{"name":"Bouthaina Hmidet","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montr\u00e9al, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Bouthaina","lastName":"Hmidet","id":"37085666076"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montr\u00e9al, Qc, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324439","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Array signal processing","Collaboration","Wireless sensor networks","Signal to noise ratio","Random variables","Graphical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-constrained signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","optimal collaborative beamformer","OCB design","nonlocal CSI","NLCSI","polychromatic structure","multiray structure","distributed CB design","DCB design","monochromatic DCB","M-DCB","single-ray DCB","bichromatic DCB","B-DCB","two-ray DCB","polychromatic-channel approximation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a power-constrained signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-optimal collaborative beamformer(OCB) design in highly-scattered environments.

Exploiting, the polychromatic (i.e., multi-ray) structure of scattered channels, we propose a novel distributed CB (DCB) design whose weights depends solely on local CSI (LCSI) and prove that it performs nearly as well as its NLCSI-based counterpart. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed LCSI-based DCB outperforms two other distributed-implementation benchmarks: the monochromatic (i.e., single-ray) DCB (M-DCB) whose design ignores the presence of scattering and the bichromatic (i.e., two-ray) DCB (B-DCB) which relies on an efficient polychromatic-channel approximation by two rays when the angular spread is relatively small.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324439","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324439.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324439","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Implementation of Collaborative Beamforming in Highly-Scattered Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Implementation of Collaborative Beamforming in Highly-Scattered Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324439/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324439/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601252","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Implementation of Collaborative Beamforming in Highly-Scattered Environments","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049302S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324444,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afana","id":"38469714700"},{"name":"Ibrahem Atawi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ibrahem","lastName":"Atawi","id":"37085426388"},{"name":"Salama Ikki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Salama","lastName":"Ikki","id":"38262743800"},{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Raed","lastName":"Mesleh","id":"37296995700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324444","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Modulation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","energy conservation","error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation","radio spectrum management","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient quadrature spatial modulation","MIMO cognitive radio systems","imperfect channel estimation","energy efficient multiple-input multiple-output transmission paradigm","spectral efficient MIMO transmission paradigm","spatial constellation diagram","spatial modulation system","SM system","CR techniques","QSM-MIMO-CR systems","channel estimation errors","CEE","pairwise error probability","PEP","average bit error rate","ABER","Rayleigh fading","signal power"]}],"abstract":"Quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) in cognitive radio (CR) is a new spectral and energy efficient multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission paradigm. In QSM, the spatial constellation diagram of conventional spatial modulation (SM) system is extended to include both in-phase and quadrature components of the data symbol. As such, QSM combined with CR techniques achieve significant improvement in the overall spectral efficiency while inherent advantages of SM are retained. In this paper, we study the performance of QSM-MIMO-CR systems in the presence of channel estimation errors (CEEs) and limited feedback. A closed-form expression for the average pairwise error probability (PEP) of CR system is derived and used to calculate a tight upper bound of the average bit error rate (ABER) over Rayleigh fading. In addition, a simple asymptotic expression is derived and analyzed. Simulation results, which corroborate the numerical ones, show the importance of QSM in improving the overall secondary performance and its robustness to CEEs with reduced signal

Time dispersion and coherence bandwidth results are analyzed at both 40 m and 70 m levels of the mine. Different antenna configurations such as horn-horn and horn- omni in a line of sight (LOS) situation have been considered during the measurements. In contrast to conventional indoor millimetre wave channels, the channel in the underground mine is highly reflective, resulting in a rich scattering environment with significant RMS delay spread. Based on the obtained measurement results, the bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated for a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system.

We propose to utilize the spare bits of the OpenFlow packet model to facilitate implementation of virtual networks.To showcase the effectiveness of HetNet cloud model in managing virtual wireless networks, interference management and traffic offloading between two virtual heterogeneous wireless networks have been demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324454","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324454.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HetNet Cloud: Leveraging SDN & Cloud Computing for Wireless Access Virtualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324454/","displayDocTitle":"HetNet Cloud: Leveraging SDN & Cloud Computing for Wireless Access Virtualization","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324454/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601154","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HetNet Cloud: Leveraging SDN & Cloud Computing for Wireless Access Virtualization","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066252S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324460,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Eshteiwi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, LaCIME Laboratory, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Eshteiwi","id":"37085357800"},{"name":"Georges Kaddoum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, LaCIME Laboratory, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Kaddoum","id":"37398102200"},{"name":"Francois Gagnon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, LaCIME Laboratory, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37276754800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324460","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324460","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) and the throughput of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying with imperfect channel estimation and in the presence of a jammer in the network.

In fact, we believe that the co-channel interference can be managed by allowing strong macro interferers to communicate with nearby femtos. In this context, while multiple femtos are available in the area, one important question is: Which femto must be selected to serve the strong MU in order to more efficiently control the co-channel interference? In this regard, we assume that the MU of interest is located near a given number of femtos. Making use of this availability, we investigate a framework for establishing communication between the macro base station (MBS) and the MU of interest via the femto network while considering an appropriate constraint on the interference received at the neighboring MU. Then, we propose utilizing two major selection schemes, namely, \\emph{partial} and \\emph{reactive} selections, to find the appropriate FBS that can better match the femto capacity limitations. We also investigate the average bit error probability of the proposed system for both mentioned selection strategies. Finally, illustrative numerical results are shown and the benefits of using cooperative transmission with different selection strategies are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324489","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324489.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Open-Access Macro-Femto Networks with Femto Base Station Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324489/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Open-Access Macro-Femto Networks with Femto Base Station Selection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601274","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324489/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Open-Access Macro-Femto Networks with Femto Base Station Selection","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.217016S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324492,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Sang Wu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279270400"},{"name":"Chenxuan Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Chenxuan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085687932"},{"name":"Nathan Neihart","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Neihart","id":"37396401300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324492","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Power demand","Throughput","Cascading style sheets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","energy conservation","radio spectrum management","signal detection","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum spectrum sensing bandwidth","cognitive radio communication","cognitive radio network","energy efficiency maximization","economical green wireless network","CO2 emission reduction","primary user spectrum occupancy","cooperative spectrum sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324492","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324492.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Sensing Bandwidth for Energy-Efficient Cognitive Radio Communications","abstract":"Cognitive radio may discover more idle (unoccupied) spectrum by spending more power for spectrum sensing, while the transmission power can be reduced by using more spectrum (bandwidth).

However, it results in poor power amplifier (PA) efficiency or otherwise suffers from severe nonlinear distortion since the transmit signals have high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). To mitigate this, DFT-precoded OFDM has been adopted in the uplink of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, which virtually forms single-carrier signals and thus generates lower PAPR than the original OFDM. Nevertheless, the insertion of precoding for OFDM generally complicates the design of optimal detection and suboptimal detection is usually employed. Therefore, the DFT- precoded OFDM with suboptimal detection shows performance inferior to the original OFDM over frequency-selective fading channels when both the systems are protected by channel coding. This observation raises a question if the DFT-precoded OFDM system can outperform OFDM when nonlinearity associate with PA is also considered. In this work, we compare the performance of coded OFDM with and without DFT precoding where both PA nonlinearity and frequency selectiveness of channels are taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324496","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Coded OFDM with DFT-Precoding over Nonlinear Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Coded OFDM with DFT-Precoding over Nonlinear Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324496/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601270","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324496/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Coded OFDM with DFT-Precoding over Nonlinear Channels","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061779S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324497,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Soujeri","affiliation":["University of Qu\u00e9bec, Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Soujeri","id":"37085342592"},{"name":"Georges Kaddoum","affiliation":["University of Qu\u00e9bec, Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Kaddoum","id":"37398102200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324497","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Detectors","Bit error rate","MIMO","Modulation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","estimation theory","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","modulation","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","telecommunication links","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial modulation detectors","SM system","channel impairments","multiple antenna transmission","transmit antenna","information data","bit sequence","channel links","receive antenna","channel state information","bit-error-ratio","BER","minimum mean square error","maximum likelihood detector","optimum detector","Rayleigh fading channels","channel correlation","multiple-input multiple-output techniques"]}],"abstract":"Spatial modulation (SM) is a multiple antenna transmission approach that uses the index of the transmitting antenna for delivering information data. The choice on the transmitting antenna depends on the incoming bit sequence and has a random nature. The receiver estimates the transmitted symbol and the active transmit antenna index and uses both estimations to retrieve the original information bits. For best reception, individual channel links between transmit and receive antenna pairs must be unique. In fact, correct reception totally depends on the uniqueness of channel coefficients. Incorrectly interpreting channel state information at the receiver causes the BER performance to degrade and the detection to fall short. In this paper, we develop a channel model that incorporates both correlated and imperfect channel state information and use this model to study the bit-error-ratio (BER) performance of most widely used SM detectors, namely the minimum mean square error, the maximum likelihood and the optimum detector in flat Rayleigh fading channels to examine the sensitivity these detectors exhibit to the presence of either channel correlation or imperfect channel state information. The capacity of SM system is studied in comparison to other multiple-input multiple-output techniques and the influence of channel impairments on the overall system capacity is observed.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324497","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Spatial Modulation Detectors under Channel Impairments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Spatial Modulation Detectors under Channel Impairments","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324497/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601241","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Spatial Modulation Detectors under Channel Impairments","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049061S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324498,"authors":[{"name":"Prabagarane Nagaradjane","affiliation":["Department of ECE, SSN Institutions, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Prabagarane","lastName":"Nagaradjane","id":"37393041200"},{"name":"Tamilarasi Muthu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pondicherry Engineering College, Pondicherry, India"],"firstName":"Tamilarasi","lastName":"Muthu","id":"38243449600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324498","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"The performance of a cooperative downlink (DL) time-frequency (TF) spread multi-carrier direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MC-DS-CDMA) system in the presence of multi-user interference (MUI) and inter-relay interference (IRI) is considered in this paper. Transmitter preprocessing (TP) is employed at the base station (BS) to suppress the MUI at the relay stations (RSs). Similarly, we employ TP at the RSs to mitigate the effects of IRI at the DMSs. Specifically, the TP operated at the BS is based on the orthogonal subspace approach whilst, the TP op-erated at the RSs is based on the classical transmit zero-forcing (TZF) principle. Furthermore, the channel knowledge that is re-quired to formulate the preprocessing matrix especially at the BS is based on the quantized feedback of the channel state information (CSI), while that required at the relays is based on perfect CSI. Our simulation study shows that the TP efficiently suppresses the MUI and IRI at the RSs and DMSs, respectively, thus, greatly con-tributing to achieve the relay-diversity under perfect channel knowledge assumption both at the BS and the RSs in the context of TP construction. Also, it is inferred that, the TP based on quantized channel knowledge results in bit-error-rate (BER) performance that is close enough to that obtained with the perfect channel knowledge

In particular, this paper proposes a powersaving scheme that unifies the cyclic sleep mechanism defined for PON's optical network units (ONUs) and the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism defined for LTE's user equipments (UEs) to reduce the overall power consumption in the envisioned network. For performance evaluation, a comprehensive energy saving model and an end-to-end packet delay analysis for M2M scenarios are presented taking into account both optical backhaul and wireless front-end networks based on an M/G/1 queueing model (for backhaul) and a semi-Markov process (for frontend). Results show that the battery life of M2M devices can be significantly prolonged by extending DRX cycle, while the energy consumption of the optical backhaul network can be minimized by exploiting TDMA scheduling for ONU cyclic sleep implementation. Further, the trade-off between overall energy saving and end-to-end packet delay is studied to specify maximum achievable energy saving while not violating delay constraints.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324500.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Saving Scheme for PON LTE-A Converged Networks Supporting M2M Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324500/","displayDocTitle":"Power-Saving Scheme for PON LTE-A Converged Networks Supporting M2M Communications","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601143","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Saving Scheme for PON LTE-A Converged Networks Supporting M2M Communications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07137S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324501,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Maltsev","affiliation":["Intel Corporation","University of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Maltsev","id":"37274004200"},{"name":"Ali Sadri","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sadri","id":"37346795400"},{"name":"Carlos Cordeiro","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Cordeiro","id":"37277649400"},{"name":"Andrey Pudeyev","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Pudeyev","id":"37947596700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324501","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Phased arrays","Throughput","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LOS MIMO technique","short-range millimeter-wave system","digital multimedia content","wireless connectivity","input-output interface","mmWave technique","multiinput multioutput transmission","line-of-sight communication channel","stream separation technique","radio front-end","polarization","low-power phased antenna array","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"The widespread availability and use of digital multimedia content has created a need for faster wireless connectivity that current commercial standards cannot support. For example, new generation of display and input-output (IO) interfaces require data rates well in excess of 10 Gbps. The large amount of spectrum in the unlicensed 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band offers the most promising approach to meet this challenge, but existing standards operating in this band are limited to data rates below 7 Gbps. Therefore, in this paper we propose a practical mmWave technique that combines the benefits of multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) transmissions and a line-of-sight (LOS) communication channel, hereby referred to as LOS MIMO. Different implementations for LOS MIMO using various options for stream separation techniques including separation in the radio front-end (RF), in the baseband, or by polarization are also discussed. The performance of these LOS MIMO implementations is evaluated by simulations. We show that LOS MIMO systems based on low-power phased antenna arrays can operate at the distances up to several meters and achieve data rates above ten Gbps, thus meeting the requirement of the new generation high-speed interfaces.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical LOS MIMO Technique for Short-Range Millimeter-Wave Systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324501","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Practical LOS MIMO Technique for Short-Range Millimeter-Wave Systems","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324501/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601243","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical LOS MIMO Technique for Short-Range Millimeter-Wave Systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1171440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041204S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324503,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Lu","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37276878500"},{"name":"Satoshi Imata","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Imata","id":"37874198100"},{"name":"Naoyasu Kamiya","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyasu","lastName":"Kamiya","id":"38468335100"},{"name":"Nobuo Suzuki","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37085661519"},{"name":"Kazunori Takeuchi","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37391081000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324503","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave propagation","Permittivity","Floors","Interchannel interference","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave propagation","railway communication","ray tracing","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation characteristics","millimeter wave communication deployment","bullet train car","wireless LAN system","ray tracing method","millimeter wave access points","millimeter wave communications","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Characteristics and Deployment of Millimeter Wave Communication in Bullet Train Car","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324503","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324503","abstract":"This paper deals with propagation characteristics of 60GHz band millimeter wave communication systems and technical issues on how to deploy millimeter wave enabled access points (APs) in passenger car of bullet trains.

Since the antennas for a virtual device are located on different physical devices, applying previous beamforming methods requires the exchange of the channel state information (CSI) between the UEs within a virtual device which in turn induces a significant overhead. This paper shows how the iterative beamforming can be performed without sharing this CSI.

The increase penetration of wireless technology in healthcare environment for powering, monitoring and sensing purposes of implanted or attached devices to human patients' triggered new challenges in designing reconfigurable wireless transceiver intended for healthcare that can operate in multi-frequency mode. To minimize the number of RF receivers needed for these kind of applications, a broadband subsampling receiver is proposed. Recently, this technique has been proposed for software defined radio (SDR) applications to allow multiple and concurrent RF signal digitization directly from the RF stage by using a sampling frequency much lower than the RF frequency. In this paper, band-pass sub-sampling technique widely used in many applications, such as radar, sonar, data acquisition, measurement and instrumentation is reviewed. An efficient subsampling algorithm is proposed to determine the sampling frequency needed such that interferences between the different monitoring and sensing medical signals is mitigated. Measurement results are provided with RF instrumentation equipment and a low speed ADC to validate the proposed architecture for multi- frequency monitoring and sensing applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324513","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Defined Radio Subsampling Receiver for Wireless Monitoring and Sensing Medical Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Software Defined Radio Subsampling Receiver for Wireless Monitoring and Sensing Medical Applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601166","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Defined Radio Subsampling Receiver for Wireless Monitoring and Sensing Medical Applications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048652S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7324516,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohang Song","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiaohang","lastName":"Song","id":"37085401259"},{"name":"Lukas Landau","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Landau","id":"37848235900"},{"name":"Johannes Israel","affiliation":["Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Israel","id":"37085432554"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37077342100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6555-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6554-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"7324516","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a wireless data bus system design which relies on a strong Line-of- Sight MIMO approach. An analog MIMO equalizer, which equalizes the deterministic MIMO channel is involved. Instead of interference suppression, the analog MIMO equalizer aligns the phases of the received signals and enhances the desired signal while it suppresses the undesired ones simultaneously. Although the magnitudes of different signal components of the received signals are preferred to be unique, further studies are applied in our work to investigate the validation of our system design with non-unique magnitudes by using practical on-board antennas. It is shown that the proposed system works well with non-unique magnitudes where undesired remaining interference occurs with limited power in comparison with the desired ones. Furthermore, the proposed design shows a great potential for putting a 1 Tbps wireless data bus into practical systems with moderate transmit power and fairly simple modulation schemes which provide high energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321106/7324387/07324516.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strong LOS MIMO for Short Range mmWave Communication - Towards 1 Tbps Wireless Data Bus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","equalisers","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short range mmWave communication","wireless data bus","strong line-of-sight MIMO approach","analog MIMO equalizer","deterministic MIMO channel","interference suppression","received signals","signal components","on-board antennas","transmit power","modulation schemes","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Strong LOS MIMO for Short Range mmWave Communication - Towards 1 Tbps Wireless Data Bus","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324516/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601193","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strong LOS MIMO for Short Range mmWave Communication - Towards 1 Tbps Wireless Data Bus","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1169154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089429S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321106","isNumber":"7324387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321106","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7324387","articleId":"7324516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324521,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Abu Alkheir","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ala Abu","lastName":"Alkheir","id":"38246674600"},{"name":"Irfan Al-Anbagi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Al-Anbagi","id":"38321185600"},{"name":"Hussein T.

By considering the frequency of errors, the proposed pooled group approach requires fewer hardware blocks than in a traditional multi-channel configuration with a negligible impact on performance. Combined with a specialized root finding unit for blocks with only 1 error, our scheme reduces hardware area by 47%-71% and dynamic power by 44%-59% with 2% performance degradation in typical NAND flash systems.

The emerging Multi-Level Cells (MLC) STT-RAM memory technology improves the capacity and energy efficiency issues of large-sized memory banks. However, MLC STT-RAM incurs non-negligible protection overhead to ensure reliable operations when compared to the Single-Level Cells (SLC) STT-RAM. In this paper, we propose an approximation-aware MLC STT-RAM cache architecture, which is partially-protected to restrict the reliability overhead and in turn leverages variable resilience characteristics of different applications for adaptively curtailing the protection overhead under a given error tolerance level. It thereby improves the energy-efficiency of the cache while meeting the reliability requirements. Our cache architecture is equipped with a latency-aware hardware module for double-error correction. To achieve high energy efficiency, approximation-aware read and write policies are proposed that perform approximate storage management while tolerating some errors bounded within the user-provided tolerance level. The architecture also facilitates runtime control on the quality of applications' results. We perform a case study on the next-generation advanced video encoding that exhibit memory-intensive functional blocks with varying resilience properties and support for parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that our approximation-aware MLC STT-RAM based cache architecture can improve the energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art fully-protected caches (7%-19%, on average), while incurring minimal quality penalties in the output (-0.219% to -0.426%, on average). Furthermore, our architecture supports complete error protection coverage for all cache data when processing non-resilient application. The hardware overhead to implement our approximation-aware management negligibly affects the energy efficiency (0.15%-1.3% of overhead) and the access latency (only 0.02%-1.56% of overhead).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324548/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15589629","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximation-aware Multi-Level Cells STT-RAM cache architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation-aware Multi-Level Cells STT-RAM cache architecture","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098797S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313573","isNumber":"7324531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313573","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7324531","articleId":"7324548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7324549,"authors":[{"name":"Arnab Raha","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Raha","id":"38232267200"},{"name":"Hrishikesh Jayakumar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Hrishikesh","lastName":"Jayakumar","id":"37085493424"},{"name":"Soubhagya Sutar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Soubhagya","lastName":"Sutar","id":"38242531200"},{"name":"Vijay Raghunathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37271022500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8320-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324549","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Resource management","Arrays","Memory management","Capacitors","Error analysis","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-aware data allocation","approximate computing","design paradigm","error tolerance","power consumption","error-resilient applications","energy savings","quality-aware approximate DRAM system","memory errors","Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA","Terasic TR4-230 development board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate Computing","Intrinsic Application Resilience","Low Power Design","DRAM Power Management"]}],"abstract":"Approximate computing is an emerging design paradigm that leverages the inherent error tolerance present in many applications to optimize their power consumption and performance. Due to the forgiving nature of these error-resilient applications, highly precise input data is not always necessary for them to produce outputs of acceptable quality. This makes memory, the place where data is stored, a suitable component for introducing errors or approximations in return for considerable energy savings. Towards this end, this paper proposes, for the first time, a systematic way for constructing a quality-aware approximate DRAM system. Our design is based upon an extensive experimental characterization of memory errors as a function of the DRAM refresh rate. Leveraging the insights gathered from this characterization, we propose four novel strategies for partitioning the DRAM into a number of quality bins based on the frequency, location, and nature of bit errors in each of the physical pages. During allocation, critical data is placed in the highest quality bin containing only accurate pages and approximate data is allocated to bins sorted in descending order of quality. We validate our proposed scheme on several error-resilient applications implemented using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA based Terasic TR4-230 development board containing a 1GB DDR3 DRAM module. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the energy-quality trade-off compared to previous work and show a reduction in DRAM refresh power of up to 73% with minimal loss in output quality.","doi":"10.1109/CASES.2015.7324549","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313573/7324531/07324549.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASES.2015.7324549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-aware data allocation in approximate DRAM*","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Quality-aware data allocation in approximate DRAM*","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324549/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15589619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324549/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-aware data allocation in approximate DRAM*","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053337S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313573","isNumber":"7324531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313573","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7324531","articleId":"7324549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7324551,"authors":[{"name":"Eriko Nurvitadhi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Eriko","lastName":"Nurvitadhi","id":"37393992500"},{"name":"Asit Mishra","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Asit","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37595168200"},{"name":"Debbie Marr","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Debbie","lastName":"Marr","id":"37085713782"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8320-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324551","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":735},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Software algorithms","Hardware","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file servers","matrix multiplication","sparse matrices","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse matrix vector multiply accelerator","support vector machine","sparse matrix vector multiplication","SpMV","linear algebra","machine learning algorithms","ML algorithms","SVM software","libSVM","energy-efficient microserver","high-performance server","real-world ML datasets","hardware accelerator architecture design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware accelerator","machine learning","support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"Sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) is a linear algebra construct commonly found in machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM).

Near-data processing has started to gain acceptance as an accelerator device due to the technology constraints and high costs associated with data transfer. However, previous approaches to near-data computing do not provide general-purpose processing, or require large amounts of logic and do not fully use the potential of the DRAM devices. These issues limited its wide adoption. In this paper, we present the Memory Vector Extensions (MVX), which implement vector instructions directly inside the DRAM devices, therefore avoiding data movement between memory and processing units, while requiring a lower amount of logic than previous approaches. MVX is able to obtain up to 211\u00d7 increase in performance for application kernels with a high spatial locality and a low temporal locality. Comparing to an embedded processor with 8 cores and 2 memory channels that supports AVX-512 instructions, MVX performs 24\u00d7 faster on average for three well known algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CASES.2015.7324552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASES.2015.7324552","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313573/7324531/07324552.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Saving memory movements through vector processing in the DRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589624","htmlLink":"/document/7324552/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saving memory movements through vector processing in the DRAM","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086872S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313573","isNumber":"7324531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313573","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7324531","articleId":"7324552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324558,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Atoofian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Atoofian","id":"38642953900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8320-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324558","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Magnetic tunneling","Instruction sets","Magnetic domains","Graphics processing units","Power demand","Magnetic domain walls"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","multi-threading","optimising compilers","power aware computing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shift penalty reduction","domain wall memory","register locality","general-purpose graphics processing units","GPGPUs","extreme multithreading","context switching","DWM","spin-based memory","power consumption reduction","register file","ferromagnetic wire","predictive shift policy","NVIDIA CUDA SDK","ISPASS","Rodinia"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain Wall Memory","Register File","GPGPU"]}],"abstract":"General-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) have the ability to execute hundreds to thousands of threads simultaneously. Extreme multithreading requires a large register file to hold state of executing threads and facilitate context switching. As feature size reduces, power consumption in the large register file becomes a major concern. In this work, we exploit Domain Wall Memory (DWM) which is a spin-based memory to reduce power consumption in register file. DWM is a promising technology and offers non-volatility, high energy efficiency, and high density by storing several bits into the domains of a ferromagnetic wire. However, despite of favourable properties of DMW over SRAM technology, DWM poses a unique challenge that the bits must be accessed serially through shift operations, leading to variable and potentially higher access latencies. To address this challenge, we propose a new predictive shift policy. In this policy, we exploit register locality across threads and predict source and destination operands of instructions. We record history of registers accessed by instructions and shift magnetic domains of DWM tracks for subsequent instructions, speculatively. Over a wide range of applications from NVIDIA CUDA SDK, ISPASS, and Rodinia, our predictive scheme achieves dramatic energy saving over an SRAM register file while changing performance negligibly.","doi":"10.1109/CASES.2015.7324558","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313573/7324531/07324558.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASES.2015.7324558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing shift penalty in Domain Wall Memory through register locality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reducing shift penalty in Domain Wall Memory through register locality","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324558/","accessionNumber":"15589640","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing shift penalty in Domain Wall Memory through register locality","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075733S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313573","isNumber":"7324531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313573","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7324531","articleId":"7324558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7324644,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjun Xia","affiliation":["School of Electronic Electrical and System Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Mingjun","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085362007"},{"name":"H.

wireless systems directly impact the throughput requirements of the modulation and coding systems of the physical layer. In an effort to design a suitable channel coding solution for 5G wireless systems, in this brief we present two approaches to improve the throughput of a Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) decoder architecture. While providing an algorithmic method to enhance parallel processing within the decoder in the first approach, in the second approach we apply the decoder architecture to achieve another highly-parallel architecture. We have successfully validated the second approach to get a 2.48Gb/s QC-LDPC decoder implementation operating at 200MHz on the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA in the NI USRP-2953R. For rapid-prototyping our research findings, the high-level description of the entire decoder was translated to a Hardware Description Language (HDL), namely VHDL, using the algorithmic compiler in the National Instruments LabVIEW\u2122 Communication System Design Suite (CSDS\u2122). As per our knowledge, at the time of writing this paper, this is the fastest FPGA-based implementation of a standard compliant QC-LDPC decoder on a USRP using an algorithmic compiler.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2015.7324649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2015.7324649","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"2015 36th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 36th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312262/7324628/07324649.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.48Gb/s FPGA-based QC-LDPC decoder: An algorithmic compiler implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324649/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 2.48Gb/s FPGA-based QC-LDPC decoder: An algorithmic compiler implementation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15600518","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324649/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.48Gb/s FPGA-based QC-LDPC decoder: An algorithmic compiler implementation","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p88mhaske.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080113S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312262","isNumber":"7324628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312262","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7324628","articleId":"7324649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7324655,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085660029"},{"name":"Yu-Dong Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Yu-Dong","lastName":"Yao","id":"37275325500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8042-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8043-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324655","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Resource management","Interference","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary user scheduling","cognitive radio networks","transmit beamforming","interference mitigation","fixed transmit power allocation","adaptive transmit power allocation","ATPA","FTPA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324655","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2015.7324655","publicationTitle":"2015 36th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","abstract":"Reducing interference to primary users while achieving high throughput for secondary user transmissions is a critical issue in an underlay cognitive radio network.

The main objective is to compare, for different antenna configurations and different transmission modes, the bandwidth required to be allocated to the Cluster Head (CH) to serve all connected Cluster Nodes (CN). For this purpose, we consider the average statistical behavior of the network and we assume that the active nodes are randomly distributed according to a Poisson Point Process. We base our dimensioning results on the computation of an upper-bound on the resource outage probability.

Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are employed to lower the collision rates through organizing the access to the communication channels. The simplicity of future wireless networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) implies the need for rather simple MAC protocols, which would, in-turn require collision resolution between the packets simultaneously transmitted by multiple users. Slotted-ALOHA is a simple MAC protocol which has a limited throughput (36%) that is still very low to support future wireless applications. The goal of this paper is to gain deep understanding of how to improve the throughput and reduce the collision rate of slotted-ALOHA MAC protocol. In particular, we propose a novel Multi-Dimensional Slotted ALOHA (MDSA) protocol that combines the advantages of TDMA, FDMA and CDMA. MDSA protocol utilizes three dimensional reservation bands, i.e., time dimension, frequency dimension and code dimension. In this paper, we show theoretically how the successful reservation rates increase and the collision rates decrease with MDSA under idle and noisy channel conditions, which qualify our proposed scheme to be a reliable MAC protocol for wireless communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 36th IEEE Sarnoff

Despite its large median value, the overall HRS/LRS ratio in these devices can be drastically reduced due to the LRS and HRS dispersion, especially in a low-current regime. For this reason, in this study we adopt a statistical approach, focusing on the tails of the cumulative distribution Function (CDF). Using different verify-based algorithms we force an initial tail-to-tail (1st percentile of CDF) resistive window, demonstrating that, in order to reduce the total programming time, a complete Write/Erase cycle must be performed at each verify step.

The PPD (schematized in Fig. 1a) consists in a buried photodiode, where the surface p+ implant, also referred to as pinning-implant, pins the surface at the substrate potential. This peculiar structure not only reduces the dark current (by isolating the PPD from the charges generated at the SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-Si interface), but also limits the maximum PPD potential, often referred to as pinning voltage [4], which corresponds to the full depletion condition. The presence of this \u201cpotential floor\u201d enables true charge transfer from the PPD to the collection node (or to another buried channel), whereas in standard photodiodes only charge sharing between two capacitances is possible. The combination of these unique features has led in the last decade to the development of several PPD-based detectors for high speed applications, such as Time of Flight (ToF) applications [5]-[8], which require high speed readout of small packets of photo-charges. One of the main challenges involved in PPD-based high speed detectors is to reach the best temporal resolution by maximizing the charge transfer speed from the photo-generation site to the collection node. The transfer speed becomes even more critical for applications, such as space imaging applications, which require pixel pitches of several tens of \u03bcm (for example for optics-related constraints [9]). In the last decade much effort has been put into improving charge transfer speed by introducing a drift field in the PPD by modulating the PPD local potential [5], [7], [10]-[13]. However the existing solutions often involve design and/or geometrical constraints, can require the use of a custom technology, or might not be implementable for large pixel pitches (where only a small drift field can be induced, as the maximum potential variation which can be generated within the PPD is equal to the pinning voltage [14], which is often of the order of 1V, or lower, to ensure optimum charge transfer toward the floating diffusion (FD)).","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2015.7324737","publicationTitle":"2015 45th European Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 45th European Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7300344/7324696/07324737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2015.7324737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324696","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge transfer speed analysis in pinned photodiode CMOS image sensors based on a pulsed storage-gate method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Charge transfer speed analysis in pinned photodiode CMOS image sensors based on a pulsed storage-gate method","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15598790","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge transfer speed analysis in pinned photodiode CMOS image sensors based on a pulsed storage-gate method","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"D039B2LE41114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081641S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7300344","isNumber":"7324696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7300344","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7324696","articleId":"7324737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324758,"authors":[{"name":"Razaidi Hussin","affiliation":["School of Microelectronic Engineering Universiti Malaysia Perlis","Device Modelling Group, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Razaidi","lastName":"Hussin","id":"37085444271"},{"name":"Louis Gerrer","affiliation":["Device Modelling Group, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Gerrer","id":"37567975800"},{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["Device Modelling Group, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085357725"},{"name":"Liping Wang","affiliation":["Device Modelling Group, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087607739"},{"name":"Salvatore M.

Careful systematic experiment, dedicated characterization techniques, and physics-based simulations are exploited to gain insights into the physics of this phenomenon. The RTN parameters (amplitude of the current fluctuations, capture and emission times) observed in the experiments are analyzed in a variety of operating conditions. Anomalous behaviors are examined and their statistical characteristics are analyzed. Physics-based simulations taking into account both the Coulomb interactions among different defects in the device and the possibility for defects to show metastable states are exploited to suggest a possible origin of the aRTN. Results highlight the importance of the electrostatic interactions among individual defects and the trapped charge.","publicationTitle":"2015 45th European Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 45th European Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7300344/7324696/07324766.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2015.7324766","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2015.7324766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of anomalous Random Telegraph Noise in Resistive Random Access Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of anomalous Random Telegraph Noise in Resistive Random Access Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324766/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7324766/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15598820","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of anomalous Random Telegraph Noise in Resistive Random Access Memory","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"D068C2LF31335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083579S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7300344","isNumber":"7324696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7300344","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7324696","articleId":"7324766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324845,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Fereidouni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Fereidouni","id":"37085560743"},{"name":"Mohammad A.

This scheme is implemented in the stationary reference frame (SRF) to avoid interphase dependency in three-phase floated neutral point (TP-FNP) systems. The space-vector-based method permits for the efficient application of zero-voltage vectors and avoids high switching frequencies triggered by phase interaction in TPFNP systems. The approach comprises of performing two alternative hysteresis strategies around the error vector in SRF. Then, based on the present location of it, the next voltage vector is selected to minimize the next error vector and also balance the capacitor voltages. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated and verified through detailed simulation studies for both steady-state and transient conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Active filters","Hysteresis","Modulation","Transient analysis","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","hysteresis","invertors","power harmonic filters","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-vector hysteresis modulation","neutral-diode-clamped inverter","active power filter application","SVHM technique","TL-NPC multilevel inverter","capacitor voltage balancing","stationary reference frame","interphase dependency avoidance","zero-voltage vector","high switching frequency avoidance","phase interaction","TPFNP system","next error vector minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["APF","space-vector","NPC","current control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AUPEC.2015.7324845","publicationTitle":"2015 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301398/7324780/07324845.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUPEC.2015.7324845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-vector hysteresis modulation for neutral-diode-clamped inverter in active power filter applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-vector hysteresis modulation for neutral-diode-clamped inverter in active power filter applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324845/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324845/","accessionNumber":"15588294","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-vector hysteresis modulation for neutral-diode-clamped inverter in active power filter applications","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"06AUPEC2015submission090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059304S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301398","isNumber":"7324780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301398","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7324780","articleId":"7324845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324846,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Kharrazi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, Murdoch University, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kharrazi","id":"37085690817"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8725-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8724-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7324846","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Production facilities","Genetic algorithms","Modal analysis","MATLAB","Damping","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric power generation","genetic algorithms","mathematics computing","modal analysis","power engineering computing","power system stability","programming languages","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DIgSILENT programming language","cost function","MATLAB optimization toolbox","optimization techniques","conventional power system stabilizers","low frequency oscillation","transient stability","power factory modal analysis","genetic algorithm","SMIB","single machine infinite bus","power system stabilizer tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power system stabilizers","Genetic Algorithm","MATLAB","DIgSILENT","Modal Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324846","abstract":"Power system stabilizers have been widely used in generation systems to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Low frequency oscillation may occur as a result of excitation system which exerts a phase lag. Conventional power system stabilizers using a lead-lag controller have been used in utility for decades.

In this paper tuning of parameters of a Conventional Power System Stabilizer in a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed. The power system is modelled in Power Factory and the optimization is done through MATLAB optimization toolbox. The cost function is to maximize the damping ratio which is calculated using Power Factory Modal Analysis. Using DIgSILENT Programming Language (DPL), a real time data exchange between MATLAB and Power factory is set during optimization process.

In particular, type and number of the connected electronic equipment have a significant impact on PQ levels. Therefore, the introduction of new device technologies on a large scale, like the transition from incandescent to LED lamps, might result in long-term changes to the levels of PQ parameters (e.g. harmonics). Major aims of the paper are the identification and quantification of long-term trends in time series of continuous PQ parameters which can support network operators with the early detection of fundamental changes in PQ levels. This information can e.g. support the asset management or network planning in managing PQ levels using optimized costs. The paper begins with a systematic overview of major factors with impact on PQ levels and continues with a classification of their typical variation behavior (short-term, medium-term and long-term). The analysis of the long-term behavior (trend) starts with the extraction of a smoothed trend component based on time series decomposition. This trend component is used to quantify global trends (looking on the measurement duration as a whole) and local trends (looking on individual segments of the whole time series). Finally, the application of both methods is illustrated for selected voltage and current quality parameters using a set of three year measurements from German LV grids with different consumer configuration.","doi":"10.1109/AUPEC.2015.7324851","publicationTitle":"2015 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301398/7324780/07324851.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUPEC.2015.7324851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trend identification in power quality measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7324851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7324851/","displayDocTitle":"Trend identification in power quality measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15633568","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7324851/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trend identification in power quality measurements","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"06AUPEC2015submission102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111793S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301398","isNumber":"7324780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301398","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7324780","articleId":"7324851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7324866,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Finally the proposed DPC strategy employs a nonlinear robust sliding mode control (SMC) scheme to calculate the required rotor control voltage directly. The concept of sliding mode control is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to determine inertial weights. The new DPC based on SMC-PSO scheme has acceptable harmonic spectra of stator current by using space vector modulation (SVM) block with constant switching frequency.

So far, Earth observation has been carried out only through satellite images, which are limited in resolution and suffer from important barriers such as cloud occlusion. Microdrone solutions, providing video streaming capabilities, are already available on the marketplace, but they are limited to altitudes of a few hundred feet. In contrast, UAVs equipped with high quality cameras can fly at altitudes of a few thousand feet and can fill the gap between satellite observations and ground sensors. Therefore, new needs for data processing arise, spanning from computer vision algorithms to sensor and mission management. This paper presents a solution for automatically detecting changes in images acquired at different times by patrolling UAVs flying over the same targets (but not necessarily along the same path or at the same altitude). Change detection in multi-temporal images is a prerequisite for land cover inspection, which, in turn, sets up the basis for detecting potentially dangerous or threatening situations.","doi":"10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325122","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 1st International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 1st International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302373/7325058/07325122.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically detecting changes and anomalies in unmanned aerial vehicle images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325122/","displayDocTitle":"Automatically detecting changes and anomalies in unmanned aerial vehicle images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15588524","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325122/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically detecting changes and anomalies in unmanned aerial vehicle images","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570153041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081971S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302373","isNumber":"7325058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302373","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7325058","articleId":"7325122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325144,"authors":[{"name":"G.

During the installation phase, it is possible to measure the coordinates of the installation point using a topographic GNSS receiver. The tags positions can evolve with time and after a specific desired period of time (e. g. 1 month or 1 year) it is necessary to relocate them. This can be done estimating the distance between the tags and a UAV, exploiting the measurements of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The tags are placed over an outdoor test area and a large amount of RSSI measurements are made in different position, well distributed in space, using a UAV equipped with a specific tag reader. On such data, a multilateration-based localization algorithm is applied achieving good results. The description of RFID tags is reported together with the localization algorithm, the test description and the preliminary results.","doi":"10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325144","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 1st International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 1st International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302373/7325058/07325144.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325058","startPage":"480","endPage":"483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of RFID tags for environmental monitoring using UAV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization of RFID tags for environmental monitoring using UAV","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325144/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15588554","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7325144/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of RFID tags for environmental monitoring using UAV","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570153095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042642S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302373","isNumber":"7325058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302373","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7325058","articleId":"7325144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7325146,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, topics that evoke a certain emotion in the general public are often context-sensitive, making it difficult to train a universal classifier for all collections. A multilabeled sentiment topic model, namely, the contextual sentiment topic model (CSTM), can be used for adaptive social emotion classification. The CSTM distinguishes context-independent topics from both a background theme, which characterizes nondiscriminative information, and a contextual theme, which characterizes context-dependent information across different collections. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of this model for the adaptive classification of social emotions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7325170/","accessionNumber":"15722372","displayDocTitle":"Contextual Sentiment Topic Model for Adaptive Social Emotion Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contextual Sentiment Topic Model for Adaptive Social Emotion Classification","sourcePdf":"mex2016010041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049639S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"7389903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7389903","articleId":"7325170","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7325177,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Maalej","affiliation":["University of Hamburg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/52/7367974/7325177/7325177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Walid Maalej is a professor of informatics at the University of Hamburg and the chair for applied software technology.

Given a social network, the TaCPP model first integrates the correlations between the content of social communication and social influences and then uses a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength. The authors' experimental evaluation shows not only the effectiveness of their approach but also the correlation of the detected communities with various health outcome measures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15722370","pubMedId":"27087794","htmlLink":"/document/7325206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Topic-Aware Physical Activity Propagation in a Health Social Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topic-Aware Physical Activity Propagation in a Health Social Network","sourcePdf":"mex2016010005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058204S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"7389903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7389903","articleId":"7325206","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":7325227,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Giorgetti","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Giorgetti","id":"37286657700"},{"name":"Andrea Sgambelluri","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sgambelluri","id":"37061943400"},{"name":"Francesco Paolucci","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Paolucci","id":"37305731100"},{"name":"Piero Castoldi","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Castoldi","id":"37085362726"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8051-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8050-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8049-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7325227","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Network topology","Multiprotocol label switching","Topology","IP networks","Ports (Computers)","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprotocol label switching","routing protocols","signalling protocols","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segment routing reliability","traffic engineering technique","MPLS data plane","label stacking","traffic flow steering","signaling protocol","control plane operation","traffic recovery","network congestion avoidance","multiprotocol label switching network failure"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable segment routing","doi":"10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7324297","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International Workshop on Reliable Networks Design and Modeling (RNDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International Workshop on Reliable Networks Design and Modeling (RNDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311668/7324297/07325227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325227","startPage":"181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325227","abstract":"Segment Routing (SR) is a novel traffic engineering technique compatible with traditional MPLS data plane.

This is a multi-objective optimization problem as the physical properties of the harness (e.g., length and weight) as well as the logical properties of the underlying network (survivability and performance) have to be taken into account. We propose in this paper to investigate this multi-objective optimization problem and provide different algorithms to solve it.

Relatively low value of the supply voltage requires that parallel connections within each of the motor phases should be adopted. When selecting optimum pole-arcs of permanent magnets, the relevant analysis concerns not only their influence on the generated cogging torque, electromagnetic torque, and induced voltage, but also circulating currents resulting from the assumed configuration of stator windings. Waveforms of currents, voltages, and the electromagnetic torque are determined for a selected motor working point. Finally, conclusions concerning the analyzed motor are presented.","doi":"10.1109/EDPE.2015.7325338","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (EDPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (EDPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311167/7325253/07325338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDPE.2015.7325338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325253","startPage":"458","endPage":"464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of properties of the BLDC motor for unmanned aerial vehicle hybrid drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of properties of the BLDC motor for unmanned aerial vehicle hybrid drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325338/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589339","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7325338/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of properties of the BLDC motor for unmanned aerial vehicle hybrid drive","confLoc":"Tatranska Lomnica, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071207S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311167","isNumber":"7325253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311167","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7325253","articleId":"7325338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325344,"authors":[{"name":"Tin Bari\u0161a","affiliation":["University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing Unska 3, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tin","lastName":"Bari\u0161a","id":"37085413108"},{"name":"Damir Sumina","affiliation":["University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing Unska 3, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Damir","lastName":"Sumina","id":"37271355000"},{"name":"Martina Kutija","affiliation":["University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing Unska 3, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Kutija","id":"37085433899"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7376-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9661-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1339-3944"}],"articleNumber":"7325344","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Torque","Iron","Electromagnetics","Rotors","Mathematical model","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","losses","machine control","minimisation","permanent magnet generators","synchronous generators","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss minimization control","interior permanent magnet synchronous generator","maximum torque per ampere control","wind energy conversion systems","stator current magnitude minimization","iron losses","copper losses","feed-forward torque control model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interior permanent magnet synchronous generator","maximum torque per ampere","loss minimization","torque control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325344","doi":"10.1109/EDPE.2015.7325344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDPE.2015.7325344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325253","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (EDPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (EDPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311167/7325253/07325344.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of maximum torque per ampere and loss minimization control for the interior permanent magnet synchronous generator","abstract":"In this paper maximum torque per ampere and loss minimization control methods for an interior permanent magnet synchronous generator are compared.

The comparisons demonstrated that the proposed approach is more superior in terms of classification error reduction and overall accuracy improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2015.7325522","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315281/7325510/07325522.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2015.7325522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of power quality disturbances using Wavelet Transform and Optimized ANN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325522/","displayDocTitle":"Classification of power quality disturbances using Wavelet Transform and Optimized ANN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325522/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of power quality disturbances using Wavelet Transform and Optimized ANN","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID3936735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076616S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315281","isNumber":"7325510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315281","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7325510","articleId":"7325522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325540,"authors":[{"name":"Stylianos I.

Conventional electrical power systems do not consider reverse power flow, in which the power flows toward the feeder in the distribution system. When large quantities of distributed generators (DGs) are introduced into a distribution system they can cause voltage deviations beyond the statutory range, resulting in reverse flow toward the substation transformer. Consequently, this causes faults in electric devices and may even lead to a massive blackout. This is an important issue within the distribution system. In order to resolve voltage deviation problems it is necessary to consider some trade-offs. However, it is difficult to consider these trade-offs using single objective-optimization. Furthermore, there is not much published research adapting multi-objective optimization for use in the distribution system. Therefore, this paper provides a method of multi-objective optimization to minimize voltage deviation while simultaneously minimizing the number of introduced voltage control devices and finding an optimum placement of those voltage control devices. Moreover, an optimum scheduling of the distribution system is adopted.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2015.7325560","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315281/7325510/07325560.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2015.7325560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of SVR considering optimum placement and weather conditions in distribution systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Optimization","Meteorology","Sociology","Statistics","Generators","Light rail systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective optimization","SVR","optimum placement","weather conditions","distribution systems","step voltage regulators","electrical power systems","distributed generators","voltage deviation problems","voltage control devices","optimum scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of SVR considering optimum placement and weather conditions in distribution systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601081","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of SVR considering optimum placement and weather conditions in distribution systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID3947867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050667S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315281","isNumber":"7325510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315281","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7325510","articleId":"7325560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7325561,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Pinto","affiliation":["GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Pinto","id":"37666576000"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Barreto","affiliation":["GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Barreto","id":"37074678400"},{"name":"Isabel Pra\u00e7a","affiliation":["GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Pra\u00e7a","id":"37545422000"},{"name":"Gabriel Santos","affiliation":["GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Santos","id":"38493560400"},{"name":"Zita Vale","affiliation":["GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Zita","lastName":"Vale","id":"37271328200"},{"name":"E.

Simulation tools are increasingly being used for decision support purposes of such entities. In particular, multi-agent based simulation, which facilitates the modeling of different types of mechanisms and players, is being fruitfully applied to the study of worldwide electricity markets. An effective decision support to market players' negotiations is, however, still not properly reached due to the uncertainty that results from the increasing penetration of renewable generation and the complexity of market mechanisms themselves. In this scope, this paper proposes a novel metalearner that provides decision support to market players in their negotiations. The proposed metalearner uses as input the output of several other market negotiation strategies, which are used to create a new, enhanced response. The final result is achieved through the combination and evolution of the strategies' learning results by applying a genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325561/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15601082","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325561/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent based metalearner using genetic algorithm for decision support in electricity markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent based metalearner using genetic algorithm for decision support in electricity markets","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"OSO2077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148891S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315281","isNumber":"7325510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315281","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7325510","articleId":"7325561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325564,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshikazu Fukuyama","affiliation":["Department of Network Design, Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Fukuyama","id":"37294621000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0191-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0190-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7325564","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Reactive power","Load modeling","Voltage control","Computational modeling","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","reactive power control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel particle swarm optimization","reactive power control","voltage control","parallel computing","distributed computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reactive power and voltage control","parallel and distributed computing","particle swarm optimization","dependability"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a parallel particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique for reactive power and voltage control (Volt/Var Control: VVC) investigating dependability. High penetration of renewable energies and deregulation of power systems force power flow to change suddenly and operators in control centers have to control voltage in wider power systems. Therefore, VVC is required to shorten the control interval and handle larger-scale power systems. One of the solutions for the problem is applications of parallel and distributed computing. Since power system is one of the infrastructures of social community, sustainable voltage control is crucial and dependability is strongly required for VVC.

Preliminary results show a moderate correlation between satellite observations and ground-based measurements, highlighting the close relationship between the urban pattern and the distribution of NO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n all over the region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7325700/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15615086","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Urban impacts on air quality observed with remote sensing and ground station data from the PO plain field campaign","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban impacts on air quality observed with remote sensing and ground station data from the PO plain field campaign","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0000073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041968S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7325714,"authors":[{"name":"Batuhan Osmanoglu","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD","Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, MD"],"firstName":"Batuhan","lastName":"Osmanoglu","id":"37085460718"},{"name":"Rafael Rincon","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Rincon","id":"37265720200"},{"name":"SeungKuk Lee","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD"],"firstName":"SeungKuk","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407208900"},{"name":"Temilola Fatoyinbo","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD"],"firstName":"Temilola","lastName":"Fatoyinbo","id":"37888681800"},{"name":"David Lagomasino","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD","Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, MD"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lagomasino","id":"38667399100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7325714","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325714","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Array signal processing","Digital filters","Band-pass filters","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","array signal processing","echo","radiofrequency interference","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio frequency interference mitigation technique","radio frequency interference detection technique","radar systems","wideband airborne radars","P-band","EcoSAR 2014 flight campaign","synthetic aperture radar system","wideband digital beamforming architecture","science parameters","EcoSAR measurements","SAR data quality","raw echoes","frequency 435 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFI","SAR","Digital Beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Radio frequency interference (RFI) has strong influence on radar systems, especially for wideband airborne radars operating in the P-band (UHF). EcoSAR is a 435 MHz Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system that employs a wideband digital beamforming architecture for the measurement of science parameters. RFI in EcoSAR measurements, degrades the quality of the SAR data and has to be removed from raw echoes.

First, conventional scan-on-receive (SCORE) is performed in real-time onboard the satellite by employing a set of dispersive beams that maximize the collected signal energy for each transmitted pulse. The range ambiguities are then removed in a second step by a joint processing of the signals collected by the multiple elevation beams. The suggested two-stage approach has the advantage that a more robust range ambiguity suppression, which may involve advanced nulling techniques to account for local topography as well as satellite attitude and instrument phase errors, can be performed on ground without tremendously increasing the onboard processing demands or the data downlink volume.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","startPage":"196","endPage":"199","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325733.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CEBRAS: Cross elevation beam range ambiguity suppression for high-resolution wide-swath and MIMO-SAR imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7325733/","displayDocTitle":"CEBRAS: Cross elevation beam range ambiguity suppression for high-resolution wide-swath and MIMO-SAR imaging","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15599599","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CEBRAS: Cross elevation beam range ambiguity suppression for high-resolution wide-swath and MIMO-SAR imaging","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0000196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097933S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7325734,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Rincon","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Rincon","id":"37265720200"},{"name":"Temilola Fatoyinbo","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD"],"firstName":"Temilola","lastName":"Fatoyinbo","id":"37888681800"},{"name":"SeungKuk Lee","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD"],"firstName":"SeungKuk","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407208900"},{"name":"Batuhan Osmanoglu","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD","Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, MD"],"firstName":"Batuhan","lastName":"Osmanoglu","id":"37085460718"},{"name":"Jon Ranson","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Ranson","id":"38500334800"},{"name":"Guoqing Sun","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenblet, MD","University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085470550"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7325734","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Array signal processing","Radar antennas","Antenna measurements","Extraterrestrial measurements","Radar measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","geophysical techniques","interferometry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital Beamforming Synthetic Aperture Radar","single-pass interferometry","forest structure estimation","DBSAR","conventional radar systems","SAR systems","single radar platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Beamforming","SAR","InSAR"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital beamforming synthetic aperture radar (DBSAR): Single-pass interferometry for forest structure estimation","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325734","startPage":"200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325734","abstract":"Digital Beamforming permits the implementation of non-conventional measurement techniques, which can overcome fundamental limitations of conventional radar systems.

The statistical analysis based on bivariate distribution data organized into different intervals of magnitude can be an important tool to further understand the properties of the backscattered signal, which can be a valuable premise for change detection processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Statistical analysis","Clutter","Histograms","Manganese","Standards","Backscatter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","radar clutter","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar","statistical analysis","synthetic aperture radar","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical-statistical analysis","amplitude SAR image data","change detection algorithm","prefiltered clutter VHF SAR image analysis","image-pair magnitude sample","SAR clutter","bivariate distribution data","backscattered signal","change detection processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-frequency SAR","clutter distribution","CDA","statistical analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325776","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325776.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical-statistical analysis of amplitude SAR images for change detection algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Empirical-statistical analysis of amplitude SAR images for change detection algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325776/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325776/","accessionNumber":"15599784","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical-statistical analysis of amplitude SAR images for change detection algorithms","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0000365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05813S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7325779,"authors":[{"name":"G.

promising band selection algorithm, known as particle swarm optimization/impurity function class overlapping (PSO/IFCO) method, which adopts a novel multiple attribute decision making (MADM) model approach to the hyperspectral remote sensing images. The proposed MADM-based PSO/IFCO method can be divided into two steps: 1) PSO algorithm and 2) the IFCO scheme. With PSO band selection algorithm, the highly correlated bands of hyperspectral imagery can first be grouped into band modules, known as greedy modular eigenspace (GME), to coarsely reduce high-dimensional datasets in the first step. The more highly correlated small modules are further constructed with the statistics of impurity weights calculated by IFCO scheme in the second step. These statistics results of impurity weights are used to finely select the most important feature bands from the hyperspectral imagery. The proposed MADM-based PSO/IFCO makes use of the correlation coefficients matrix to cluster the highly correlated bands together and obtain GME in the first step. More specifically, we use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model, which is the most suitable implementation of MCDM for proposed method, to examine hierarchically the relations among different GME modules with the impurity weighted by IFCO in the second step. Finally, by accommodating the statistics of impurity weights, the proposed MADM-based PSO/IFCO method can effectively select the most representative features for hyperspectral band selection and reduction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by MASTER and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the high dimension reduction rate, but also offer a satisfactory classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325795","startPage":"441","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325795.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization/impurity function class overlapping scheme based on multiple attribute decision making model for hyperspectral band selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325795/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization/impurity function class overlapping scheme based on multiple attribute decision making model for hyperspectral band selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325795/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15599959","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization/impurity function class overlapping scheme based on multiple attribute decision making model for hyperspectral band selection","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0000441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105819S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7325813,"authors":[{"name":"Yonglong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yonglong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085616289"},{"name":"Zebin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zebin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37597234500"},{"name":"Jie Wei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085619390"},{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Plaza","id":"37085388867"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"38323572200"},{"name":"Zhihui Wei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Wei","id":"37362324700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7325813","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast principal component analysis for hyperspectral imaging based on cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Principal component analysis","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Cloud computing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","geophysics computing","principal component analysis","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","hyperspectral imaging","cloud computing architecture","hyperspectral remote sensing image","PCA algorithm","Apache Hadoop model","MapReduce model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Principal component analysis","hyperspectral remote sensing","Hadoop","distributed parallel optimization"]}],"abstract":"Principal component analysis (PCA) is an important method for feature extraction of hyperspectral remote sensing image.

The proposed implementation exploits the GPU architecture at low level, thus taking full advantage of the computational power of GPUs using shared memory and coalesced accesses to memory. The proposed algorithm is evaluated not only in terms of reconstruction error but also in terms of computational performance using two different GPU architectures by NVIDIA: GeForce GTX 590 and GeForce GTX TITAN. Experimental results using real data reveals signficant speedups up with regards to serial implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU implementation of a hyperspectral coded aperture algorithm for compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325815","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325815.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"GPU implementation of a hyperspectral coded aperture algorithm for compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325815/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15588902","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU implementation of a hyperspectral coded aperture algorithm for compressive sensing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0000521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072193S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325816,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqing Zhou","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085424007"},{"name":"Na Liu","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085659466"},{"name":"Chenyang Li","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, CN"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085680241"},{"name":"Linjun Jiang","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Linjun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085676609"},{"name":"Yue Sun","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085417023"},{"name":"Mingyan Li","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085668425"},{"name":"RongTing Zhang","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"RongTing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085674636"},{"name":"Tao Yue","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory for Spatial Information and Geomatics, University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085410166"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7325816","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering algorithms","Filtering","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Remote sensing","Real-time systems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","geophysical image processing","image denoising","median filters","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based remotely sensed imagery denoising","field programmable gate array","FPGA-based median filtering","FPGA hardware","hardware components","software platform","ENVI version 4.8 software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","noise","median filter","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)-based remotely sensed imagery denoising method, named FPGA-based median filtering.

However, since every country prepare data inhomogeneously, the implementation of the crop model in all regions is difficult. Deep learning is possible to extract important features for estimating the object from the input data, so it can be expected to reduce dependency of input data.

Contrarily to the conventional compression schemes, which first acquire the full data set and then implement some compressing technique, compressive sensing (CS) acquires directly the compressed signal which will be later recovered on the ground station. The CS paradigm fits perfectly the requirements of onborad hyperspectral imaging systems in terms of energy, computing power, and bandwidth. By using CS in these systems, the amount of data acquired and transmitted to the ground stations is reduced and the bulk of the computation to infer the original data is carried out in the ground stations. In this paper, we present a new technique to perform CS of hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exploit the fact that HSIs admits a low dimensional linear representation. The proposed method is blind in the sense that linear representation is learned with low computational cost from the compressed measurements. Furthermore the proposed method is very light from the computational point of view and it can recover perfectly the original image in noise-free scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in both synthetic and real scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07325937.pdf","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1003","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7325937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral compressive sensing from spectral projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Signal to noise ratio","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Image coding","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral compressive sensing","spectral projections","hyperspectral data compression","ground station","CS paradigm","hyperspectral images CS","linear representation","noise-free scenarios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Compressive sensing","Random projections","Linear spectral unmixing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7325937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral compressive sensing from spectral projections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7325937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15588822","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral compressive sensing from spectral projections","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0001000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047907S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7325937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7325951,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The large spectral variability imposes the use of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis techniques, in which many possible mixture models are considered to produce the best fit. The use of many endmembers and mixture models result in prohibitive computational time. In this study, an artificial neural network is used to inverse the pixel spectral mixture in Landsat imagery.

Kernel RX algorithm is not new but a real-time procedure of KRX has not been explored in the past. The need of real-time processing arises from the fact that many targets especially moving targets, must be detected on a timely basis. This paper presents a real-time anomaly detection algorithm based on KRX, named as real-time causal kernel RX detector (RTCKRXD) by which hyperspectral image data can be processed timely. Experimental results demonstrate the new real-time version of KRX significantly solves real-time processing problem compared to conventional KRX anomaly detector with a comparable detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326156","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel subspace-based real-time anomaly detection for hyperspectral imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kernel subspace-based real-time anomaly detection for hyperspectral imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326156/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15588968","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7326156/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel subspace-based real-time anomaly detection for hyperspectral imagery","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0001865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04252S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326158,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method consists of three stages: (i) Detection of potential objects, (ii) feature extraction and (iii) classification of potential objects. The first stage is application dependent, with the aim of detecting all seal pups in the image, with the expense of detecting a large amount of false objects. The second stage extracts generic image features from a local image corresponding to each potential seal detected in the first stage using a CNN trained on the ImageNet database. In the third stage we apply a linear support vector machine to classify the feature vectors extracted in the second stage. The proposed method was demonstrated to an aerial image that contains 84 pups and 128 adult harp seals, and the results show that we are able to detect the seals with high accuracy (2.7% for the adults and 7.3% for the pups). We conclude that deep CNNs trained on the ImageNet database are well suited as a feature extraction module, and using a simple linear SVM, we were able to separate seals from other objects with very high accuracy. We believe that this methodology may be applied to other remote sensing object recognition tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15599637","htmlLink":"/document/7326163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of seals in remote sensing images using features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of seals in remote sensing images using features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0001893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042651S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326271,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Taravat","affiliation":["Remote Sensing & Environmental Modelling Lab, Christian Albrechts University, Germany"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Taravat","id":"37085419818"},{"name":"Simone Peronaci","affiliation":["Dept. of Civil Engineering and Computer Science, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Peronaci","id":"37085615026"},{"name":"Massimilliano Sist","affiliation":["Dept. of Civil Engineering and Computer Science, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimilliano","lastName":"Sist","id":"37085625931"},{"name":"Fabio Del Frate","affiliation":["Dept. of Civil Engineering and Computer Science, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Del Frate","id":"37269662900"},{"name":"Natascha Oppelt","affiliation":["Remote Sensing & Environmental Modelling Lab, Christian Albrechts University, Germany"],"firstName":"Natascha","lastName":"Oppelt","id":"37372435300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326271","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Satellites","Earth","Neural networks","Clouds","Classification algorithms","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","clouds","geophysical image processing","image segmentation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band ratioing techniques","neural networks algorithms","MSG SEVIRI masking","Landsat ETM+ cloud masking data","clouds","segmented subimage","MLP neural network technique","Landsat ETM+ subimages","Gulf-of-Mexico","MSG SEVIRI image data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clouds","Neural Networks","MSG SEVIRI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326271","abstract":"In this paper a new approach from the combination of band ratioing function and MLP Neural Networks technique is proposed to differentiate between clouds and background in Landsat ETM+ and MSG SEVIRI data.

In this work, we discuss an innovative and fast motion compensation procedure that is based on the estimation of two Doppler key Parameters: the Doppler Centroid and the Doppler Rate, which are related to the target motion parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on real data acquired by a static Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar with an azimuth wide beamwidth; the radar is installed near the inner harbor of La Spezia (Italy) and it owned to the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (CMRE-NATO).","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326304","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","startPage":"2445","endPage":"2448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAR motion compensation based on a new Doppler parameters estimation procedure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ISAR motion compensation based on a new Doppler parameters estimation procedure","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326304/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15599978","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7326304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAR motion compensation based on a new Doppler parameters estimation procedure","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0002445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048287S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326389,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Rincon","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Rincon","id":"37265720200"},{"name":"Temilola Fatoyinbo","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, US"],"firstName":"Temilola","lastName":"Fatoyinbo"},{"name":"Batuhan Osmanoglu","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD","Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, MD"],"firstName":"Batuhan","lastName":"Osmanoglu","id":"37085460718"},{"name":"Seung-Kuk Lee","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD"],"firstName":"Seung-Kuk","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407208900"},{"name":"K.

This is very interesting in hyperspectral applications due to the large amount of data that the hyper-spectral sensors collect, store and transmit to the ground stations. Over the last years many compressive sensing methods have been applied to hyperspectral images, and others have been proposed for exploiting the unique features of this kind of images. Over the last years, many techniques have been proposed to perform compressive sensing in hyperspectral imaging. One of them is the Hyperspectral Coded Aperture (HYCA), which exploits two characteristics of hyper-spectral imagery: 1) the hyperspectral vectors belong to a low dimensional subspace, and 2) the data cube components exhibit very high correlation in the spatial and in the spectral domains. However, HYCA requires the knowledge of the subspace in advance, which, very often, may compromise its applicability. In this paper it is presented a new technique similar to HYCA which does not require the knowledge of the subspace in advance; the proposed technique is termed blind HYCA (B-HYCA) and it performs a form of blind hyperspectral compressed sensing.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326410","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326410.pdf","startPage":"2856","endPage":"2859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"B-HYCA: Blind hyperspectral compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326410/","displayDocTitle":"B-HYCA: Blind hyperspectral compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15599331","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326410/","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"B-HYCA: Blind hyperspectral compressive sensing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0002856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053338S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326432,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Merentitis","affiliation":["AGT International, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Merentitis","id":"37294680300"},{"name":"Christian Debes","affiliation":["AGT International, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Debes","id":"37547122800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326432","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"abstract":"Fusion of different sensor modalities has proven very effective in numerous remote sensing applications.

This document hence describes a new algorithm for improving the detection of a potential moving target when a Ground Based (GB) MIMO SAR is adopted. GB-MIMO SAR is a new family of radar sensors which are able to create a 2-D image of a scene of interest without a moving platform. In order to improve the detection ability of the system, especially when SCR is low, a novel signal processing approach is presented, based on the Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) architecture. Since a GB-MIMO SAR image is obtained by acquiring data from several channels, it is possible to increase the SCR by adding them coherently and adopting a Single Delay-Line Canceler (SDLC). The results proved the ability of the proposed method for increasing the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio, especially for stationary or quasi-stationary clutter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

The results show that using this new technique improves precision and recall values while the global anomaly method prevents the unwanted known objects to be detected as anomaly.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326576","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326576.pdf","startPage":"3505","endPage":"3508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of unwanted anomalies in a hyperspectral image using modified subspace RX algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326576/","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of unwanted anomalies in a hyperspectral image using modified subspace RX algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15588951","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326576/","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of unwanted anomalies in a hyperspectral image using modified subspace RX algorithm","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0003505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049177S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326597,"authors":[{"name":"Yanmei Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Earthquake Science, China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Yanmei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37558979900"},{"name":"Zaisen Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Earthquake Science, China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Zaisen","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37899149000"},{"name":"Ying Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Earthquake Science, China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085369711"},{"name":"Haiying Huang","affiliation":["Hubei Station for Surveying and Mapping Product Quality Supervision and Inspection, Wuhan, Hubei, CHINA"],"firstName":"Haiying","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085355862"},{"name":"Xiao Cheng","affiliation":["College of Global Change and Earth system Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37553770400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326597","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earthquakes","Land surface temperature","MODIS","Remote sensing","Satellites","Land surface","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthquakes","land surface temperature","remote sensing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal anomaly detection","Jinggu earthquake","remote sensing data","MODIS land surface temperature product time series","Yunnan province","China","MOD11A2 product","AD 2001 to 2013","AD 2014 08 to 2014 12","differential images","LST change detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal anomalies","land surface temperature","Jinggu earthquake","MODIS"]}],"abstract":"Thermal anomaly appears to be a significant precursor of some strong earthquakes. In this study, time series of daily MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) product are processed and analyzed to detect possible anomalies prior the Jinggu earthquake (7 October 2014, Yunnan Province). In order to reduce the seasonal or annual effects from the LST variations, also to avoid the rainy and cloudy weather in this area, a background data of 10-day LST are derived using averaging MOD11A2 products from 2001 to 2013. Then the 10-day LST data from August 2014 to December 2014 were differenced using the above background. RX anomaly detection algorithm was applied to detect the anomalies. Abnormal LST increase before the earthquake is quite obvious from the differential images, indicating that this method is useful in such area with high mountains and cloudy weather.

Advances in SAR technology and deployment of new SAR satellites have contributed to an increasing number of remote sensing data available. Handle this large amount of data with human operators is infeasible. Therefore, the use of automated tools to process remote sensing images, identify regions of interest, and select relevant information are needed. The use of neural networks to solve SAR image classification problems is well known. A typical architecture consists of a shallow feed-forward neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. This type of neural network, combined with back-propagation and a gradient-based training algorithm, is able to solve complex problems in SAR image analysis. However, this architecture is unable to take advantage of unlabeled data during its training process, and in many cases the input features need to be carefully tuned in order to reduce the overall network complexity.

In [1], a concept for change analysis in urban areas was proposed. The main part of this concept is the categorization of detected changes. Aiming on the changes itself, it can be distinguished between objects, which are static at the time of image acquisition and objects, which are in motion. In SAR image analysis, the detection of moving objects is commonly known as Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI). For two-channel SAR systems like TerraSAR-X (TSX), a traditional method is Along-Track Interferometry (ATI). In our method [1], changes caused by static objects have been investigated using repeat-pass SAR imagery with a time gap of at least 11 days. This dataset excludes the application of ATI. Furthermore, ATI is only capable of detecting moving objects with motion in across-track direction [5]. In this paper, a GIS based detection scheme is proposed, which considers objects moving in along-track as well as in across-track direction at the time of image acquisition.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326735","startPage":"4133","endPage":"4136","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GIS based ground moving target indication in time series of SAR amplitude images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"GIS based ground moving target indication in time series of SAR amplitude images","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326735/","accessionNumber":"15588746","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326735/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GIS based ground moving target indication in time series of SAR amplitude images","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0004133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038254S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7326745,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Lagrange","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Lagrange","id":"37085734857"},{"name":"Bertrand Le Saux","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Le Saux","id":"37326249900"},{"name":"Anne Beaup\u00e8re","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Beaup\u00e8re","id":"37085726926"},{"name":"Alexandre Boulch","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Boulch","id":"37085558454"},{"name":"Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Chan-Hon-Tong","id":"37085730794"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Herbin","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Herbin","id":"37271095500"},{"name":"Hicham Randrianarivo","affiliation":["Onera - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Randrianarivo","id":"37085590825"},{"name":"Marin Ferecatu","affiliation":["CNAM - Cedric, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marin","lastName":"Ferecatu","id":"37297365400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326745","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":705},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Semantics","Laser radar","Neural networks","Remote sensing","Buildings","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","neural nets","support vector machines","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic labeling","multisource earth-observation data benchmarking classification","expert classifiers","spectral support-vector classification","high-level features","deep neural networks","multisensor features","image domain","deep convolutional networks","generic-purpose image sets","learning explicit features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote sensing","Image classification","Pattern analysis","Neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326745","abstract":"In this paper, we address the task of semantic labeling of multisource earth-observation (EO) data.

The experiment results are illustrated with practical examples and verify the efficacy of this algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326805","startPage":"4412","endPage":"4415","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shadow removal in remote sensing images using features sample matting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Shadow removal in remote sensing images using features sample matting","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326805/","accessionNumber":"15588851","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326805/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shadow removal in remote sensing images using features sample matting","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0004412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041932S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7326813,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["NJUST, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085405293"},{"name":"Zebin Wu","affiliation":["NJUST, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zebin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37597234500"},{"name":"Zhihui Wei","affiliation":["NJUST, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Wei","id":"37362324700"},{"name":"Hongyi Liu","affiliation":["NJUST, School of Science, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085347961"},{"name":"Xiong Xu","affiliation":["College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics, Tongji University, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Xu","id":"38506307000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326813","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Dictionaries","Detectors","Yttrium","Object detection","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","image processing","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-rank representation sum-to-one method","sum-to-one constraint","low-rank representation model","low rank representation","hyperspectral image anomaly detection method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","hyperspectral image","low rank representation","sum-to-one"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral image(HSI) based on low-rank representation. In the observed HSI, the anomalies can be separated from the background. Since each pixel in the background can be approximately represented by a background dictionary, and the representation coefficients of the background pixels are correlative, a low-rank representation model is used to model the background part. Besides, to gain robust representation coefficient, the sum-to-one constraint is added. The advantage of the proposed low-rank representation sum-to-one (LRRSTO) method is that it makes use of the global correlation of the background and strength the robustness of the representation. Experiments results have been conducted using both simulated and real data sets. These experiments indicated that our algorithm achieves very promising performance.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326813","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326813.pdf","startPage":"4444","endPage":"4447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel hyperspectral image anomaly detection method based on low rank representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326813/","displayDocTitle":"A novel hyperspectral image anomaly detection method based on low rank representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15615174","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326813/","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hyperspectral image anomaly detection method based on low rank representation","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0004444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075718S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7326816,"authors":[{"name":"Yubin Niu","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yubin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085542347"},{"name":"Zhao Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085380844"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37559493800"},{"name":"Wei Xia","affiliation":["China Transport Telecommunications & Information Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xia","id":"37586914000"},{"name":"Jian Qiu Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian Qiu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37351707200"},{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37275649000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326816","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Object detection","Contamination","Hyperspectral imaging","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","object detection","optimisation","remote sensing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-window background dictionary","dual-window method","sparse target detection","convex optimization","sparse dictionary","hyperspectral imagery","sparse representation","learned dictionary","hyperspectral target detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral imagery","target detection","learned dictionary","sparse representation","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"Sparse representation has been introduced to tackle the target detection problem in hyperspectral imagery.

To solve this problem, we construct a backprojection based imaging operator, and introduce it to the complex approximate message passing algorithm (CAMP). The new image formation algorithm is called BP-CAMP in this paper. Compared with the approximated observation methods deduced from the FFT-based imaging technology, BP-CAMP is not limited by observation models of the radar and motion modes of the platform, and it therefore possesses universal applicability. By the simulations and real data processing, the experimental results show that BP-CAMP has lower computational complexity and memory cost than CAMP, and also achieves SAR imaging with under-sampled echo data.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326822","startPage":"4480","endPage":"4483","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07326822.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of BP-camp algorithm for SAR imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A study of BP-camp algorithm for SAR imaging","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7326822/","accessionNumber":"15588927","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326822/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of BP-camp algorithm for SAR imaging","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0004480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044933S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7326847,"authors":[{"name":"Qiao Zou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.

Results show that Wavelet Denoising (WD), and Multiresolution Fourier Transform (MFT) are the best techniques in most scenarios, specially for GNSS-based instruments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7326890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15599927","htmlLink":"/document/7326890/","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of back-end RFI mitigation techniques in passive remote sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of back-end RFI mitigation techniques in passive remote sensing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0004746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064804S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7326890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7326936,"authors":[{"name":"Shin'ichi Sakai","affiliation":["Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Sakai","id":"38203122500"},{"name":"Masafumi Matsuyama","affiliation":["Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Matsuyama","id":"37694113900"},{"name":"Kouzou Okuda","affiliation":["Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouzou","lastName":"Okuda","id":"37085643226"},{"name":"Fumihiro Uehara","affiliation":["Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumihiro","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37085637095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7326936","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"After 2011 Tohoku-Pacific Ocean earthquake, Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. has been voluntary addressing to build the tsunami observation network at Hamaoka nuclear power station mainly utilizing an ocean radar, the GPS-mounted Buoy, the submarine cabled real-time seafloor observatory system and a highly sensitive camera. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basic usability of the VHF ocean radar through field observation in front of Hamaoka nuclear P/S, and to investigate short time variability of coastal currents under the natural condition for construction of tsunami warning system. High acquisition area of valid current data of the ocean radar varied from 13 to 17 km off the observation site in the radial direction, which suggests the maximum detection range of tsunami by the ocean radar in this sea area. The comparison of the current data by the ocean radar with the current meter resulted in the correlation coefficient of about 0.8 in radial direction, and the correlation improved after reducing the wind-driven effect by the multiple regression analysis with the wind data. As the temporal variability of coastal currents to 1-hour interval was almost about 5 to 10 cm/s, the current anomaly excited by tsunami greater than 10 cm/s seems to be detectable by the ocean radar in this area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium

can be consider as a classification task. Most of the existing studies and research efforts are following the conventional pattern recognition paradigm, which is based on the construction of complex handcrafted features. However, it is rarely known which features are important for the problem at hand. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a deep learning based classification method that hierarchically constructs high-level features in an automated way. Our method exploits a Convolutional Neural Network to encode pixels' spectral and spatial information and a Multi-Layer Perceptron to conduct the classification task.

The accuracy of both classifiers varied with the amount and nature of mis-labeled training cases. In particular, the SVM, which has been claimed to be relatively insensitive to training data error, showed the greatest sensitivity with overall accuracy declining by 8% with the use of a training set containing 20% mis-labeled cases; the difference in accuracy from that obtained without mis-labeled cases was statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence.

First, the full spectrum is divided into several contiguous band groups for dimensionality reduction as well as for exploiting the peculiarities of different parts of the spectrum. Then, sparse spectral unmixing is performed for identifying significant endmembers in the scene, and hierarchical clustering in the abundance space is used for identifying pixel groups that contain these endmembers. Next, these pixel groups are used for initializing individual Gaussian mixture models that are estimated separately for each spectral band group. Finally, the Gaussian mixture models for all groups are fused for obtaining the final anomaly map for the scene.

The effective exploitation of this large amount of data requires both adequate computing resources as well as advanced algorithms able to properly exploit such facilities. In this work we discuss the migration of the DInSAR technique referred to as Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS), which is used for Earth's surface deformation investigation, to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public Cloud Computing environment. An experimental analysis aimed at evaluating the P-SBAS scalable performances that are achieved within the Cloud environment is presented. The achieved results show very good parallel performances and allow us to identify the major bottlenecks that can hamper such behavior when the amount of data to process highly increases. Accordingly, we present an advanced P-SBAS implementation that is designed to overcome the identified bottlenecks. The experimental analysis is carried out by processing both Envisat and COSMO-SkyMed datasets and by exploiting both a High Performance Computing cluster as well as AWS public Cloud.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7327022","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303999/7325670/07327022.pdf","startPage":"5264","endPage":"5267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7327022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7325670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New advances in intensive DInSAR processing through cloud computing environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327022/","displayDocTitle":"New advances in intensive DInSAR processing through cloud computing environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15599906","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7327022/","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New advances in intensive DInSAR processing through cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"0005264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083529S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303999","isNumber":"7325670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303999","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7325670","articleId":"7327022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7327023,"authors":[{"name":"Marion Heublein","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","Institute of Photo grammetry and Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Heublein","id":"37085617384"},{"name":"Xiao Xiang Zhu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","Chair of Remote Sensing Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiao Xiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37404573000"},{"name":"Fadwa Alshawaf","affiliation":["Institute of Photo grammetry and Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Fadwa","lastName":"Alshawaf","id":"38501079100"},{"name":"Michael Mayer","affiliation":["Geodetic Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mayer","id":"38510590700"},{"name":"Richard Bamler","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","Chair of Remote Sensing Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bamler","id":"37078802200"},{"name":"Stefan Hinz","affiliation":["Institute of Photo grammetry and Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hinz","id":"37268918000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7929-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7928-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7327023","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Delays","Three-dimensional displays","Tomography","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Meteorology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric precipitation","tomography","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traditional Tikhonov regularization","sophisticated CS estimation","cosine transform","Weather Research and Forecasting modeling system","precipitable water vapor input data","Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","3D neutrospheric water vapor tomographic reconstruction","innovative compressive sensing","GNSS observation","InSAR observation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","tomographic reconstruction","Compressive Sensing","GNSS","InSAR"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the innovative Compressive Sensing (CS) concept for tomographic reconstruction of 3D neutrospheric water vapor fields using data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR).

The presented technique is introduced as an alternative to the traditional focusing methods, suggesting new modes for data acquisition in a more efficient configurations or on-board processing in case of spaceborne sensors. In this paper the method is tested on both simulated and real images acquired by a Ground Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR), for which images of reduced size can be generated with no difficulty. Results of comparison of CS processing with an exact focusing algorithm are shown in terms of root mean square error of amplitude and phase as a function of the number of focused targets and undersampling of the acquisition lines. Coherence of a CS-processed couple of images is also evaluated. The purpose of the paper is to show the potential of CS applied to SAR systems, regardless (at the moment) of the efficiency in computational load. In particular, we show that the image can be reconstructed without loss of resolution after dropping a fair percentage of the received pulses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focusing SAR images by

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of wireless charging techniques, the developments in technical standards, and their recent advances in network applications. In particular, with regard to network applications, we review the static charger scheduling strategies, mobile charger dispatch strategies and wireless charger deployment strategies. Additionally, we discuss open issues and challenges in implementing wireless charging technologies.

Based on a measurement campaign and considering a sum power constraint, achievable data rates for amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are analyzed. Similar investigations are performed for the maximum data rates attained using Hermitian-symmetric orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (HS-OFDM) together with equal gain combining (EGC), selection combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques. The influences of optimally and uniformly allocated transmission power and frequency bandwidth are are also analyzed and the efficiency of combination before and after equalization is compared. Results show that the relative distances among source, relay and destination nodes significantly impact system performance. Also, they reveal a range of total transmission power and bandwidth in which benefits can be verified. Among combining techniques, MRC and SC present similar results, but MRC offers a slightly better performance. In relation to computational complexity, SC is the most favorable. Maximum data rate analyses of HS-OFDM with frequency domain equalization based on zero forcing and minimum mean square error criteria show that the former scheme offers almost the same performance as the latter. Furthermore, it is shown that equalization after combination is more advantageous.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2499744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07327147.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2499744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","startPage":"778","endPage":"789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative In-Home Power Line Communication: Analyses Based on a Measurement Campaign","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative In-Home Power Line Communication: Analyses Based on a Measurement Campaign","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786051","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7327147/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CNPq, CAPES, FAPEMIG, FINEP, P&D ANEEL-CEMIG, INERGE, Smarti9 Ltda."},{"fundingName":"Fulbright Commission for their financial support"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative In-Home Power Line Communication: Analyses Based on a Measurement Campaign","sourcePdf":"tcomm-facina-2499744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092056S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7327147","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7327166,"authors":[{"name":"Spiros Mikroulis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Spiros","lastName":"Mikroulis","id":"37085611572"},{"name":"Manoj P.

In our schemes, heavy computations are outsourced to Encryption Service Providers (ESPs) or Decryption Service Providers (DSPs), leaving only one modular exponentiation computation for the sender or the receiver. Moreover, we propose a general verification mechanism for a wide class of ciphertext-policy (cf. key-policy) AB-KEM schemes, which can check the correctness of the outsourced encryption and decryption efficiently. Concretely, we introduce a stronger version of verifiability (cf.\u00a0\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n ) and a new security notion for outsourced decryption called exculpability, which guarantees that a user cannot accuse DSP of returning incorrect results while it is not the case. With all these mechanisms, any dispute between a user and an outsource computation service provider can be easily resolved, furthermore, a service provider will be less motivated to give out wrong results.

The core idea is to decompose the target image into fully overlapping patches, restore each of them separately, and then merge the results by a plain averaging. This concept has been demonstrated to be highly effective, leading often times to the state-of-the-art results in denoising, inpainting, deblurring, segmentation, and other applications. While the above is indeed effective, this approach has one major flaw: the prior is imposed on intermediate (patch) results, rather than on the final outcome, and this is typically manifested by visual artifacts. The expected patch log likelihood (EPLL) method by Zoran and Weiss was conceived for addressing this very problem. Their algorithm imposes the prior on the patches of the final image, which in turn leads to an iterative restoration of diminishing effect. In this paper, we propose to further extend and improve the EPLL by considering a multi-scale prior. Our algorithm imposes the very same prior on different scale patches extracted from the target image. While all the treated patches are of the same size, their footprint in the destination image varies due to subsampling. Our scheme comes to alleviate another shortcoming existing in patch-based restoration algorithms-the fact that a local (patch-based) prior is serving as a model for a global stochastic phenomenon. We motivate the use of the multi-scale EPLL by restricting ourselves to the simple Gaussian case, comparing the aforementioned algorithms and showing a clear advantage to the proposed method. We then demonstrate our algorithm in the context of image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, showing an improvement in performance both visually and quantitatively.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2499698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2499698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7331739/07327182.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.398b0c33-c96c-462c-83c7-3450ffeb2455","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2016/11/23/multi-scale-patch-based-image-restoration-super-resolution","name":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration - Super Resolution","language":"Octave","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=398b0c33-c96c-462c-83c7-3450ffeb2455","badgeType":"Code-Available"},{"doi":"10.24433/CO.a11086e8-10f7-412f-9127-75b7558ce951","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2016/11/23/multi-scale-patch-based-image-restoration-deblurring","name":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration - Deblurring","language":"Octave","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=a11086e8-10f7-412f-9127-75b7558ce951","badgeType":"Code-Available"},{"doi":"10.24433/CO.a721fc31-c90d-4e41-a788-5c4187af86af","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2016/11/23/multi-scale-patch-based-image-restoration-denoising","name":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration - Denoising","language":"Octave","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=a721fc31-c90d-4e41-a788-5c4187af86af","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration","volume":"25","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7327182/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15645931","pubMedId":"26571527","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327182/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council through the European Unions Seventh Framework Program","grantNumber":"320649"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Scale Patch-Based Image Restoration","sourcePdf":"tip-papyan-2499698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082451S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7331739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"7331739","articleId":"7327182","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7327186,"authors":[{"name":"Deepti Ghadiyaram","affiliation":["Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7331739/7327186/ghadi-2500021-small.gif","p":["Deepti Ghadiyaram received the B.Tech. degree in computer science from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, in 2009, and the M.S. degree from The University of Texas at Austin, in 2013.

However, images captured using typical real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment, resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image analysis databases. Toward overcoming these limitations, we designed and created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative variety of modern mobile devices. We also designed and implemented a new online crowdsourcing system, which we have used to conduct a very large-scale, multi-month image quality assessment (IQA) subjective study. Our database consists of over 350 000 opinion scores on 1162 images evaluated by over 8100 unique human observers. Despite the lack of control over the experimental environments of the numerous study participants, we demonstrate excellent internal consistency of the subjective data set. We also evaluate several top-performing blind IQA algorithms on it and present insights on how the mixtures of distortions challenge both end users as well as automatic perceptual quality prediction models.

In order to extract the effective features, wavelet kernel local fisher discriminant analysis (WKLFDA) is first proposed; herein, a new wavelet kernel function is proposed to construct the kernel function of LFDA. In order to automatically select the parameters of WKLFDA, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed, yielding a new PSO-WKLFDA. When compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed PSO-WKLFDA yields better performance. However, the use of a single global transformation of PSO-WKLFDA for the multiclass task does not provide excellent classification accuracy due to the fact that the projected data still significantly overlap with each other in the projected subspace. In order to enhance the performance of bearing defect classification, a novel method is then proposed by transforming the multiclass task into all possible binary classification tasks using a one-against-one (OAO) strategy. Then, individual PSO-WKLFDA (I-PSO-WKLFDA) is used for extracting effective features of each binary class. The extracted effective features of each binary class are input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, a decision fusion mechanism is employed to merge the classification results from each SVM classifier to identify the bearing condition. Simulation results using synthetic data and experimental results using different bearing fault types show that the proposed method is well suited and effective for bearing defect classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755391","htmlLink":"/document/7327187/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bearing Defect Classification Based on Individual Wavelet Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis with Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing Defect Classification Based on Individual Wavelet Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis with Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tii-heejun-2500098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074803S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7327187","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7327192,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In such context, the goal is to optimize the Quality of Service (QoS) and cost objectives for the cloud-based services. However, the difficulty lies in the facts that these objectives, e.g., throughput and cost, can be naturally conflicted; and the QoS of cloud-based services often interfere due to the shared infrastructure in cloud. Consequently, dynamic and effective trade-off decision making of autoscaling in the cloud is necessary, yet challenging. In particular, it is even harder to achieve well-compromised trade-offs, where the decision largely improves the majority of the objectives; while causing relatively small degradations to others. In this paper, we present a self-adaptive decision making approach for autoscaling in the cloud. It is capable to adaptively produce autoscaling decisions that lead to well-compromised trade-offs without heavy human intervention. We leverage on ant colony inspired multi-objective optimization for searching and optimizing the trade-offs decisions, the result is then filtered by compromise-dominance, a mechanism that extracts the decisions with balanced improvements in the trade-offs. We experimentally compare our approach to four state-of-the-arts autoscaling approaches: rule, heuristic, randomized and multi-objective genetic algorithm based solutions. The results reveal the effectiveness of our approach over the others, including better quality of trade-offs and significantly smaller violation of the requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327204/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7327204/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17136244","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Self-Adaptive Trade-off Decision Making for Autoscaling Cloud-Based Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Adaptive Trade-off Decision Making for Autoscaling Cloud-Based Services","sourcePdf":"tsc-chen-2499770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099646S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8002778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8002778","articleId":"7327204","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7327207,"authors":[{"name":"Nanxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Honda Research Institute, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7442200/7327207/li-2493451-small.gif","p":["\n\nNanxiang Li (S'12) received the B.S. degree from Xiamen University, \nXiamen, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree from the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA, in 2009, and the Ph.D. \ndegree from the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA, in 2015, all in electrical engineering.

Checking the mirrors is an important primary driving action that allows drivers to maintain their situational awareness, particularly when they are planning to turn or change lanes. Recognizing when drivers are checking the mirrors can facilitate the detection of hazard scenarios by considering contextual information (e.g., turning without checking mirrors, lack of mirror-checking actions signaling cognitive distractions, or distinction between gazes due to primary or secondary tasks). This study analyzes drivers' mirror-checking actions under various real driving conditions. We analyze the drivers' mirror-checking actions under normal conditions, as well as when the drivers are engaged in secondary tasks such as tuning the radio or operating a cell phone. We also compare mirror-checking behaviors observed during different maneuver actions: driving straight, turning, and switching lanes. This study reveals statistically significant differences in mirror-checking actions among most of the comparisons. The results suggest that mirror-checking actions can be useful indicators in recognizing drivers engaged in secondary tasks, as well as in detecting driving maneuvers. We propose to detect mirror-checking actions using features extracted from multiple noninvasive sensors (CAN-Bus and cameras facing the driver and the road). We consider three machine learning algorithms for unbalanced data sets, achieving an F-score of 91%. The recognized mirror-checking actions are used as additional features to improve the performance of secondary task detection and maneuver recognition. These promising results suggest that it is possible to detect mirror-checking actions, providing contextual information to improve new driver monitoring systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7442200/07327207.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2493451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2493451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Drivers' Mirror-Checking Actions and Its Application to Maneuver and Secondary Task Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Feature extraction","Roads","Mirrors","Sensors","Turning","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","controller area networks","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple noninvasive sensors","switching lanes","driving straight","cognitive distractions","mirror checking actions","contextual information","change lanes","primary driving action","secondary task recognition","detecting driver mirror checking actions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver distraction","driving maneuver","mirror-checking detection","binary classification","imbalanced classification"]},{"kwd":["Driver distraction","driving maneuver","mirror-checking detection","binary classification","imbalanced classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Drivers' Mirror-Checking Actions and Its Application to Maneuver and Secondary Task Recognition","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7327207/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874649","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Drivers' Mirror-Checking Actions and Its Application to Maneuver and Secondary Task Recognition","sourcePdf":"tits-busso-2493451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103346S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7442200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7442200","articleId":"7327207","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7327210,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7440769/7327210/chen-small.gif","p":["Wei Chen (M\u201912) was born in Shanxi, China, in 1977.

The modulation index m is segmented in linear modulation region reasonably, and the switching sequences are designed at each segmentation independently. The sequences for two reference vector distribution modes are designed, respectively, which ensure the synchronization and symmetry in output waveforms and the minimization of switching frequency. Then, the optimal sequence at each segmentation is selected from the two sequences (corresponding to the two modes) in terms of the weighted total harmonic distortion (THD) of line voltage. The proposed strategy is verified through simulation and experiment on a constant v/f open-loop induction motor drive, and the results show that both line voltage weighted THD and no-load stator current THD can be significantly reduced compared to conventional SSVPWM (CSSVPWM) and space-vector-based synchronized discontinuous PWM (SDPWM) in linear modulation region. Moreover, at a certain reference vector number, the switching frequency can be reduced by 33.3% compared to CSSVPWM and 13.3% to SDPWM. The proposed strategy can also be implemented in the overmodulation region.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7440769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2499774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7440769/07327210.pdf","startPage":"6428","endPage":"6441","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2499774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronized Space-Vector PWM for Three-Level VSI With Lower Harmonic Distortion and Switching Frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Synchronized Space-Vector PWM for Three-Level VSI With Lower Harmonic Distortion and Switching Frequency","volume":"31","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7327210/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"15874607","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB035600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577126 and 51307121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronized Space-Vector PWM for Three-Level VSI With Lower Harmonic Distortion and Switching Frequency","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2499774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101918S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7440769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7440769","articleId":"7327210","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7327212,"authors":[{"name":"Dingwen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7470313/7327212/zhang-2495161-small.gif","p":["Dingwen Zhang received the B.E. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include computer vision and multimedia processing, in particular, on saliency detection, co-saliency detection, and weakly supervised learning."]},"firstName":"Dingwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085395897"},{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7470313/7327212/han-2495161-small.gif","p":["Junwei Han is currently a Full Professor with Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China.

It differs from the conventional saliency detection paradigm in which saliency detection for each image is determined one by one independently without taking advantage of the homogeneity in the data pool of multiple related images. In this paper, we propose a novel cosaliency detection approach using deep learning models. Two new concepts, called intrasaliency prior transfer and deep intersaliency mining, are introduced and explored in the proposed work. For the intrasaliency prior transfer, we build a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to learn the saliency prior knowledge from auxiliary annotated data sets and then transfer the learned knowledge to estimate the intrasaliency for each image in cosaliency data sets. For the deep intersaliency mining, we formulate it by using the deep reconstruction residual obtained in the highest hidden layer of a self-trained SDAE. The obtained deep intersaliency can extract more intrinsic and general hidden patterns to discover the homogeneity of cosalient objects in terms of some higher level concepts. Finally, the cosaliency maps are generated by weighted integration of the proposed intrasaliency prior, deep intersaliency, and traditional shallow intersaliency. Comprehensive experiments over diverse publicly available benchmark data sets demonstrate consistent performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art cosaliency detection methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16002801","htmlLink":"/document/7327212/","pubMedId":"26571541","displayDocTitle":"Cosaliency Detection Based on Intrasaliency Prior Transfer and Deep Intersaliency Mining","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473231 and 61522207"},{"fundingName":"Doctorate Foundation through Northwestern Polytechnical University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cosaliency Detection Based on Intrasaliency Prior Transfer and Deep Intersaliency Mining","sourcePdf":"tnnls-han-2495161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135402S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7470313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7470313","articleId":"7327212","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7327216,"authors":[{"name":"Tulin Atmaca","affiliation":["SAMOVAR, T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, 9 rue Charles Fourier, \u00c9vry, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7511818/7327216/atmac-2499749-small.gif","p":["T\u00fclin Atmaca received the habilitation degree in July 2008 from\n the University of Paris VI and the PhD degree in computer science from The University of Paris XI (ORSAY), in France\n in 1987.

Queueing theory based tools are a natural choice when dealing with performance aspects of the QoS (Quality of Service) part of the SLA and forecasting resource utilization. The characteristics of a cloud center lead to a queueing system with multiple servers (nodes) in which there is potentially a very large number of servers and both the arrival and service process can exhibit high variability. We propose to use a G/G/c-like model to represent a cloud system and assess expected performance indices. Given the potentially high number of servers in a cloud system, we present an efficient, fast and easy-to-implement approximate solution. We have extensively validated our approximation against discrete-event simulation for several QoS performance metrics such as task response time and blocking probability with excellent results. We apply our approach to examples of system sizing and our examples clearly demonstrate the importance of taking into account the variability of the tasks arrivals and thus expose the risk of under- or over-provisioning if one relies on a model with Poisson assumptions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cloud Computing Centers with General Arrivals and Service","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2499749","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2499749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7511818/07327216.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cloud Computing Centers with General Arrivals and Service","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7327216/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16139248","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Cloud Computing Centers with General Arrivals and Service","sourcePdf":"tpds-begin-2499749-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089394S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7511818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7511818","articleId":"7327216","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7327222,"authors":[{"name":"Pandi Vijayakumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University College of Engineering Tindivanam, Tindivanam, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7442200/7327222/vijay-2492981-small.gif","p":["\n\nPandi Vijayakumar received the Bachelor of engineering degree from \nMadurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, India, in 2002; the Master of engineering degree in computer science and \nengineering from Karunya Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, India, in 2005; and the Ph.D. degree in computer science \nand engineering from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2013.

In such environments, security and intelligent decision making are two important challenges needed to be addressed. In this paper, a trusted authority (TA) is designed to provide a variety of online premium services to customers through VANETs. Therefore, it is important to maintain the confidentiality and authentication of messages exchanged between the TA and the VANET nodes. Hence, we address the security problem by focusing on the scenario where the TA classifies the users into primary, secondary, and unauthorized users. In this paper, first, we present a dual authentication scheme to provide a high level of security in the vehicle side to effectively prevent the unauthorized vehicles entering into the VANET. Second, we propose a dual group key management scheme to efficiently distribute a group key to a group of users and to update such group keys during the users' join and leave operations. The major advantage of the proposed dual key management is that adding/revoking users in the VANET group can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by updating a small amount of information. The results of the proposed dual authentication and key management scheme are computationally efficient compared with all other existing schemes discussed in literature, and the results are promising.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2492981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7442200/07327222.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2492981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442200","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Authentication and Key Management Techniques for Secure Data Transmission in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual Authentication and Key Management Techniques for Secure Data Transmission in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874645","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7327222/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CTDT (Centre for Technology Development and Transfer), Anna University Chennai, India","grantNumber":"600025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Authentication and Key Management Techniques for Secure Data Transmission in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-vijayakumar-2492981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119532S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7442200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"7442200","articleId":"7327222","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7327225,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ro\u00dfkopf","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7440769/7327225/robko-small.gif","p":["Andreas Ro\u00dfkopf studied applied mathematics in Erlangen,\n Germany.

The resulting magnetic field on cut sections of the conductor is used as boundary condition for the partial element equivalent circuit method. Based on the coupling of these methods, power losses on litz wire level have been calculated taking different bundle structures and pitch lengths into account. The work flow has been automatized and enables simulations of litz wire systems with hundreds of strands. For different simulation setups, the simulations have been verified by comparison to measurements up to 500 kHz.

Inspired by group-buying mechanisms in real product and service markets, F2C advocates a group of cloud tenants (called tenant coalition) to buy resource capacity in bulk and share the resource pool in the form of virtual machines (VMs). Tenant coalitions leads to vast opportunities for fine-grained resource sharing among multiple tenants. However, resource sharing, especially for multiple resource types, poses several challenging problems in pay-as-you-use cloud environments, such as sharing incentive, free-riding, lying and economic fairness. To address those problems, we propose Reciprocal Resource Fairness (RRF) , a novel resource allocation mechanism to enable fair sharing on multiple resource types within a tenant coalition. RRF is implemented in two complementary and hierarchical mechanisms: inter-tenant resource trading and intra-tenant weight adjustment. RRF satisfies several highly desirable properties to ensure fairness. We implement F2C in Xen platform. The experimental results show F2C is promising for both cloud providers and tenants. For cloud providers, F2C improves VM density and cloud providers' revenue by 2.2X compared to the current IaaS cloud models. For tenants, F2C improves application performance by 45 percent and guarantees 95 percent economic fairness among multiple tenants.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2499769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7534960/07327230.pdf","startPage":"2589","endPage":"2602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2499769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"F2C: Enabling Fair and Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in Multi-Tenant IaaS Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327230/","displayDocTitle":"F2C: Enabling Fair and Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in Multi-Tenant IaaS Clouds","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16208757","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7327230/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61300040"},{"fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"1002-IRIS-09"},{"fundingName":"Environmental & Water Technologies Strategic Research Programme"},{"fundingName":"Environment & Water Industry Programme Office (EWI)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001467","fundingName":"PUB"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"F2C: Enabling Fair and Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in Multi-Tenant IaaS Clouds","sourcePdf":"tpds-liu-2499769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104153S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7534960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7534960","articleId":"7327230","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7327231,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/7368235/7327231/han-small.gif","p":["Shuo Han (S'08-M'14) received the BE and ME degrees in\n electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the PhD degree in\n electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena in 2013.

We assume that we have access to time series data describing the evolution of the spreading process observed by a collection of sensor nodes over a finite time interval. We propose a data-driven robust optimization framework to find the optimal allocation of protection resources (e.g., vaccines and/or antidotes) to eradicate the viral spread at the fastest possible rate. In contrast to current network identification heuristics, in which a single network is identified to explain the observed data, we use available data to define an uncertainty set containing all networks that are coherent with empirical observations. Through Lagrange duality and convexification of the uncertainty set, we are able to relax the robust optimization problem into a conic geometric program, recently proposed by Chandrasekaran and Shah [1], which allows us to efficiently find the optimal allocation of resources to control the worst-case spread that can take place in the uncertainty set of networks. We illustrate our approach in a transportation network from which we collect partial data about the dynamics of a hypothetical epidemic outbreak over a finite period of time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7327231/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15685437","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Network Resource Allocation for Controlling Spreading Processes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1302222, IIS-1447470 and CNS-1239224"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"MARCO"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"DARPA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Network Resource Allocation for Controlling Spreading Processes","sourcePdf":"tnse-han-2500158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180206S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"7368235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7368235","articleId":"7327231","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7327233,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

It is shown in the literature that multiplication in binary fields, including those represented by type-II ONB, shifted polynomial basis, and dual basis, can be transformed into non-symmetric Toeplitz matrix-vector product (TMVP) formulation. In this paper, we show that type-II ONB multiplication can be realized by two symmetric TMVPs (STMVP). Moreover, we have proposed a novel folded TMVP block recombination (TMVPBR) for the computation of STMVP. Based on the proposed folded TMVPBR approach, we have proposed a new digit-serial structure for type-II ONB multiplication, while traditional parallel ONB multipliers are based on non-symmetric TMVPBR approach to achieve subquadratic space complexity architecture. The proposed digit-serial structure also involves subquadratic space complexity. By the theoretical analysis as well as from synthesis result, however, we find that the proposed architecture has significantly less area and less area-delay product compared to the existing digit-serial type-II ONB multipliers.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2495758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2495758","startPage":"2846","endPage":"2855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7347494/07327234.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7347494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-Efficient Subquadratic Space-Complexity Digit-Serial Multiplier for Type-II Optimal Normal Basis of - Using Symmetric TMVP and Block Recombination Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Area-Efficient Subquadratic Space-Complexity Digit-Serial Multiplier for Type-II Optimal Normal Basis of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$GF(2^{m})$</tex> </formula> Using Symmetric TMVP and Block Recombination Techniques","volume":"62","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15661107","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7327234/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-Efficient Subquadratic Space-Complexity Digit-Serial Multiplier for Type-II Optimal Normal Basis of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$GF(2^{m})$</tex> </formula> Using Symmetric TMVP and Block Recombination Techniques","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lee-2495758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085169S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7347494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7347494","articleId":"7327234","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7327235,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Pourghorban Saghati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7343796/7327235/7327235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Pourghorban Saghati (S'11) received the M.Sc. degree (honors) in electrical engineering from Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran, in 2014.

In early systems, the lateral resolution was optimal in the focus but rapidly decreased outside the focal region. Improvements have been found in, e.g., dynamic-receive beamforming, in which the entire image is focused in receive, but this requires complex processing of element data and is not applicable for mechanical scanning of single-element images. This paper exploits the concept of two-stage beamforming based on virtual source-receivers, which reduces the front-end computational load while maintaining a similar data rate and frame rate compared to dynamic-receive beamforming. We introduce frequency-wavenumber domain data processing to obtain fast second-stage data processing while having similarly high lateral resolution as dynamic-receive beamforming and processing in time-space domain. The technique is very suitable in combination with emerging technologies such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), hand-held devices, and wireless data transfer. The suggested method consists of three steps. In the first step, single-focused RF line data are shifted in time to relocate the focal point to a new origin t' = 0, z' = 0. This new origin is considered as an array of virtual source/receiver pairs, as has been suggested previously in literature. In the second step, the dataset is efficiently processed in the wavenumber-frequency domain to form an image that is in focus throughout its entire depth. In the third step, the data shift is undone to obtain a correct depth axis in the image. The method has been tested first with a single-element scanning system and second in a tissue-mimicking phantom using a linear array. In both setups, the method resulted in a -6-dB lateral point spread function (PSF) which was constant over the entire depth range, and similar to dynamic-receive beamforming and synthetic aperture sequential beamforming. The signal-to-noise ratio increased by 6 dB in both the near field and far field. These results show that the second-stage processing algorithm effectively produces a focused image over the entire depth range from a single-focused ultrasound field.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2499839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7368974/07327240.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2499839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"60","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<i>F</i>\u2013 <i>k</i> Domain Imaging for Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"<i>F</i>\u2013 <i>k</i> Domain Imaging for Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327240/","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7327240/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15673364","pubMedId":"26571525","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ZonMW"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002768","fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>F</italic>\u2013 <italic>k</italic> Domain Imaging for Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tuffc-vos-2499839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080137S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7368974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7368974","articleId":"7327240","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7327244,"authors":[{"name":"Dixian Zhao","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Dixian","lastName":"Zhao","nativeName":"\u8d75\u6da4\u71f9"},{"name":"Patrick Reynaert","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Flanders, BE"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Reynaert"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"7327244","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2526},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper reports a fully integrated 40-nm CMOS power amplifier (PA) for E-band applications.

The optimization algorithm optimizes the drain waveforms by maximizing the fundamental output power while minimizing the harmonic and dissipated components. The optimization process is automated using simulation software. Circuit-based BO and electromagnetic-based (EM-based) BO are applied to design 10 and 30 W PAs. The 10 W PA designed using circuit-based BO achieves a drain efficiency higher than 60% with output power greater than 39.8 dBm from 1.5 to 2.5 GHz, while the 30 W PA designed using EM-based BO offers a drain efficiency higher than 57% with output power greater than 43.8 dBm across the band. Upon comparison of results, it is revealed that the proposed strategy outperforms a commercial electronic design automation (EDA) software's built-in optimizer, thus demonstrating that the EM-based BO is well-suited to the challenge of high power designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15635483","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7327246/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Optimization for Broadband High-Efficiency Power Amplifier Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Optimization for Broadband High-Efficiency Power Amplifier Designs","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2495360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065848S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7343796","articleId":"7327246","onlineDate":"11 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":7327256,"authors":[{"name":"U.

It includes a three-stage topology composed by a pre-driver, driver, and a class-J main stage, to optimize the output power and power-added efficiency (PAE) over 1.7-2.05 GHz, thus encapsulating the LTE bands 1 to 4, 9 to 10, 33 to 37, and 39. This is achieved through a novel analog pre-distorter linearizer, which features two sub-circuits for AM-AM and AM-PM linearization. The PA prototype meets the standard's adjacent channel leakage ratio at a maximum linear output power of 28 dBm. Tested at 2.05 GHz and for a 16-QAM scheme, the maximum error vector magnitude is 3.38% at a 28-dBm output power, which corresponds to a PAE of 40.5%-55.8% across bands. The input return loss is 15 dB and the maximum power gain is 35.8 dB, while demonstrating an unconditional stable characteristic from dc up to 5 GHz. The die area is 950 \u03bcm\u00d7900 \u03bcm.

This model has a generalized structure that is constructed via first generating a nonlinear basis function that maps the inputs to the target frequency band where the distortion is to be cancelled, and then multiplying with a second basis function that generates envelope-dependent nonlinearities. By combining these two bases, the model keeps in a relatively compact form that can be flexibly implemented in digital circuits such as field programmable gate array (FPGA).

The influence of parasitic high order transverse modes are restricted through the engineering of antenna structure (ridge and antenna width) to couple out the fundamental mode only.","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2015.7327479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2015.7327479","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2015 40th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 40th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301993/7327382/07327479.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Far-field engineering of metal-metal terahertz quantum cascade lasers with integrated horn antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327479/","conferenceDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Far-field engineering of metal-metal terahertz quantum cascade lasers with integrated horn antennas","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15599064","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7327479/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-field engineering of metal-metal terahertz quantum cascade lasers with integrated horn antennas","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"H1B33139025FarfieldEngineeringOfMetalmetal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.379765S","chronDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301993","isNumber":"7327382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301993","xplore-issue":"7327382","articleId":"7327479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7327702,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey V.

Due to GaN's high electric field breakdown capability and good 2D electron gas mobility in heterostructure field effect transistors, GaN power amplifiers provide best performance for high output power, high efficiency and small MMIC form factor amplifiers at W-band frequencies. GaN low noise amplifiers can also provide large receiver input dynamic range, reduce receiver noise figure and can be more tolerant of input power leakage from the transmitter without the need of protective limiter circuitry. All these, characteristics are crucial for high frequency arrays where design require small circuit spacings, high efficiency to reduce power consumption and heating, and the minimization of circuit components for manufacturability and reliability. We will discuss results of power, driver and low noise amplifiers that we have designed, fabricated and characterized for radar array applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","MMICs","Power amplifiers","Radar","Power generation","Geoscience","NASA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","electron mobility","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","integrated circuit reliability","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave integrated circuits","millimetre wave power amplifiers","MMIC power amplifiers","semiconductor device reliability","two-dimensional electron gas","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band gallium nitride MMIC amplifiers","cloud Doppler radar arrays","monolithic microwave integrated circuit amplifiers","2D electron gas mobility","heterostructure field effect transistors","gallium nitride power amplifiers","MMIC form factor amplifiers","gallium nitride low noise amplifiers","reliability","frequency 75 GHz to 110 GHz","GaN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2015.7327723","publicationTitle":"2015 40th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 40th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301993/7327382/07327723.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2015.7327723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"W-band gallium nitride MMIC amplifiers for cloud Doppler radar arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"W-band gallium nitride MMIC amplifiers for cloud Doppler radar arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7327723/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7327723/","accessionNumber":"15599040","conferenceDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"W-band gallium nitride MMIC amplifiers for cloud Doppler radar arrays","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T2E13133603WBandGalliumNitrideMMICAmplifie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039424S","chronDate":"23-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301993","isNumber":"7327382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301993","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7327382","articleId":"7327723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7327738,"authors":[{"name":"Takuro Tajima","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuro","lastName":"Tajima","id":"37085460875"},{"name":"Jae-Young Kim","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jae-Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085425439"},{"name":"Masahito Nakamura","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37085749955"},{"name":"Ho-jin Song","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ho-jin","lastName":"Song","id":"37085752959"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Ajito","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Ajito","id":"37541187300"},{"name":"Akihiko Hirata","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiko","lastName":"Hirata","id":"37085752372"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8272-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8271-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2027"}],"articleNumber":"7327738","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable CW THz spectroscopy with PLC-LN hybrid phase modulator","abstract":"We present a compact and stable continuous-wave terahertz spectroscopic system with a planar lightwave circuit-LiNbO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n phase modulator for terahertz phase control.

Processing natural language text produced by software developers is challenging because of unique characteristics not found in other texts, such as the presence of code terms and the systematic use of incomplete sentences. In addition, texts produced by Portuguese-speaking developers mix languages since many keywords and programming concepts are referred to by their English name. In this paper, we provide empirical insights into the challenges of analyzing software artifacts written in Portuguese. We analyzed 100 question titles from the Portuguese version of Stack Overflow with two Portuguese language tools and identified multiple problems which resulted in very few sentences being tagged completely correctly. Based on these results, we propose heuristics to improve the analysis of natural language text produced by software developers in Portuguese.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589726","htmlLink":"/document/7328022/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-26 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Challenges in Analyzing Software Documentation in Portuguese","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges in Analyzing Software Documentation in Portuguese","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"9272a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063623S","chronDate":"21-26 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7324164","isNumber":"7327993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7324164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7327993","articleId":"7328022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328056,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Yu","id":"37075464500"},{"name":"Haricharan Lakshman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Haricharan","lastName":"Lakshman","id":"37395147700"},{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Girod","id":"37085380528"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7660-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328056","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":190,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":2993},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Bit rate","Approximation methods","Head","Video coding","Streaming media","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","helmet mounted displays","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional video coding schemes","head-mounted display","viewport extraction","head motion trajectories","sphere-to-plane mappings","viewport quality","weighted spherical PSNR","peak signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328056","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327075/7328030/07328056.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR.2015.12","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR.2015.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328030","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework to Evaluate Omnidirectional Video Coding Schemes","abstract":"Omnidirectional videos of real world environments viewed on head-mounted displays with real-time head motion tracking can offer immersive visual experiences. For live streaming applications, compression is critical to reduce the bitrate. Omnidirectional videos, which are spherical in nature, are mapped onto one or more planes before encoding to interface with modern video coding standards. In this paper, we consider the problem of evaluating the coding efficiency in the context of viewing with a head-mounted display. We extract viewport based head motion trajectories, and compare the original and coded videos on the viewport. With this approach, we compare different sphere-to-plane mappings. We show that the average viewport quality can be approximated by a weighted spherical PSNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328056/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 3 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15589772","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328056/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Framework to Evaluate Omnidirectional Video Coding Schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework to Evaluate Omnidirectional Video Coding Schemes","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"7660a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045287S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327075","isNumber":"7328030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327075","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"7328030","articleId":"7328056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7328126,"authors":[{"name":"Shaymaa Al-Shammari","affiliation":["School of computing, Sciences and Engineering University of Salford, Greater Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Shaymaa","lastName":"Al-Shammari","id":"37085676851"},{"name":"Adil Al-Yasiri","affiliation":["School of computing, Sciences and Engineering University of Salford, Greater Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Adil","lastName":"Al-Yasiri","id":"37085666991"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7935-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7934-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-6937"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-6910"}],"articleNumber":"7328126","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"abstract":"Measuring the quality of cloud computing provision from the client's point of view is important in order to ensure that the service conforms to the level specified in the service level agreement (SLA). With a view to avoid SLA violation, the main parameters should be determined in the agreement and then used to evaluate the fulfillment of the SLA terms at the client's side. Current studies in cloud monitoring only handle monitoring the provider resources with little or no consideration to the client's side. This paper presents MonSLAR, a User-centric middleware for Monitoring SLA for Restful services in SaaS cloud computing environments. MonSLAR uses a distributed architecture that allows SLA parameters and the monitored data to be embedded in the requests and responses of the REST protocol.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Environments (MESOCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7321993/7328114/07328126.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Environments (MESOCA)","doi":"10.1109/MESOCA.2015.7328126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESOCA.2015.7328126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MonSLAR: a middleware for monitoring SLA for RESTFUL services in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Measurement","Software as a service","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MonSLAR","SLA service","RESTFUL service","service level agreement","cloud monitoring","user-centric middleware","SaaS cloud computing environment","distributed architecture","REST protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","QoE","SLA monitoring","SaaS","REST"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"MonSLAR: a middleware for monitoring SLA for RESTFUL services in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328126/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15589708","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MonSLAR: a middleware for monitoring SLA for RESTFUL services in cloud computing","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p46-alshammari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050085S","chronDate":"2-2 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321993","isNumber":"7328114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321993","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7328114","articleId":"7328126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328144,"authors":[{"name":"Vangelis Gazis","affiliation":["AGT Group (R&D) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Vangelis","lastName":"Gazis","id":"37330476000"},{"name":"Alessandro Leonardi","affiliation":["AGT Group (R&D) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Leonardi","id":"37085534253"},{"name":"Kostas Mathioudakis","affiliation":["AGT Group (R&D) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Mathioudakis","id":"37085578395"},{"name":"Konstantinos Sasloglou","affiliation":["AGT Group (R&D) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Sasloglou","id":"37403099900"},{"name":"Panayotis Kikiras","affiliation":["AGT Group (R&D) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Panayotis","lastName":"Kikiras","id":"37550545500"},{"name":"Raghuram Sudhaakar","affiliation":["Cisco Systems Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Raghuram","lastName":"Sudhaakar","id":"37542347600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7392-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7391-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328144","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1286},"abstract":"The \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) represents an em- bodiment of the continuous convergence between the physical facet of human activities and its reflection on the informa- tion world.

Modern power estimators for FPGA either support specific hardware provided by vendors or contain power models for certain types of conventional FPGA architectures. However, with technology advancement, novel FPGA of versatile architectures are introduced to further augment current FPGA architecture at various aspects, such as emerging FPGA with non-volatile memory, nanowire interconnection of reconfigurable array, etc. To evaluate the power consumption of various FPGA designs, the power estimator has to be made more flexible and extendable for supporting new devices and architectures.

Simulation results of benchmarks of our power estimator against commercial one demonstrate accuracy of our tool. Furthermore, we present an example of RRAM FPGA power estimation, which has novel memory devices and potential of power gating. Our tool demonstrates flexibility to well support, but not limited to, the power estimation of such state-of-the-art FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2015.44","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327976/7328148/07328183.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2015.44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Library Based Power Estimator for Versatile FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Library Based Power Estimator for Versatile FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328183/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601282","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Library Based Power Estimator for Versatile FPGAs","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"8670a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065523S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327976","isNumber":"7328148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327976","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7328148","articleId":"7328183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328189,"authors":[{"name":"Masakazu Tanomoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Tanomoto","id":"37085711817"},{"name":"Shinya Takamaeda-Yamazaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Takamaeda-Yamazaki","id":"37085414310"},{"name":"Jun Yao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yao","id":"37716514300"},{"name":"Yasuhiko Nakashima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiko","lastName":"Nakashima","id":"37646839900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8670-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8669-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328189","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1299},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CGRA-Based Approach for Accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327976/7328148/07328189.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2015.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328148","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2015.41","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Bandwidth","Hardware","Machine learning","Acceleration","Neural networks","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed memory systems","embedded systems","graphics processing units","learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","neural nets","performance evaluation","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CGRA-based approach","convolutional neural network","machine learning application","GPU-based hardware approach","application-specific hardware approach","coarse grained reconfigurable architecture","low-power embedded system","distributed scratchpad memory block","memory bandwidth pressure","CNN accelerator","multicore CPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","CGRA","Accelerator Architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328189","abstract":"Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an emerging approach for achieving high recognition accuracy in various machine learning applications. To accelerate CNN computations, various GPU-based or application-specific hardware approaches have been recently proposed.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate CNN computations using a CGRA (Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architecture) for low-power embedded systems. We first present a new CGRA with distributed scratchpad memory blocks for efficient temporal blocking to reduce memory bandwidth pressure. We then show the architecture of our CNN accelerator using the CGRA with some dedicated software implementation.

Indeed, they are represented by the software platform using compute unified device architecture from NVIDIA, and the one of particle swarm optimization (PSO) which can be executed simultaneously on GPUs to speed up complex optimization problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper, we illustrate a novel parallel approach to run standard particle swarm optimization PSO on GPUs and applied to TSP (GPU-PSO-A-TSP). Both the developed and the previous PSO centroid algorithm are implemented on the GPUs. The achieved results show that we have obtained at least one order of magnitude difference between speed of the GPUs and a typical sequential CPU implementation for performance optimization. Results show also that running speed of GPU-PSO is four times as fast as that of CPU-PSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328194/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15589803","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328194/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GPU Particle Swarm Optimization Applied to Travelling Salesman Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU Particle Swarm Optimization Applied to Travelling Salesman Problem","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"8670a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064461S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327976","isNumber":"7328148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327976","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7328148","articleId":"7328194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328195,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Bortolotti","affiliation":["DEI"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Bortolotti","id":"38231936500"},{"name":"Andrea Bartolini","affiliation":["DEI","Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bartolini","id":"37883004300"},{"name":"Mauro Mangia","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Mangia","id":"37542676000"},{"name":"Riccardo Rovatti","affiliation":["DEI","ARCES University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Rovatti","id":"37269656400"},{"name":"Gianluca Setti","affiliation":["ENDIF University of Ferrara, Italy","ARCES University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Setti","id":"37085342171"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8670-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8669-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328195","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Logic gates","Sensors","Monitoring","Standards","Electrocardiography","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","compressed sensing","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","power aware computing","smart phones","system-on-chip","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware bio-signal compressed sensing reconstruction","FOCUSS","ultra-low power wearable bio-sensors","wellness applications","continuous vital signs monitoring","bio-sensing nodes","wireless body sensor network","electrocardiogram","ECG","WBSN gateway","smartphone","features extraction","online reconstruction","battery powered devices","rakeness-based compressed sensing","CS","signal reconstruction algorithm","mobile SoC","ARM big.LITTLE architecture","QoS-energy trade-offs","Cortex-A7","J-window","Cortex-A15","CPU consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficiency","Bio-signal Reconstruction","big.

Such bio-sensing nodes are typically integrated in Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) to acquire and process biomedical signals, e.g. Electrocardiogram (ECG), and transmit them to the WBSN gateway, e.g. smartphone, for online reconstruction or features extraction. Both bio-sensing node and gateway are battery powered devices, although they show very different autonomy requirements (weeks vs. days). The rakeness-based Compressed Sensing (CS) proved to outperform standard CS, achieving a higher compression for the same quality level, therefore reducing the transmission costs in the node. However, most of the research focus has been on the efficiency of the node, neglecting the energy cost of the CS decoder. In this work, we evaluate the energy cost and real-time reconstruction feasibility on the gateway, considering the FOCUSS signal reconstruction algorithm running on a heterogeneous mobile SoC based on the ARM big. LITTLE TM architecture. The experimental results show that standard CS does not satisfy real-time constraints, while the rakeness enables different QoS-energy trade-offs, achieving the most efficient real-time reconstruction on the Cortex-A7 @ 1.3 GHz for 0.2 J/window (for a target QoS of 23 dB), while the lowest CPU consumption is achieved with the Cortex-A15 @ 1.9 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2015.34","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327976/7328148/07328195.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2015.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Bio-signal Compressed Sensing Reconstruction: FOCUSS on the WBSN-Gateway","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328195/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Bio-signal Compressed Sensing Reconstruction: FOCUSS on the WBSN-Gateway","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328195/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Bio-signal Compressed Sensing Reconstruction: FOCUSS on the WBSN-Gateway","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"8670a120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079764S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327976","isNumber":"7328148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327976","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7328148","articleId":"7328195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328205,"authors":[{"name":"Cedric Nugteren","affiliation":["SURFsara HPC centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Nugteren","id":"37888310500"},{"name":"Valeriu Codreanu","affiliation":["SURFsara HPC centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Valeriu","lastName":"Codreanu","id":"37992881100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8670-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8669-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328205","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLTune: A Generic Auto-Tuner for OpenCL Kernels","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327976/7328148/07328205.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2015.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328148","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2015.10","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Convolution","Performance evaluation","Tuners","Simulated annealing","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","public domain software","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CLTune","auto-tuner","OpenCL kernels","open-source","GPU","2D convolution","matrix-multiplication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenCL","Auto-Tuning","GPU","Convolution","GEMM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328205","abstract":"This work presents CLTune, an auto-tuner for OpenCL kernels. It evaluates and tunes kernel performance of a generic, user-defined search space of possible parameter-value combinations. Example parameters include the OpenCL workgroup size, vector data-types, tile sizes, and loop unrolling factors. CLTune can be used in the following scenarios: 1) when there are too many tunable parameters to explore manually, 2) when performance portability across OpenCL devices is desired, or 3) when the optimal parameters change based on input argument values (e.g. matrix dimensions). The auto-tuner is generic, easy to use, open-source, and supports multiple search strategies including simulated annealing and particle swarm optimisation. CLTune is evaluated on two GPU case-studies inspired by the recent successes in deep learning: 2D convolution and matrix-multiplication (GEMM). For 2D convolution, we demonstrate the need for auto-tuning by optimizing for different filter sizes, achieving performance on-par or better than the state-of-the-art. For matrix-multiplication, we use CLTune to explore a parameter space of more than two-hundred thousand configurations, we show the need for device-specific tuning, and outperform the clBLAS library on NVIDIA, AMD and Intel GPUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589797","htmlLink":"/document/7328205/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CLTune: A Generic Auto-Tuner for OpenCL Kernels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLTune: A Generic Auto-Tuner for OpenCL Kernels","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"8670a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070353S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327976","isNumber":"7328148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327976","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7328148","articleId":"7328205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7328212,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Opoku Agyeman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Michael Opoku","lastName":"Agyeman","id":"37946375600"},{"name":"Ji-Xiang Wan","affiliation":["Xian Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xian, PRC"],"firstName":"Ji-Xiang","lastName":"Wan","id":"37085661101"},{"name":"Quoc-Tuan Vien","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London"],"firstName":"Quoc-Tuan","lastName":"Vien","id":"37391821000"},{"name":"Wen Zong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zong","id":"37085660125"},{"name":"Alex Yakovlev","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, UK"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Yakovlev","id":"37281350900"},{"name":"Kenneth Tong","affiliation":["Departmeut of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085668605"},{"name":"Terrence Mak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Terrence","lastName":"Mak","id":"37281072900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8670-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8669-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328212","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Fabrics","Surface waves","Reliability","Transducers","Transceivers","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wired-wireless network-on-chip architecture","WiNoC","system-on-chip","SoC","communication fabric","millimeter wave communication","free space signal radiation","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","Network-on-Chip","WiNoC","Communication Fabric","Hybrid Wireless Network-on-Chip"]}],"abstract":"With the ever increase in transistor density over technology scaling, energy and performance aware hybrid wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC) has emerged as an alternative solution to the slow conventional wireline NoC design for future System-on-Chip (SoC). However, combining wireless and wireline channels drastically reduces the total reliability of the communication fabric. Besides being lossy, existing feasible wireless solution for WiNoCs, which is in the form of millimeter wave (mm-Wave), relies on free space signal radiation which has high power dissipation with high degradation rate in the signal strength per transmission distance. Alternatively, low power wireless communication fabric in the form of surface wave has been proposed for on-chip communication. With the right design considerations, the reliability and performance benefits of the surface wave channel could be extended. In this paper, we propose a surface wave communication fabric for emerging WiNoCs that is able to match the channel reliability of traditional wireline NoCs. Here, a carefully designed transducer and commercially available thin metal conductor coated with a low cost dielectric material are employed to general surface wave signal to improve the wireless signal transmission gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed communication fabric can achieve a 5dB operational bandwidth of about 60GHz around the center frequency (60GHz). By improving the transmission reliability of wireless layer, the proposed communication fabric can improve maximum sustainable load of NoCs by an average of 20.9% and 133.3% compared to existing WiNoCs and wireline NoCs, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2015.11","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel7/7327976/7328148/07328212.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2015.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328148","startPage":"251","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Reliable Hybrid Wired-Wireless Network-on-Chip Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Reliable Hybrid Wired-Wireless Network-on-Chip Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328212/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15589815","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328212/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Reliable Hybrid Wired-Wireless Network-on-Chip Architectures","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"8670a251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081366S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7327976","isNumber":"7328148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7327976","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7328148","articleId":"7328212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328241,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Okamoto","affiliation":["Photonics Electronics Technology Research Association, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Daisuke Okamoto received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in nuclear\n engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

The receiver chip was designed using a photonics\u2014electronics convergence design technique for the realization of high-speed and high-efficiency operation because the interfaces of the optical and electrical components greatly influence the receiver characteristics. Optical pins were used to obtain easy optical alignment between the multimode fibers and the germanium photodetectors. An aluminum stripline between the PD and the TIA enhanced the 3-dB bandwidth because its characteristic impedance is greater than the TIA input impedance. Coplanar waveguides (CPWs) on the etched SOI wafer achieved a low insertion loss because the overlap between the electric fields of the CPWs and the silicon layer was reduced. We demonstrated 25-Gb/s error-free operation at both 25 and at 85\u00a0\u00b0C. The minimum sensitivities and power consumptions of the receivers were \u221211.0 dBm and 2.3 mW/Gb/s at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and \u221210.2 dBm and 2.5 mW/Gb/s at 85\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

In addition, high penetration of renewables, development of energy-efficient cooling facilities, and flexibility of distributed storage units, all call for a system-wide energy and workload management policy for future sustainable data centers. As implementing offline management policies is practically infeasible due to complexity and the lack of future information, real-time management schemes are considered here under a systematic framework. Leveraging stochastic optimization tools, a unified management approach is proposed allowing data centers to adaptively respond to intermittent availability of renewables, variability of cooling efficiency, information technology (IT) workload shift, and energy price fluctuations under long-term quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Meanwhile, it is rigorously established that when storage devices have sufficiently high capacity, or, the difference between electricity purchase and selling prices is small, the proposed algorithm yields a feasible and near-optimal management strategy without knowing the distributions of the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) workload, renewable, and electricity price processes. Numerical results further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works well not only for i.i.d. processes, but also in real-data scenarios, where the underlying randomness is highly correlated over time.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500189","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7406776/07328245.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"402","endPage":"415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooling-Aware Energy and Workload Management in Data Centers via Stochastic Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328245","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/7406776/7328245-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooling-Aware Energy and Workload Management in Data Centers via Stochastic Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328245/","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7328245/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786078","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Cooling-Aware Energy and Workload Management in Data Centers via Stochastic Optimization","sourcePdf":"jstsp-giannakis-2500189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168157S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7406776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7406776","articleId":"7328245","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328247,"authors":[{"name":"Huaizhou Jin","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metrological Technology and Instrument, Ministry of Education, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huaizhou","lastName":"Jin","id":"37072140600"},{"name":"Shangzhong Jin","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metrological Technology and Instrument, Ministry of Education, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shangzhong","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402486300"},{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metrological Technology and Instrument, Ministry of Education, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085428994"},{"name":"Songyuan Cen","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metrological Technology and Instrument, Ministry of Education, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Songyuan","lastName":"Cen","id":"37409563300"},{"name":"Kun Yuan","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metrological Technology and Instrument, Ministry of Education, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37072248900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7328247","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"LED street lights used in this research.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"28KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7305892/7328247/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2497578.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7305892/7328247/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2497578.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Roads","Light sources","Pollution","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colour","light emitting diodes","street lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED street lights","lighting performance","light-emitting diodes","phosphor-coated LED","correlated color temperature","CCT","mesopic vision illuminance","dark adaption","color perception","fog penetration","skyglow pollution","PC-LED"]},{"kwd":["Light emitting diodes","lighting","mesopic vision","skyglow","fog transmission"]}],"abstract":"While light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a very efficient lighting option, whether phosphor-coated LEDs (PC-LEDs) are suitable for street lighting remains to be tested.

Three separate groups in Japan are actively developing superconducting motors for marine propulsion. The Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology group developed the world's first axial-gap coreless high-temperature superconducting motor (HTS) with a 100-kW output for a liquid neon thermosiphon cooled superconducting machine over a period from 2004 to 2007. The IHI Corporation group has developed four types of axial-type HTS motors since 2004. Using a cooling system based on liquid nitrogen, they achieved the world's highest output at 365 kW in 2007. The Kawasaki Heavy Industries group has been developing radial-type HTS motors since 2007. In 2010, the group developed a 1-MW motor that achieved an output of 450 kW. In 2013, the group also developed a 3-MW motor that achieved an output of 3 MW.

With this constraint, we derive closed-form expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP) of both homogeneous networks and K-tier HetNets based on stochastic geometry. Our analysis reveals that security performance can be improved by deploying more low-power BSs in high path-loss environments. Besides, the SOP stays unchanged when the receiving threshold is below a critical point and increases rapidly when exceeding that point.

The CASSI imaging process can be modeled as suppressing three-dimensional coded and shifted voxels and projecting these onto a two-dimensional plane, such that the number of acquired measurements is greatly reduced. On the other hand, because the measurements are highly compressive, the reconstruction process becomes challenging. We previously proposed a compressive imaging reconstruction algorithm that is applied to two-dimensional images based on the approximate message passing (AMP) framework. AMP is an iterative algorithm that can be used in signal and image reconstruction by performing denoising at each iteration. We employed an adaptive Wiener filter as the image denoiser, and called our algorithm \u201cAMP-Wiener.\u201d In this paper, we extend AMP-Wiener to three-dimensional hyperspectral image reconstruction, and call it \u201cAMP-3D-Wiener.\u201d Applying the AMP framework to the CASSI system is challenging, because the matrix that models the CASSI system is highly sparse, and such a matrix is not suitable to AMP and makes it difficult for AMP to converge. Therefore, we modify the adaptive Wiener filter and employ a technique called damping to solve for the divergence issue of AMP. Our approach is applied in nature, and the numerical experiments show that AMP-3D-Wiener outperforms existing widely-used algorithms such as gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) and two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) given a similar amount of runtime. Moreover, in contrast to GPSR and TwIST, AMP-3D-Wiener need not tune any parameters, which simplifies the reconstruction process.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500190","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7406776/07328255.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"389","endPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Approximate Message Passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328255","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/7406776/7328255-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Approximate Message Passing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328255/","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7328255/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786076","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"CCF-1217749"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Approximate Message Passing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-tan-2500190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100315S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7406776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7406776","articleId":"7328255","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328264,"authors":[{"name":"Donghwan Jeong","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"p":["\nDonghwan Jeong is currently working toward an MS at the Department of Semiconductor and Display Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon, Korea.

They can be characterized by homogenized-boundary conditions, which, in absence of losses, can be represented through an equivalent reactance. In this paper, we introduce a general representation of isotropic frequency-dependent reactance which is valid along the dispersion curve of the relevant TM SW. This representation is written in terms of a transition function derived from a manipulation of the Cardano's formula for third-degree algebraic equations. Throughout a large portion of the dispersion curve, this transition function depends on one parameter only, which is an equivalent quasi-static capacitance. Approaching the Floquet-Bloch region, where many higher order Floquet modes are excited, two additional parameters should be extracted from the full-wave data to complete the transitional representation of the reactance until the upper boundary of the Brillouin region. The final formula is valid for a generic isotropic reactance and for an anisotropic reactance when the direction of propagation is along a symmetry axis of the unit cell element.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328270/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685588","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transition Function for Closed-Form Representation of Metasurface Reactance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transition Function for Closed-Form Representation of Metasurface Reactance","sourcePdf":"tap-maci-2500264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058706S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7369997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7369997","articleId":"7328270","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7328274,"authors":[{"name":"Asit Kumar Pradhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (ITT) Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7328274/pradh-2500234-small.gif","p":["Asit Kumar Pradhan received the B.Tech. degree from Biju Patnaik University of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

The proposed antenna, which is a differential one, has high gain and wide bandwidth and can be built on a single-layer laminate using standard printed-circuit board (PCB) technology. This makes the antenna both low cost and easy to integrate with common differential circuits. The antenna consists of an opening cavity formed by metalized vias, which encloses a set of loop-like strips that are fed differentially. The strips carry traveling wave current which together with the aperture's E-fields distribution give rise to CP radiation. The aperture size of the antenna can be extended for higher gain by adopting a dual- or quadruple-loop-like strips configuration enclosed by a larger opening cavity. The fabricated quadruple-loop-like strips-based antenna prototype designed to operate at 60-GHz band could achieve 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 16.7% (56-66.2 GHz) within its -10-dB impedance bandwidth and stable right-handed CP (RHCP) gain throughout the operating bandwidth with a peak of 14.6 dBi.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

This paper presents a new method to address the above issue. In our method, after generating an offspring for each parent in the population by making use of differential evolution (DE), the well-known feasibility rule is used to compare the offspring and its parent. Since the feasibility rule prefers constraints to objective function, the objective function information has been exploited as follows: if the offspring cannot survive into the next generation and if the objective function value of the offspring is better than that of the parent, then the offspring is stored into a predefined archive. Subsequently, the individuals in the archive are used to replace some individuals in the population according to a replacement mechanism. Moreover, a mutation strategy is proposed to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Note that, in the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy, the comparison of individuals is based on objective function. In addition, the information of objective function has also been utilized to generate offspring in DE. By the above processes, this paper achieves an effective balance between constraints and objective function in constrained evolutionary optimization. The performance of our method has been tested on two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions at IEEE CEC2006 and 18 test functions with 10-D and 30-D at IEEE CEC2010. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method shows better or at least competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the advantage of our method increases with the increase of the number of decision variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16465600","htmlLink":"/document/7328281/","pubMedId":"26584504","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Objective Function Information Into the Feasibility Rule for Constrained Evolutionary Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program 973 of China","grantNumber":"2011CB013104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002822","fundingName":"Innovation-driven Plan in Central South University","grantNumber":"2015CXS012 and 2015CX007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273314, 51175519 and 61175064"},{"fundingName":"RGC of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"CityU: 11207714"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0596"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005085","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems, Beijing Institute of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Objective Function Information Into the Feasibility Rule for Constrained Evolutionary Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2493239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136186S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7328281","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328286,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7349121/7328286/xu-2500178-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Xu (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communications and information system.

Unlike existing works in the literature, we focus on the beyond wireless body area network (beyond-WBAN) communications. In the considered system, medical packets arrive randomly at each gateway (which ordinarily stands for one patient), and their transmission requests are reported to the network regulator (i.e., the base station) with specific delay sensitivities that reflect their medical signal severities. The base station then determines the order of transmission by formulating a priority queue. With the construction of the packets' utility and the base station's profit functions, we analyze the characteristics of the service system and design an incentive-compatible mechanism such that all gateways will be forced to report the actual delay sensitivities of their medical packets. Theoretical analyses show that our proposed mechanism can maximize the profit of the base station (i.e., minimize the total waiting cost from all medical packet transmissions) while guaranteeing higher service priorities to more emergent medical packets. Numerical results examine the properties of the proposed mechanism, and demonstrate its feasibility in providing economic incentives for all individuals.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2500241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7556449/07328289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2500241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7556449","startPage":"2424","endPage":"2436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incentive-Compatible Mechanism for Transmission Scheduling of Delay-Sensitive Medical Packets in E-Health Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Incentive-Compatible Mechanism for Transmission Scheduling of Delay-Sensitive Medical Packets in E-Health Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"10","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16269320","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7328289/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incentive-Compatible Mechanism for Transmission Scheduling of Delay-Sensitive Medical Packets in E-Health Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-cai-2500241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123902S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7556449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7556449","articleId":"7328289","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7328290,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyuan Huang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering and Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-Speed Magnetically Suspended Motor Technology and Application, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7328290/huang-2500188-small.gif","p":["Ziyuan Huang received the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012.

This paper focuses on the loss analysis and thermal performance evaluation for a rotor of 100 kW, 32 km/min high-speed permanent-magnet motor. The rotor temperature distribution based on the finite element method is obtained by accounting for various losses, including air-friction loss of the rotor, iron loss of the active magnetic bearing, and eddy-current loss of the motor. The influence of the stator core temperature on rotor thermal performance is analyzed by using a coupling simulation of fluid-temperature field. The temperature rise measurement of rotor is employed to study the impact of different cooling way on rotor thermal performance and to verify the computational accuracy of losses and temperature distribution. The analysis result of air-friction loss is compared with the measurement, which is obtained from the total losses by using the method of loss separation. It has great significance for the cooling structure design and the efficiency enhancement of electrical machine.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2500188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2500188","startPage":"2027","endPage":"2035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7428980/07328290.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss Calculation and Thermal Analysis of Rotors Supported by Active Magnetic Bearings for High-Speed Permanent-Magnet Electrical Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Loss Calculation and Thermal Analysis of Rotors Supported by Active Magnetic Bearings for High-Speed Permanent-Magnet Electrical Machines","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328290/","accessionNumber":"15837307","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328290/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Major Project for the Development and Application of Scientific Instrument Equipment of China","grantNumber":"2012YQ040235"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss Calculation and Thermal Analysis of Rotors Supported by Active Magnetic Bearings for High-Speed Permanent-Magnet Electrical Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-huang-2500188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077341S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7328290","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7328293,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yulin","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yulin","id":"37297639900"},{"name":"Wang Zhaokui","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhaokui","id":"37946407800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-9050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0016"}],"articleNumber":"7328293","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":734},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","url":"http://sites.ieee.org/itss/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328293","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Aerospace electronics","Space debris","Orbits","Safety","Mathematical model","Rockets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","air traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organized control","space traffic management","safety control","space surveillance","space debris","space traffic safety management","space traffic safety control","launch activities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Avalanche effect","space debris","self-organized control","space traffic"]},{"kwd":["Avalanche effect","space debris","self-organized control","space traffic"]}],"abstract":"With the sustained launch activities and the growth of space debris population, the space traffic safety problems become more and more serious.

However, for PU's secrecy capacity, the SUs' interference can be beneficial if it decreases the capacity of the source-eavesdropper channel more than that of the source-destination channel. In this paper, we consider using the SUs' interference to improve the PU's secrecy capacity and providing the SUs the opportunity to access the spectrum as a reward. But, there exists a tradeoff between the SUs' channel capacity and the PU's secrecy capacity. To decide which SUs can share the spectrum with the PU, we present a coalition formation game model with nontransferable utility, and propose a merge and split algorithm. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the SUs' channel capacity and the PU's secrecy capacity in various scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Improves PHY Security for Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2500184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7365556/07328294.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2500184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7365556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Interference Improves PHY Security for Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7328294/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15716130","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2015AA01A709"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222104 and U1301255"},{"fundingName":"2012 Beijing Nova Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Improves PHY Security for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-song-2500184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130264S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7365556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7365556","articleId":"7328294","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328297,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Stoecklin","affiliation":["Department of Microsystems Engineering, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7429975/7328297/stoec-2482278-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Stoecklin (S\u201915) received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in microsystems engineering with a focus on circuits and systems from the Department of Microsystems Engineering, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Laboratory for Electrical Instrumentation.","He is a Research Assistant with the Laboratory for Electrical Instrumentation, University of Freiburg, where he focuses on efficient and miniaturized wireless powering systems for wearable and implantable sensors and devices.

The optimization objectives are thereby size, energy efficiency, and tissue absorption. Within the first step, the influence of the operational frequency on the given quantities is computed by means of finite element simulations, yielding a compromise of power transfer efficiency of the wireless link and acceptable tissue heating in terms of the specific absorption rate. All simulations account for the layered structure of the human head, modeling the dielectric properties with Cole-Cole dispersion effects. In the second step, the relevant coupling and loss effects of the transmission coils are modeled as a function of the geometrical design parameters, enabling a noniterative and comprehensible mathematical derivation of the optimum coil geometry given an external size constraint. Further investigations of the optimum link design also consider high-permeability structures being applied to the primary coil, enhancing the efficiency by means of an increased mutual inductance. Thereby, a final link efficiency of 80% at a coil separation distance of 5 mm and 20% at 20 mm using a 10-mm planar receiving coil can be achieved, contributing to a higher integration density of multichannel brain implanted sensors. Moreover, the given procedure does not only give insight into the optimization of the coil design, but also provides a minimized set of mathematical expressions for designing a highly efficient primary side coil driver and for selecting the components of the secondary side impedance matching.

The system consists of a lightweight mechanical housing, a temperature regulating system, and a microfluidic bacterial inoculation channel. The overall system, which is less than 200 g, serves as a portable incubator for cell inoculation and can be mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle for monitoring remote and unreachable locations. The feedback control system maintains the inoculation temperature within 0.05 \u00b0C. The large surface-to-volume ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel facilitates effective gas exchange for rapid bacterial growth. Molecular dynamic simulation shows effective diffusion of major gas pollutants in PDMS toward gas sensing applications. By optimizing the design, we demonstrate the operation of the system in ambient temperatures from 5 \u00b0C to 32 \u00b0C and rapid bacterial growth in microchannels compared to standard bacterial culture techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2015.2478481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2015.2478481","startPage":"811","endPage":"817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7374759/07328305.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A UAV-Mounted Whole Cell Biosensor System for Environmental Monitoring Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A UAV-Mounted Whole Cell Biosensor System for Environmental Monitoring Applications","volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697455","pubMedId":"26584498","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328305/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"U01AI082457, R44AI088756, DP2OD007161 and ES06694"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A UAV-Mounted Whole Cell Biosensor System for Environmental Monitoring Applications","sourcePdf":"tnb-wong-2478481-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122444S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7374759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7374759","articleId":"7328305","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7328306,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjia Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, New York Institute of Technology, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7442200/7328306/li-2494017-small.gif","p":["\n\nWenjia Li (M'11) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the \nUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA, in 2011.","In August 2014, he joined the Department of Computer Science, New York Institute of Technology, New York, NY, USA, \nwhere he is currently an Assistant Professor.

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","startPage":"960","endPage":"969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7442200/07328306.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ART: An Attack-Resistant Trust Management Scheme for Securing Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"ART: An Attack-Resistant Trust Management Scheme for Securing Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15874641","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7328306/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ART: An Attack-Resistant Trust Management Scheme for Securing Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-li-2494017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077312S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7442200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"7442200","articleId":"7328306","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7328308,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Ten Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7556449/7328308/feng-2500235-small.gif","p":["Kai-Ten Feng (SM\u201911) received the BS degree from the National\n Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1992, the MS degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1996, and the\n PhD degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000.

To efficiently enhance network throughput, the concept of cognitive radio (CR) is adopted for LTE-A system to dynamically access opportunistic spectrum not occupied by primary system. Under the consideration of limited feedback system, the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is applied in this paper to estimate the channel occupancy information (COI) on shared spectrum by partially sensing the frequency carriers. A POMDP-based spectrum sharing (POSS) scheme is then proposed to realize throughput maximization via the designs of contention mechanism and resource allocation policy according to the partially observable COI, channel state information, and number of contending cells in the network. Compared with the exhaustive search, the proposed approach can achieve optimal performance gain with lower computational complexity, which is proved to be a linear time algorithm. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed POSS protocol can effectively improve system throughput on shared spectrum for the LTE-A networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16269315","htmlLink":"/document/7328308/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Design of Optimal Spectrum Sharing for Cognitive Radio-Enabled LTE-A Multi-Cell Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Top University and Elite Research Center Development Plan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"NSC","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-009-018-MY3"},{"fundingName":"National Chiao Tung University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003848","fundingName":"Industrial Technology Research Institute"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002875","fundingName":"Chunghwa Telecom Co.

Besides being confronted with update abnormality, denormalization has to consume additional storage space. As a result, this tactic is rarely used in main memory databases, which regards storage space, i.e., RAM, as scarce resource. Nevertheless, our research reveals that main memory database can benefit enormously from denormalization, as it is able to remarkably simplify the query processing plans and reduce the computation cost. In this paper, we present A-Store, a main memory OLAP engine customized for star/snowflake schemas. Instead of generating fully materialized denormalization, A-Store resorts to virtual denormalization by treating array indexes as primary keys. This design allows us to harvest the benefit of denormalization without sacrificing additional RAM space. A-Store uses a generic query processing model for all SPJGA queries. It applies a number of state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as vectorized scan and aggregation, to achieve superior performance. Our experiments show that A-Store outperforms the most prestigious MMDB systems significantly in star/snowflake schema based query processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7426466/07328310.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2015.2499199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2015.2499199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7426466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Denormalization via Array Index Reference for Main Memory OLAP","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Indexes","Query processing","Random access memory","Data models","Asia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data warehouses","optimisation","query processing","random-access storage","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual denormalization","array index reference","data warehouse","update abnormality","storage space","main memory database","scarce resource","query processing plan","computation cost","a-store","main memory OLAP engine","star/snowflake schema","RAM space","generic query processing model","SPJGA query","optimization method","vectorized scan","MMDB system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["main-memory","OLAP","denormalization","A-Store","array index"]},{"kwd":["Main-memory","OLAP","denormalization","A-Store","array index."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Denormalization via Array Index Reference for Main Memory OLAP","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7328310/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15823865","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA015307"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC Porject","grantNumber":"61272138"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research funds in Renmin University of China from the central government","grantNumber":"12XNQ072 and 13XNLF01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"HUAWEI Technologies CO., Ltd","grantNumber":"HIRP OPEN 20140510"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Denormalization via Array Index Reference for Main Memory OLAP","sourcePdf":"tkde-zhang-2499199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092642S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7426466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7426466","articleId":"7328310","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328311,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Azizpour","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Active Perception Lab (CVAP), Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7530937/7328311/azizpo-2500224-small.gif","p":["Hossein Azizpour received the BSc degree from Amirkabir University in\n 2008, and the MSc degree from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in 2011.

In the common scenario, a ConvNet is trained on a large labeled dataset (source) and the feed-forward units activation of the trained network, at a certain layer of the network, is used as a generic representation of an input image for a task with relatively smaller training set (target). Recent studies have shown this form of representation transfer to be suitable for a wide range of target visual recognition tasks. This paper introduces and investigates several factors affecting the transferability of such representations. It includes parameters for training of the source ConvNet such as its architecture, distribution of the training data, etc. and also the parameters of feature extraction such as layer of the trained ConvNet, dimensionality reduction, etc. Then, by optimizing these factors, we show that significant improvements can be achieved on various (17) visual recognition tasks. We further show that these visual recognition tasks can be categorically ordered based on their similarity to the source task such that a correlation between the performance of tasks and their similarity to the source task w.r.t. the proposed factors is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16191144","htmlLink":"/document/7328311/","pubMedId":"26584488","displayDocTitle":"Factors of Transferability for a Generic ConvNet Representation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100003392","fundingName":"Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research"},{"fundingName":"VINST"},{"fundingName":"CVPR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factors of Transferability for a Generic ConvNet Representation","sourcePdf":"tpami-azizpour-2500224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176308S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7328311","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328313,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Although this new electrical machine has many advantages such as high torque density, shorter axial length, and high efficiency, its mechanical construction is yet challenging. This is mostly due to the high axial force between the stator and the two rotors, which can be further increased by the inevitable manufacturing and assembly tolerances. Based on the determined geometric dimensions of the electromagnetically relevant components, a reliable mechanical construction is developed in this paper. Subsequently, stress, deformation, thermal, and modal analyses are performed based on finite-element method (FEM). Finally, the first prototype is successfully manufactured and measured. It can be concluded that the proposed construction is reliable and the measured data match well with the results of the electromagnetic analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15837356","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7328313/","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of a Yokeless and Segmented Armature Axial Flux Machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Yokeless and Segmented Armature Axial Flux Machine","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2500194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155715S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7328313","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7328317,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Masoumi Farahabadi","affiliation":["iCAS Laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7456352/7328317/farah-2488624-small.gif","p":["Payam Masoumi Farahabadi (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran.

A maximum saturated output power of 19.7 dBm is measured in HP mode while consuming 430 mW over a 1.2 V core supply. In low-power (LP) mode of operation, the power gain of 20 dB and 19.7 dBm saturated power is measured at 60 GHz.

With classic DES, the sensors independently transmit the sampled digitized data. However, the WSN is an uplink multiuser channel where multiple sources share the channel for communicating data to a Fusion Center (FC). To this aim, we adopt the optimal communication scheme for this setup that suggests interfering transmissions and the use of Successive Interference Cancelation (SIC) at the FC. We propose a joint SIC decoder and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) estimator for digital interfering transmission of correlated data. We further introduce an optimization framework that schedules and allocates power to the sensors optimally. We formulate the problem in two ways: an expected distortion minimization problem under a total power budget, and a transmission power minimization problem under a distortion constraint. For both cases, we consider the system performance under different operating conditions, and we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme compared to a system that employs optimized sensor selection under orthogonal transmissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328318/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837525","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks With an Interference Canceling Fusion Center","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks With an Interference Canceling Fusion Center","sourcePdf":"twc-argyriou-2500231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055062S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7328318","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7328319,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Fang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7328319/fang-2500261-small.gif","p":["Bing Fang (S'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, in 2003 and 2007, respectively, from PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the College of Communications Engineering.","His current research interests include optimization theory, machine learning, and game theory for signal processing and wireless communications.","Dr. Fang received the Best Paper Award at the 2014 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing."]},"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085450608"},{"name":"Wei Zhong","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7328319/zhong-2500261-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhong (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree from Guangzhou Institute of Communications, Guangzhou, China, in 2003; the M.Sc. degree from PLA University of Science and Technology (PLAUST), Nanjing, China, in 2006; and the Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2011.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST.

The system model considered here consists of a source, a relay, an information decoding (ID) receiver, and an energy harvesting (EH) receiver, all mounted with multiple antennas. Since full channel state information (CSI) is usually unavailable, a practical scenario, where only local CSI is required, is considered in this paper. Such a practical scenario naturally constitutes a noncooperative game, where the source and the relay can be regarded as two rational game players. With properly designed utilities, it can be further shown that the existence and uniqueness of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) of the proposed game can both be guaranteed under some mild conditions. Therefore, a distributed iterative precoding algorithm can be developed based on the best-response dynamic to obtain the unique NE solution for the proposed game. Moreover, a proximal-point-based regularization approach is also pursued to ensure the convergence of the proposed algorithm without requiring special restrictions on the channel ranks. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Results show that our algorithm can converge quickly to a satisfactory solution with guaranteed convergence.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07328319.pdf","startPage":"6940","endPage":"6948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2500261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2500261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game-Theoretic Precoding for SWIPT in the DF-Based MIMO Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Games","Heuristic algorithms","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decode and forward communication","decoding","energy harvesting","game theory","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game-theoretic precoding","DF-based MIMO relay networks","distributed precoding problem","simultaneous wireless information","power transfer","decode-and-forward networks","multiple-input-multiple-output networks","information decoding receiver","energy harvesting receiver","multiple antennas","channel state information","noncooperative game","rational game players","Nash equilibrium","distributed iterative precoding","proximal-point-based regularization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex optimization","energy harvesting (EH)","game theory","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) relay","precoder design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Game-Theoretic Precoding for SWIPT in the DF-Based MIMO Relay Networks","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7328319/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306004","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201218"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK2012056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M532207 and 2014T70966"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61531011 and 61450110445"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game-Theoretic Precoding for SWIPT in the DF-Based MIMO Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhong-2500261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095686S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7328319","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328320,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal A.

In a computational process called beamforming, a 3-D volume is reconstructed from several thousands of analog signals. Today's systems rely on massive analog preprocessing to reduce the computational burden of the subsequent digital processing system. In this paper, we present a configurable beamformer (BF) architecture, which demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to implement the entire 3-D delay and sum beamforming fully digitally and on one single chip, without requiring the off-chip memories. We present a presilicon implementation of a single-chip BF in an advanced 28-nm silicon-on-insulator technology. The BF targets a fully sampled 10k element 8-MHz bandwidth transducer head and is able to produce 298.1M focal points (FPs) per second-enough to produce a high-resolution volume with 16.3MFP at 15 Hz. All delays are computed online and on-chip to eliminate the power-hungry external memories for delay storage.

Unlike previous related works, minimum-rate constraints are imposed and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio takes a more general expression, which allows one to encompass some of the most promising 5G candidate technologies. Both network-centric and user-centric EE maximizations are considered. In the network-centric scenario, the maximization of the global EE and the minimum EE of the network is performed. Unlike previous contributions, we develop centralized algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, with affordable computational complexity, to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the considered non-convex optimization problems. Moreover, closed-form feasibility conditions are derived. In the user-centric scenario, game theory is used to study the equilibria of the network and to derive convergent power control algorithms, which can be implemented in a fully decentralized fashion. Both scenarios above are studied under the assumption that single or multiple resource blocks are employed for data transmission. Numerical results assess the performance of the proposed solutions, analyzing the impact of minimum-rate constraints, and comparing the network-centric and user-centric approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2500200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2500200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7410177/07328326.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Control: A Look at 5G Wireless Technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Control: A Look at 5G Wireless Technologies","volume":"64","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328326/","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15787072","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Power Control: A Look at 5G Wireless Technologies","sourcePdf":"tsp-zappone-2500200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.351521S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7328326","onlineDate":"12 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7328335,"authors":[{"name":"Otto Debals","affiliation":["iMinds Medical IT, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7422173/7328335/7328335-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Otto Debals (S\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering from KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2013.","He is a Ph.D. degree candidate affiliated with the Group Science, Engineering and Technology of Kulak, KU Leuven, with the STADIUS Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics of the Electrical Engineering Department (ESAT), KU Leuven, and with iMinds Medical IT.

The proposed approach exploits the advantage of adaptive mean-shift image clustering with aid of tone-mapping, yielding oversegmented strata that have uniform intensities and capture shapes of light regions. The resulted strata, however, have unbalanced importance metric values for rendering, and the strata number is not user-controlled. To handle these issues, we develop an adaptive split-and-merge scheme that refines the strata and obtains a better balanced strata distribution.

The VSSB signal is generated by electrically combining the baseband OFDM signals with sinusoidal waves without a frequency guard band to maximize the electrical and optical spectral efficiencies. The input-output relationship of the VSSB DD-OFDM system is represented and modeled as a second-order nonlinear kernel function by using the theory of Volterra series for the first time. The theory of Volterra inverse for the nonlinear system is introduced to analyze and mitigate subcarriers-to-subcarriers beating interference. In this paper, we further compare and analyze the inherent relationship between the iteration interference cancellation technique and Volterra postinverse equalizer, and that between symbol predistortion algorithm and Volterra preinverse equalizer. The analysis results show that the iteration interference cancellation technique can be considered as a second-order Volterra postinverse equalizer with iterative decision feedback, and symbol predistortion algorithm as a special designed second-order Volterra preinverse equalizer with iteration and step size control.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2495340","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7300504/07328672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2495340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300504","startPage":"4997","endPage":"5006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSBI Mitigation in A-RF-Tone-Based VSSB-OFDM System With a Frequency-Domain Volterra Series Equalizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SSBI Mitigation in A-RF-Tone-Based VSSB-OFDM System With a Frequency-Domain Volterra Series Equalizer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"23","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15645284","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571061"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSBI Mitigation in A-RF-Tone-Based VSSB-OFDM System With a Frequency-Domain Volterra Series Equalizer","sourcePdf":"jlt-ju-2495340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164952S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7300504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7300504","articleId":"7328672","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328680,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Arildsen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7389455/7328680/7328680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Arildsen (S'03\u2013M'04\u2013S'06\u2013M'10) received the M.Sc.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

The main reasons for using undersampling is that it reduces the path length and thereby the scanning time as well as the amount of interaction between the AFM probe and the specimen. It can easily be applied on conventional AFM hardware. Due to undersampling, it is necessary to subsequently process the acquired image in order to reconstruct an approximation of the image. Based on real AFM cell images, our simulations reveal that using a simple raster scanning pattern in combination with conventional image interpolation performs very well. Moreover, this combination enables a reduction by a factor 10 of the scanning time while retaining an average reconstruction quality around 36 dB PSNR on the tested cell images.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7389455/07328680.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"31","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction Algorithms in Undersampled AFM Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction Algorithms in Undersampled AFM Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328680/","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7328680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15728222","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction Algorithms in Undersampled AFM Imaging","sourcePdf":"jstsp-arildsen-2500363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191176S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7389455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7389455","articleId":"7328680","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328683,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Straullu","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Stefano Straullu received the Graduate degree in telecommunications\n engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 2005, with a thesis on the realization and testing of\n opto-electronic subsystems for packet-switched optical networks, completed in the PhotonLab of Istituto Superiore\n Mario Boella, Turin; and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Politecnico di Torino,\n Turin, with a thesis on next-generation passive optical networks.

Of interest in the present paper is the evaluation of the OC at the output of the Equal Gain Combining (EGC) and the Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receivers. In this case, it can be seen that this problem turns out to be that of computing the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the sum of independent random variables. Since finding a closed-form expression for the CDF of the sum distribution is out of reach for a wide class of commonly used distributions, methods based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations take pride of price. In order to allow for the estimation of the operating range of small outage probabilities, it is of paramount importance to develop fast and efficient estimation methods as naive MC simulations would require high computational complexity. In this line, we propose in this work two unified, yet efficient, hazard rate twisting Importance Sampling (IS) based approaches that efficiently estimate the OC of MRC or EGC diversity techniques over generalized independent fading channels. The first estimator is shown to possess the asymptotic optimality criterion and applies for arbitrary fading models, whereas the second one achieves the well-desired bounded relative error property for the majority of the well-known fading variates. Moreover, the second estimator is shown to achieve the asymptotic optimality property under the particular Log-normal environment. Some selected simulation results are finally provided in order to illustrate the substantial computational gain achieved by the proposed IS schemes over naive MC simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2500201","startPage":"376","endPage":"388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7406776/07328688.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Importance Sampling Schemes for Efficient Simulation of Outage Capacity Over Generalized Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Unified Importance Sampling Schemes for Efficient Simulation of Outage Capacity Over Generalized Fading Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328688/","accessionNumber":"15786073","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328688/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Importance Sampling Schemes for Efficient Simulation of Outage Capacity Over Generalized Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"jstsp-kammoun-2500201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105463S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7406776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7406776","articleId":"7328688","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7328695,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Ding (S'13\u2013M'15) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.","During 2005\u20132007, he studied in the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based splitting method is proposed. First, the graph theory is employed to transform the splitting problem into a graph partition problem. Then, the graph partition problem is modeled as an MILP optimization problem with consideration to the network connectivity of all subgraphs. The MILP-based splitting strategy can be efficiently computed with existing commercial solvers, and the multiple optimal solutions can be captured with the recursive process. Compared with the splitting methods in the literature, the proposed method is more flexible and efficient, such that the users can select the optimal solution from multiple solutions with different interests and heuristic splitting rules (e.g., with the minimum amount of switched lines). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified with IEEE 30-, 118-, and 300-bus test systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2493880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8323440/07328695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2493880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323440","startPage":"350","endPage":"359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming-Based Splitting Strategies for Power System Islanding Operation Considering Network Connectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328695","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4267003/8323440/7328695-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming-Based Splitting Strategies for Power System Islanding Operation Considering Network Connectivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17665734","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7328695/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577147"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002412","fundingName":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"EIPE14106"},{"fundingName":"Engineering Research Center of the National Science Foundation (NSF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"EEC-1041877"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming-Based Splitting Strategies for Power System Islanding Operation Considering Network Connectivity","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ding-2493880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091988S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8323440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8323440","articleId":"7328695","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328699,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Ros\u00e1rio","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Ros\u00e1rio","id":"37085704134"},{"name":"Francisco A.

Unlike mechanical systems, the homogeneity of the fault modes is quite low for electronic systems. Seen at the system level, there are also multiple and uncertain fault modes for electronic products. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for system-level SOH assessment and RUL estimation inspired by the quantum mechanics disciplines, where there is no requirement to distinguish the fault modes from the fault development patterns. It is developed on the analogy that the healthy data points tend to move to the lower potential energy positions, and the subhealthy or unhealthy ones tend to be repelled from such positions. The fault development paths are located on the potential surface. The Fermi-Dirac health descriptor (FDHD) is defined based on the pseudowave function and potential function. Based on FDHD, the SOH assessment and RUL estimation algorithm are developed to track the existing fault development paths. Finally, the proposed method is verified in an experiment using power conversion board with a detailed analysis of the SOH assessment results and RUL estimation performances.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2500199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7428980/07328705.pdf","startPage":"2379","endPage":"2390","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2500199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Assimilation-Based State-of-Health Assessment and Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Electronic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Assimilation-Based State-of-Health Assessment and Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Electronic Systems","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7328705/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837351","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Assimilation-Based State-of-Health Assessment and Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Electronic Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-cui-2500199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070673S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7328705","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7328707,"authors":[{"name":"Galymzhan Nauryzbayev","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Galymzhan Nauryzbayev (S\u201913) received the B.Sc.

Finally, we generalize the proposed method to the L -cell case and consider the impact of different antenna configurations to maintain the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Multiplexing Gain Using Interference Alignment Cancellation in Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2500583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7360961/07328707.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2500583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Multiplexing Gain Using Interference Alignment Cancellation in Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7328707/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Multiplexing Gain Using Interference Alignment Cancellation in Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-nauryzbayev-2500583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17814S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7360961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7360961","articleId":"7328707","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328713,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ying Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong","Institute of Antenna and Microwave Techniques, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Li Ying","lastName":"Feng","id":"37632285600"},{"name":"Kwok Wa Leung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kwok Wa","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279720400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7328713","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Dielectric resonator antennas","Microwave antennas","Reflector antennas","Microwave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","Fabry-Perot resonators","microwave resonators","millimetre wave antennas","millimetre wave resonators","multifrequency antennas","UHF antennas","UHF resonators","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large frequency ratio","compact dual-frequency folded-parallel-plate antenna","microwave parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna","WRA","millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna","FPRA","hook-shaped strip","half-ring sleeve","ISM band","ANSYS HFSS","S-parameter","antenna radiation pattern","antenna gain","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 24 EHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-frequency antenna","parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna","Fabry-Perot resonator antenna","low profile antenna"]},{"kwd":["Dual-frequency antenna","fabry-perot resonator antenna (FPRA)","low-profile antenna","parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna (WRA)"]}],"abstract":"This communication investigates a new compact dual-frequency antenna with a large frequency ratio, which consists of a pair of folded parallel plates. It integrates the microwave parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna (WRA) with the millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna (FPRA), with their resonant frequencies independent of each other. Due to the folded structure, the profile of the proposed antenna is lower than that of the conventional parallel-plate WRA. The WRA part is excited by a hook-shaped strip on its top, whereas the FPRA is excited by an L-probe with a half-ring sleeve. To demonstrate the idea, a dual-frequency antenna that covers the 2.4- and 24-GHz ISM bands was designed. ANSYS HFSS was used to simulate the S-parameters, radiation pattern, and antenna gain and reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Frequency Folded-Parallel-Plate Antenna With Large Frequency Ratio","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2500607","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7369997/07328713.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2500607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7369997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Frequency Folded-Parallel-Plate Antenna With Large Frequency Ratio","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7328713/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685585","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC/GRF Joint Research project","grantNumber":"N_CityU134/13"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Frequency Folded-Parallel-Plate Antenna With Large Frequency Ratio","sourcePdf":"tap-feng-2500607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072449S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7369997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7369997","articleId":"7328713","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328715,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Hadzi-Velkov","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Ss.

These employ \u201charvest then transmit\u201d mechanism, as they spend all of their energy harvested during the previous BS energy broadcast to transmit the information towards the BS. Assuming time division multiple access (TDMA), we propose a novel transmission scheme for jointly optimal allocation of the BS broadcasting power and time sharing among the wireless nodes, which maximizes the overall network throughput, under the constraint of average transmit power and maximum transmit power at the BS. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms \u201cstate of the art\u201d schemes that employ only the optimal time allocation. If a single EH transmitter is considered, we generalize the optimal solutions for the case of fixed circuit power consumption, which refers to a much more practical scenario.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2500340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2500340","startPage":"50","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7314997/07328715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Networks with Energy Harvesting and Power Transfer: Joint Power and Time Allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Networks with Energy Harvesting and Power Transfer: Joint Power and Time Allocation","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15597980","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7328715/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Networks with Energy Harvesting and Power Transfer: Joint Power and Time Allocation","sourcePdf":"lsp-hadzivelkov-2500340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058016S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7314997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7314997","articleId":"7328715","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7328725,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085625992"},{"name":"Hongcheng Zhuang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hongcheng","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37396297900"},{"name":"Zezhou Luo","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zezhou","lastName":"Luo","id":"37538022600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7328725","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nickel","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Load modeling","Fading","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense OFDM networks","network densification","5G system","energy saving","resource utility","MIMO-OFDM system","energy optimization problem","convex program method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dense Network","MIMO-OFDM","load factor"]},{"kwd":["Dense Network","MIMO-OFDM","load factor"]}],"abstract":"Network densification is a promising technology to increase 5G system capacity.

First, we show that for single-antenna scenario, this problem can be transformed into a convex problem, which can be solved more efficiently comparing with the existing methods.

New methods and applications that use the device generally require an appropriately large ensemble of data sets with accompanying ground truth for testing purposes, as well as accurate models that account for the various systematic and stochastic contributors to Kinect errors. Current error models, however, overlook the intermediate infrared (IR) images that directly contribute to noisy depth estimates. We, therefore, propose a high fidelity Kinect IR and depth image predictor and simulator that models the physics of the transmitter/receiver system, unique IR dot pattern, disparity/depth processing technology, and random intensity speckle and IR noise in the detectors. The model accounts for important characteristics of Kinect's stereo triangulation system, including depth shadowing, IR dot splitting, spreading, and occlusions, correlation-based disparity estimation between windows of measured and reference IR images, and subpixel refinement. Results show that the simulator accurately produces axial depth error from imaged flat surfaces with various tilt angles, as well as the bias and standard lateral error of an object's horizontal and vertical edge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"46","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16465649","pubMedId":"26584505","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7328728/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simulating Kinect Infrared and Depth Images","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Simulating Kinect Infrared and Depth Images","sourcePdf":"tcyb-landau-2494877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093729S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7328728","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7328729,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7328729/juzhu-2500578-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhu (S\u201910) was born in Nanjing, China.

The channel state information of the eavesdropper is assumed to be unavailable at the BS and hence, linear precoding of data and artificial noise (AN) are employed for secrecy enhancement. Four different data precoders (i.e., selfish zero-forcing (ZF)/regularized channel inversion (RCI) and collaborative ZF/RCI precoders) and three different AN precoders (i.e., random, selfish/collaborative null-space-based precoders) are investigated and the corresponding achievable ergodic secrecy rates are analyzed. Our analysis includes the effects of uplink channel estimation, pilot contamination, multicell interference, and path-loss. Furthermore, to strike a balance between complexity and performance, linear precoders that are based on matrix polynomials are proposed for both data and AN precoding. The polynomial coefficients of the data and AN precoders are optimized, respectively, for minimization of the sum-mean-squared-error of and the AN leakage to the mobile terminals in the cell of interest using tools from free probability and random matrix theory. Our analytical and simulation results provide interesting insights for the design of secure multicell massive MIMO systems and reveal that the proposed polynomial data and AN precoders closely approach the performance of selfish RCI data and null-space-based AN precoders, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"15","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15837495","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7328729/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoding of Data and Artificial Noise in Secure Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"STPGP 396545-10"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Program"},{"fundingName":"German Science Foundation","grantNumber":"SCHO 831/5-1"},{"fundingName":"European Wireless Conference"},{"fundingName":"International Symposium on Communications, Control, and Signal Processing (ISCCSP)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoding of Data and Artificial Noise in Secure Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-zhu-2500578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.381323S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7328729","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7328732,"authors":[{"name":"Alhassan Khedr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7534965/7328732/khedr-2500576-small.gif","p":["Alhassan Khedr received the BSc and MSc degrees from the Electronics\n and Electrical Communications Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2008\n and 2011, respectively.

Although this system was widely believed to be less efficient than its contemporaries, we demonstrate quite the opposite behavior for a large class of applications. We first highlight and carefully exploit the algebraic features of the system to achieve significant speedup over the state-of-the-art HE implementation, namely the IBM homomorphic encryption library (HElib). We introduce several optimizations on top of our HE implementation, and use the resulting scheme to construct a homomorphic Bayesian spam filter, secure multiple keyword search, and a homomorphic evaluator for binary decision trees.

In particular, we analyze the effect of the noisy estimation of the main CSI on the throughput of a broadcast channel where the transmission is intended for multiple legitimate receivers in the presence of an eavesdropper. Besides, we consider the realistic case where the transmitter is only aware of the statistics of the eavesdropper's CSI and not of its channel's realizations. First, we discuss the common message transmission case where the source broadcasts the same information to all the receivers, and we provide an upper and a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity. For this case, we show that the secrecy rate is limited by the legitimate receiver having, on average, the worst main channel link and we prove that a nonzero secrecy rate can still be achieved even when the CSI at the transmitter is noisy. Then, we look at the independent messages case where the transmitter broadcasts multiple messages to the receivers, and each intended user is interested in an independent message. For this case, we present an expression for the achievable secrecy sum-rate and an upper bound on the secrecy sum-capacity and we show that, in the limit of large number of legitimate receivers K, our achievable secrecy sum-rate follows the scaling law log ((1-\u03b1)log(K)), where \u03b1 is the estimation error variance of the main CSI. The special cases of high SNR, perfect and no-main CSI are also analyzed. Analytical derivations and numerical results are presented to illustrate the obtained expressions for the case of independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","volume":"15","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"15837528","publicationDate":"March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328736/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure Broadcasting With Imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-603-2-243"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Broadcasting With Imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter","sourcePdf":"twc-hyadi-2500563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084856S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7328736","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328740,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Biral","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687308/7390341/7328740/biral-2500569-small.gif","p":["Andrea Biral (SM\u201915) received the Laurea degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2012.

This allows us to define a simple way to simulate the \u201cmacroscopic\u201d evolution of the microfluidic network, predicting the path followed by the droplets in the circuits. To validate the model, we compare the simulation results with the experimental outcomes we obtained from a simple but representative microfluidic circuit, which has been realized in our laboratory, and with other circuits tested in previous works. Finally, we apply our theoretical model to a more complex usecase, consisting in a microfluidic network with bus topology, and we draw some final considerations about the performance of such a network.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2500569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2500569","startPage":"122","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/7390341/07328740.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7390341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Networks","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15730323","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328740/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Padova project \u201cMicrofluidic Networking (MiNET): introducing networking technologies in microfluidic systems\u201d","grantNumber":"CPDA127793/12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Networks","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-zanella-2500569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112075S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"7390341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7390341","articleId":"7328740","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7328741,"authors":[{"name":"Junli Liang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, School of Electronics and Information, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7404064/7328741/7328741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junli Liang (M\u201912) was born in China.

Our solution is based on the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN), which is an analog neural computational technique for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems according to the Lagrange multiplier theory. The local stability of the proposed positioning algorithm is also investigated. Furthermore, we have extended the LPNN based approach to more challenging scenarios, namely, when time synchronization among all antennas cannot be fulfilled, and there are position uncertainties in the MIMO radar transmit and receive elements. The optimality of the developed algorithms is demonstrated by comparing with the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound via computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7404064/07328741.pdf","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2500881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2500881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lagrange Programming Neural Network Approach for Target Localization in Distributed MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Neurons","MIMO radar","Radar antennas","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","neural nets","radar computing","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lagrange programming neural network approach","distributed MIMO radar","source localization","distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar","bistatic range measurements","positioning algorithm","LPNN based approach","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bistatic range","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions","Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","nonlinear constrained optimization","target localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Lagrange Programming Neural Network Approach for Target Localization in Distributed MIMO Radar","volume":"64","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7328741/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785920","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Henry Fork Fund","grantNumber":"141119"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61172123 and 61471295"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lagrange Programming Neural Network Approach for Target Localization in Distributed MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-liang-2500881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094851S","chronDate":"March15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7404064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7404064","articleId":"7328741","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328743,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Majidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7857818/7328743/majid-2493545-small.gif","p":["Mehrdad Majidi (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the Power and Water University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Unlike earlier conventional fault location methods, we only require capturing the phasors in a limited number of buses by phasor measurement units (PMUs). The measured voltage phasors and impedance matrix of the system yield an underdetermined system of equations that can be solved by sparse representation recovery methods. The solution gives a sparse fault current vector whose nonzero elements assign the probable faulty zones. For areas with no faults, current phasors measured by PMUs are sufficiently accurate to calculate the adjacent bus voltages. The new calculated voltages and the measured data are used to estimate the faulted lines accurately. The substitution theorem and least-squares method are used to calculate the differences between pre- and during-fault voltages, and currents in both ends of the faulted lines. Transmission line equations developed based on distributed line parameters are then used to pinpoint the fault location along each faulted line. We demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our noniterative methodology and its low computational load using simulations of the IEEE 39-bus test system with noisy measurements, multiple combinations of all fault types, and different resistances.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/7857818/7328743-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328743/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16690072","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Sparse-Data-Driven Approach for Fault Location in Transmission Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIA-1301726"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Sparse-Data-Driven Approach for Fault Location in Transmission Networks","sourcePdf":"tsg-etezadiamoli-2493545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115004S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7857818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7857818","articleId":"7328743","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7328744,"authors":[{"name":"Yunquan Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7328744/ydong-2500566-small.gif","p":["Yunquan Dong (M\u201915) received the Master\u2019s degree in communication and information system from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, and the Ph.D degree in communication and information engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2008 and 2014, respectively.

In particular, the number of users in each small cell can change dramatically due to users' mobility, resulting in random and time varying uplink interference. This paper considers the uplink interference in a 5G heterogeneous network, which is jointly covered by one macro cell and several small cells. Based on the L\u00e9vy flight moving model, a mobility-aware interference model is proposed to characterize the uplink interference from macro cell users to small cell users. In this model, the total uplink interference is characterized by its moment generating function, for both closed subscriber group (CSG) and open subscriber group (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed interference model is a function of basic step length, which is a key velocity parameter of L\u00e9vy flights. It is shown by both theoretical analysis and simulation results that the proposed interference model provides a flexible way of evaluating the system performance in terms of success probability and average rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837519","htmlLink":"/document/7328744/","displayDocTitle":"Mobility-Aware Uplink Interference Model for 5G Heterogeneous Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Major State Basic Research Development Program (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61171064 and 61021001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004407","fundingName":"Foundation from Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility-Aware Uplink Interference Model for 5G Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-fan-2500566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117214S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7328744","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7328754,"authors":[{"name":"Vida Vakilian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Bakersfield, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7328754/vakil-2500604-small.gif","p":["Vida Vakilian (M'11) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2014.","From April to September 2011, she was a Visiting Scholar with the University of California, Davis, CA, USA, where she worked on analyzing and investigating the performance of reconfigurable multiple-input\u2013multiple-output systems in spatially correlated frequency-selective fading channels.

We assume that the antenna elements at the transmitter are reconfigurable and capable of independently changing the physical characteristics of their radiation patterns. The composite right-left handed leaky-wave antenna is an example of reconfigurable antennas with such characteristics. We use this feature of the antennas and develop a block coding scheme that exploits, in addition to the spatial and frequency diversity, a new additional degree of diversity, which is called state diversity. We determine the maximum achievable diversity order of the proposed coding scheme in spatially correlated frequency-selective channels. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed block coding technique, we provide numerical results and compare them with those of the previously developed coding schemes for MIMO-OFDM systems. The results indicate that the proposed code achieves significantly higher diversity and coding gain, even in spatially correlated channels, compared with the existing counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2500604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07328754.pdf","startPage":"7207","endPage":"7218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2500604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Increasing the Slow-Fading Channel Diversity Using Block-Coded MIMO-OFDM With Reconfigurable Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328754/","displayDocTitle":"On Increasing the Slow-Fading Channel Diversity Using Block-Coded MIMO-OFDM With Reconfigurable Antennas","volume":"65","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306030","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328754/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Increasing the Slow-Fading Channel Diversity Using Block-Coded MIMO-OFDM With Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tvt-vakilian-2500604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157284S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7328754","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328755,"authors":[{"name":"Xiyuan Wang","affiliation":["Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7404064/7328755/7328755-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiyuan Wang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in control sciences and engineering from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013.","He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Science and Technology Beijing.

We first study the secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem in the case of complete channel state information (CSI). The rank-1 relay beamformer, which has been solved in our previous work in \u201cSecure relay beamforming with imperfect channel side information,\u201d IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 62, no. 5, pp. 2140-2155, June 2013, is rigorously proved to be globally optimal. Then, we turn to the case of partial eavesdropper's CSI (ECSI), where the uncertainty of ECSI is characterized as a bounded region, and study the worst-case secrecy rate maximization (WCSRM) problem. Different from the common spherical uncertainty region, the uncertainty region adopted in our paper imposes independent constraints on the channel gain and direction. With the proposed uncertainty region, we give an in-depth analysis of the WCSRM problem. We solve the rank-1 relay beamformer in an explicit form and move a step further by establishing the sufficient conditions for the global optimality of the rank-1 solution. Besides, the rank-2 relay beamformer with a special singular value decomposition (SVD) structure is also considered. By reducing the optimization variables into single variable, we show that the proposed rank-2 solution can be solved by simple line search. The asymptotic optimality of the proposed rank-2 relay beamformer in the high relay power region is also proved under mild conditions. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the analysis in the paper.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2500879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404064","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7404064/07328755.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Beamforming for Multiple-Antenna Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328755/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Secure Beamforming for Multiple-Antenna Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785917","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Beamforming for Multiple-Antenna Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2500879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129596S","chronDate":"March15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7404064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7404064","articleId":"7328755","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328757,"authors":[{"name":"Chiara Ravazzi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7404064/7328757/7328757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiara Ravazzi (M\u201913) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in applied mathematics from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Associate with the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications (DET), Politecnico di Torino.

In this paper, we consider the in-network minimization of a continuously differentiable nonlinear function which is a combination of local agent objective functions subject to sparsity constraints on the variables. A crucial issue of in-network optimization is the handling of the communications, which may be expensive. This calls for efficient algorithms, that are able to reduce the number of required communication links and transmitted messages. To this end, we focus on asynchronous and randomized distributed techniques. Based on consensus techniques and iterative hard thresholding methods, we propose three methods that attempt to minimize the given function, promoting sparsity of the solution: asynchronous hard thresholding (AHT), broadcast hard thresholding (BHT), and gossip hard thresholding (GHT). Although similar in many aspects, it is difficult to obtain a unified analysis for the proposed algorithms. Specifically, we theoretically prove the convergence and characterize the limit points of AHT in regular networks under some proper assumptions on the functions to be minimized. For BHT and GHT, instead, we characterize the fixed points of the maps that rule their dynamics in terms of stationary points of original problem. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of our techniques in compressed sensing and present several numerical results on performance and number of transmissions required for convergence.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2500887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7404064/07328757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2500887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Algorithms for Distributed Nonlinear Optimization Under Sparsity Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Algorithms for Distributed Nonlinear Optimization Under Sparsity Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328757/","volume":"64","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7328757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785914","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Algorithms for Distributed Nonlinear Optimization Under Sparsity Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-fosson-2500887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13615S","chronDate":"March15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7404064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7404064","articleId":"7328757","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328759,"authors":[{"name":"Adarsh Patel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7404064/7328759/7328759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adarsh Patel (S\u201912) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Integral University, Lucknow, India, in 2008 and the M.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering (digital communication) from ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and management, Gwalior, in 2010.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

Subsequently, for a scenario with unknown CSI uncertainty statistics, we develop a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based composite hypothesis robust detector (CHRD) for spectrum sensing.

Further, a deflection coefficient based optimization framework is also developed and solved to derive closed form expressions for the optimal beacon sequences.

The ET PA delivers a higher efficiency and a better linearity than the stand-alone PA, simultaneously. However, the ET PA generates spectral regrowth at a far-out spurious emission domain. The noise sources are analyzed, and the noise effects on a RF PA are estimated using mathematical models of the RF PA and supply modulator. To reduce the noise, a wideband supply modulator is designed using 40-nm CMOS process for a high speed operation, and an additional capacitor is connected to the supply line of the PA. These noise reduction techniques significantly reduce the far-out spurious noise of the ET PA to a level similar to that of the stand-alone PA. For a 10-MHz bandwidth and 6.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio long term evolution signal, the ET PA delivers a power-added efficiency of 41.8%, a gain of 23.8 dB, and an evolved universal terrestrial radio access adjacent channel leakage ratio of -34.3 dBc at an average output power of 27 dBm and an operating frequency of 1.85 GHz. The noise power spectrum densities of the ET PA are -130.3/-133.7 dBm/Hz at 1.93/1.99 GHz, respectively, which is limited by our PA itself.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328764/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15635429","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Far-Out Spurious Noise and its Reduction in Envelope-Tracking Power Amplifier","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IT RaD program of MOTIEKEIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Far-Out Spurious Noise and its Reduction in Envelope-Tracking Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2495178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071285S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7343772","articleId":"7328764","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7328766,"authors":[{"name":"Jinil Chung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7407434/7328766/7328766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinil Chung (S'13) received B.S. and M.S. degrees from Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

These DSP units are dominated by sequential memory access where SRAM-based memory or flip-flop based shift registers are inefficient in terms of area and power. We propose spintronic domain wall memory (DWM) based embedded memories for DSP building blocks such as survivor-path memories and last-in first-out (LIFO) in Viterbi decoder, first-in-first-out (FIFO) register files in FFT processor and bitonic sorter, and input register of distributed arithmetic (DA) based FIR filter that exploit the unique serial access mechanism, non-volatility and small footprint of the memory for area and power saving. Simulations using 65 nm technology show that the DWM based design achieves significant area and power savings over the conventional SRAM and spin-transfer-torque RAM (STTRAM) based design approach. For 8 k-point FFT processor and Viterbi decoder, the DWM-based design shows 60.6% (8.4%) and 66.4% ( -1.7%) area and 60.3% (44.3%) and 60.0% (37.8%) power savings over the conventional SRAM (STTRAM) based design, respectively.

Since the proposed radar does not require an illumination source, radio interference does not occur. To study parametrically the effect of the signal parameters on radar detection performance, a simulation was carried out by modeling the radar system in the discrete-time domain, and the results were verified experimentally using an actuator. In demonstrated applications, the radar uses an input 20 MHz Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signal or captures an ambient Wi-Fi signal to detect several gestures quite successfully.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gesture Sensing Using Retransmitted Wireless Communication Signals Based on Doppler Radar Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2495298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7343796/07328769.pdf","startPage":"4592","endPage":"4602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2495298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Gesture Sensing Using Retransmitted Wireless Communication Signals Based on Doppler Radar Technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7328769/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15635471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-110-013-MY3 and MOST 103-2221-E-110-016-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gesture Sensing Using Retransmitted Wireless Communication Signals Based on Doppler Radar Technology","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wang-2495298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084713S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7343796","articleId":"7328769","onlineDate":"13 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7328771,"authors":[{"name":"Shirin Montazeri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7328771/7328771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shirin Montazeri (S\u201914) was born in Ahvaz, Iran, on April 7, 1991.

This paper proposes a bidding strategy for the aggregator to maximize its profits from participating in competitive energy and different regulating reserves markets, while compensating EV owners for degradation.

The technique allows a high spectral efficiency even with low order modulation formats. The transmission was successfully performed on an installed link between Milan and Finkenstein (Austria) in a loop back configuration, which included 2 \u00d7660 km of ITU-T G.655 fiber. The superchannel is composed by eight subchannels with low-level modulation format, i.e. polarization multiplexed (PM)-quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The use of low order modulation format guarantee better robustness in terms of optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) and reduced complexity with respect to higher order formats. Coherent detection was used together with iterative maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detection and decoding at the receiver. A 992 Gb/s PM-QPSK superchannel was successfully transmitted between Milan-Finkenstein-Milan with a spectral efficiency (SE) of 6.2 bit/s/Hz. Long term measurements confirm the system reliability.","doi":"10.1109/PS.2015.7328940","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307878/7328918/07328940.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PS.2015.7328940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time frequency packed DP-QPSK superchannel field trial transmission over installed link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328940/","displayDocTitle":"Time frequency packed DP-QPSK superchannel field trial transmission over installed link","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601386","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328940/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time frequency packed DP-QPSK superchannel field trial transmission over installed link","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570167235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072864S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307878","isNumber":"7328918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307878","xplore-issue":"7328918","articleId":"7328940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328946,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Pelusi","affiliation":["IPOS, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Pelusi","id":"37319555800"},{"name":"Karen Solis-Trapala","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Solis-Trapala","id":"37074145300"},{"name":"Hung Nguyen Tan","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hung Nguyen","lastName":"Tan","id":"38195161000"},{"name":"Takashi Inoue","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37085369629"},{"name":"Shu Namiki","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Namiki","id":"37085368525"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8821-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8820-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7328946","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical wavelength conversion","Laser excitation","Phase modulation","Optical noise","Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","multiwave mixing","optical wavelength conversion","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDM 16-QAM signals","co-phase dithered pump","broadband wavelength conversion","degenerate four-wave mixing","single CW laser","FWM conversion efficiency","signal demodulation","bit error rate","forward error correction","OSNR penalty","bit rate 256 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber optics communications","Nonlinear optical signal processing","Phase modulation"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate broadband wavelength conversion of a 256 Gb/s PDM 16-QAM signal using degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) pumped by a single CW laser.

In future elastic optical network, the network operation is more adaptive and reconfigurable. The OPM monitoring information retrieved at each intermediate node would be useful for optimal network control. Common OPM parameters in an optical transmission system, include optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), accumulated chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). In this paper, we present our OPM techniques for these three parameters, based on signal correlation procedures on one or a few pilot subcarriers inserted in the spectrum of an optical OFDM signal, which is one of the promising signal format to support the future elastic optical networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307878/7328918/07328981.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","doi":"10.1109/PS.2015.7328981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PS.2015.7328981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical performance monitoring in elastic optical OFDM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","OFDM","High-speed optical techniques","Optical fiber networks","Optical receivers","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic optical networks","PMD","polarization mode dispersion","CD","chromatic dispersion","OSNR","optical signal-to-noise ratio","optical transmission system","optical signals","network management","elastic optical OFDM networks","optical performance monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical performance monitoring","elastic optical networks","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optical performance monitoring in elastic optical OFDM networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7328981/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601347","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical performance monitoring in elastic optical OFDM networks","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570165923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307878","isNumber":"7328918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307878","xplore-issue":"7328918","articleId":"7328981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7328988,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o P.

The presented equalizer is a part of a digital signal processing (DSP) system designed to be applied in a 400 Gbps dual polarization optical intradyne coherent system using 16-QAM modulation format. The whole DSP system is composed of the Automatic Frequency control (AFC) module, Bulk dispersion compensation module, FFE and a symbol-by-symbol detector. FFE is devoted to the compensation of linear effects due to the propagation along the fiber as group velocity dispersion (GVD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). The proposed solution for equalizer implementation has been ad hoc designed and optimized in order to minimize hardware occupancy. This architecture allows to reduce the number of look-up tables (LUTs) of more than 40% respect to standard implementation, reaching a minimum value of 2.052.864 LUTs corresponding approximately to one FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/PS.2015.7328994","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (PS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307878/7328918/07328994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PS.2015.7328994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328918","startPage":"184","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On real-time implementaion of 400 Gbps dual polarization 16-QAM coherent intradyne receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7328994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On real-time implementaion of 400 Gbps dual polarization 16-QAM coherent intradyne receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7328994/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601367","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7328994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On real-time implementaion of 400 Gbps dual polarization 16-QAM coherent intradyne receiver","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570166061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029789S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307878","isNumber":"7328918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307878","xplore-issue":"7328918","articleId":"7328994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329015,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Guan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Guan","id":"37085608949"},{"name":"Tianwai Bo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Tianwai","lastName":"Bo","id":"37085357000"},{"name":"Calvin Chun-Kit Chan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Calvin Chun-Kit","lastName":"Chan","id":"37280784300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8821-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8820-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329015","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Optical switches","Interference","Phase noise","Frequency modulation","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","laser noise","multiplexing","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-carrier interference","carrier frequency offset","CO-OFDM systems","laser phase noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inter-carrier interference","laser phase noise","residual carrier frequency offset"]}],"abstract":"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel method to mitigate the inter-carrier interference (ICI) induced by laser phase noise in CO-OFDM systems.

However, the need for a high data transfer rate from the hardware front end to the software back end is a major technical challenge. To mitigate this issue, a micro-beamforming approach can be used to reduce the data size by pre-steering and summing the channel data over small sub-apertures. However, grating lobes and other artifacts may appear and degrade image quality. In this study, we propose a modified micro-beamforming approach to achieve real-time data compression while minimizing the artifacts. First, the RF data are converted to baseband and micro-beamforming is only applied to the amplitude data while the phase data is unchanged. Second, a compensation factor is used and applied to the subaperture amplitude beam sum at the software back end. Results show that the proposed approach can be implemented in real-time with minimal compression errors.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0076","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329058.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0076","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time channel data compression for improved software beamforming using microbeamforming with error compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time channel data compression for improved software beamforming using microbeamforming with error compensation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329058/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615367","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time channel data compression for improved software beamforming using microbeamforming with error compensation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112847S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329059,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37410431600"},{"name":"Zong-Ru Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Zong-Ru Yang","id":"37085714694"},{"name":"Yi-Shang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Shang Wang","id":"37085719487"},{"name":"Chih-Chung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chung","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085390953"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329059","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Clocks","Computer architecture","Imaging","Image resolution","Transducers","Ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","biomedical electronics","biomedical ultrasonics","CMOS integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","portable instruments","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-digital high-resolution transmit-beamforming ASIC","high-frequency portable ultrasound imaging systems","field programmable gate arrays","delay resolution","FPGA chip size","all-digital delay-locked loop","beamforming delay line","interpolation delay","CMOS technology","high-frequency linear array","frequency 30 MHz","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beamforer","high-frequency ultrasound imaging system","ASIC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an all-digital and high-resolution transmit-beamforming circuit for high-frequency ultrasound imaging systems is presented.

Lowering the acquisition time would be beneficial; however, this is limited by the time of flight and the number of transmission events. Moreover, corruption of the measurements by noise may cause inverse scattering reconstruction methods such as the Born Iterative Method (BIM) to converge to a wrong solution. Beamforming using multiple elements to obtain a narrow beam has the potential to mitigate the effects of noise; however, spatial coverage per transmission event reduces in this case. To excite the full domain, more transmissions are required and the acquisition time increases even further. We therefore consider compressive acquisitions based on parallel randomized transmissions from a circular array. Relying on the assumption that the object is compressible, we combine the BIM with sparse reconstruction to obtain the estimated image.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0158","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329068.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for beamformed Ultrasound computed tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329068/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for beamformed Ultrasound computed tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615370","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329068/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for beamformed Ultrasound computed tomography","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074806S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329097,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085638697"},{"name":"Qiong He","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"He","id":"37085436256"},{"name":"Jianwen Luo","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Luo","id":"37278981900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"In this paper, the previously proposed compressed sensing based synthetic transmit aperture (CS-STA) was compared with synthetic transmit aperture (STA), multi-element synthetic transmit aperture (ME-STA) and the conventional focused mode in two different phantoms.

This high aggregate data rate (typically exceeding 30 Gb/s) is holding back the design of imagers with high transducer counts, such as 2D imaging arrays. Prior work has demonstrated sub-Nyquist sampling techniques in software, which take advantage of the low innovation rate to sample well below the physical bandwidth of the signal. This work demonstrates a PCB-based hardware implementation of a 32-channel analog front-end (AFE) employing sub-Nyquist sampling. We additionally demonstrate a mixer-based subarray beamforming technique that exploits the narrowband nature of the receiver to beamform received signals prior to digitization. Together, these techniques reduce the aggregate data rate by a factor of 43x when compared to a conventional system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329107/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601606","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329107/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sub-nyquist analog front-end with subarray beamforming for ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-nyquist analog front-end with subarray beamforming for ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066416S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329109,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Medisvs, Philips Research France, France"],"lastName":"Bo Zhang","id":"37085749639"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Robert","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, USA"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Robert","id":"37707127900"},{"name":"Guillaume David","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"David","id":"37085746027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329109","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329109","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Geometry","Image reconstruction","Transducers","Phantoms","Probes","Speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical ultrasonics","cardiology","compressed sensing","geometry","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","optimisation","phantoms","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-domain compressed beamforming","medical ultrasound imaging","dual-domain compressed sensing technique","geometry information","depth-dependent optimization problems","wavelet domain","geometry","image domain","iterations","holey-tissue artifacts","single-domain reconstructions","CIRS phantom","cardiac scan","spherical-wave transmissions","image quality","plane-wave transmissions","depth 15 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-domain compressed sensing","Iterative beamforming","Alternating direction multiplier method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0305","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329109.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-domain compressed beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel beamforming approach based on a dual-domain compressed sensing (CS) technique. We model the image as a combination of geometry information and residual details. The beamforming is formulated as depth-dependent optimization problems, solved successively in wavelet domain to capture the overall geometry, and in the image domain to preserve details. With a budget of few iterations, our approach preserves better features and produces less holey-tissue artifacts compared to single-domain reconstructions. Tested on simulated data, CIRS phantom and a cardiac scan, our beamforming requires typically three plane/spherical-wave transmissions to achieve comparable or better image quality than delay-and-sum (DAS) using eleven transmissions. We thus attain a theoretical frame rate over 1KHz at depth of 15cm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329109/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601693","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329109/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dual-domain compressed beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-domain compressed beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072918S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329113,"authors":[{"name":"Deep Bera","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Thoraxcenter, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Deep","lastName":"Bera","id":"37949134800"},{"name":"Johan G.

Recent evidence implicates wavefront distortion from sound speed inhomogeneity and reverberation. To target the reverberation problem, we developed an algorithm called Aperture Domain Model Image REconstruction (ADMIRE). ADMIRE explicitly models, identifies and suppresses acoustic clutter resulting from multipath or off-axis scattering. Also because multipath scattering can be hard to study, we introduce a new method for obtaining pulse-echo measures of reverberation from ex vivo tissue samples. We demonstrate that ADMIRE improves contrast and CNR by 7.1\u00b12.5 dB and 0.86\u00b10.92 dB, respectively. We also apply ADMIRE to multipath scattering from a porcine abdominal wall layer and show that we can reduce the relative clutter level by 13 dB compared to standard beamforming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329129/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601597","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329129/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear beamforming of aperture domain signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear beamforming of aperture domain signals","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058922S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329143,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Bouzari","affiliation":["Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Bouzari","id":"37580464100"},{"name":"Mathias Engholm","affiliation":["Dept. of Micro-and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

However, the achievable spatial resolution and contrast of the B-mode images in Delay and Sum (DAS) beamforming are limited by the aperture size and by the operating frequency. This paper, investigates Spatial Matched Filter (SMF) beamforming on row-column addressed 2-D arrays to increase spatial resolution. The performance is investigated on both simulated and experimentally collected 3-D data by comparing the Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and the phantom images obtained with standard DAS and with SMF. Results show that the SMF beamformer outperforms DAS in both simulated and experimental trials and that a higher contrast resolution can be achieved by SMF beamforming (i.e., narrower main lobe and lower side lobes). The 6dB, 20dB and 40dB cystic resolution for a DAS simulated PSF at (0,0,30)mm are 1.22mm, 3.54mm and 7.46mm, for SMF beamforming they are 1.11mm, 2.33mm and 5.42mm accordingly. For measured RF-data of an iron needle facing toward the transducer positioned at (0,0,32.5)mm along the central axis, the 6dB, 20dB and 40dB cystic resolution for DAS beamforming are 1.99mm, 2.19mm and 4.26mm, and they are 0.8mm, 2.06mm and 4.18mm for SMF beamforming accordingly. SMF beamforming increases the contrast resolution which turns into a better quality of the B-mode images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329143/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15615419","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329143/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Volumetric ultrasound imaging with row-column addressed 2-D arrays using Spatial Matched Filter beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volumetric ultrasound imaging with row-column addressed 2-D arrays using Spatial Matched Filter beamforming","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055844S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329155,"authors":[{"name":"Libertario Demi","affiliation":["Lab. of Biomedical Diagnostics, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Libertario","lastName":"Demi"},{"name":"Gabriele Giannini","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Giannini"},{"name":"Alessandro Ramalli","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Ramalli"},{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Tortoli"},{"name":"Massimo Mischi","affiliation":["Lab. of Biomedical Diagnostics, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Mischi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329155","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Imaging","Standards","Signal to noise ratio","Harmonic analysis","Ultrasonic imaging","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","data acquisition","image denoising","image resolution","medical image processing","OFDM modulation","phantoms","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifocus tissue harmonic imaging","parallel transmit beamforming","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultrasound tissue harmonic imaging","OFDM-PBT","data acquisition rate","transducer bandwidth","data acquisition rate","penetration depth","signal-noise ratio","SNR","tissue mimicking phantom","standard B-mode imaging","improved penetration depth","axial resolution"]}],"abstract":"Parallel beamforming in transmit (PBT) by means of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) was recently applied to increase the frame rate of ultrasound tissue harmonic imaging.

In turn, this allows the system to be operated in isolation or in conjunction with commercial generic hardware platforms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329186.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a hybrid custom / commercial multi-channel, high-frequency transmit pulser and beamformer system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329186/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a hybrid custom / commercial multi-channel, high-frequency transmit pulser and beamformer system","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601465","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a hybrid custom / commercial multi-channel, high-frequency transmit pulser and beamformer system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044401S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329189,"authors":[{"name":"Elahe Moghimirad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Elahe","lastName":"Moghimirad","id":"38303256900"},{"name":"Carlos A.

The cystic resolution of point targets at different depths for -20 dB and -6 dB demonstrates a better resolution for FB at all depths.

However, high bandwidth requirements and extreme computational complexity have precluded hand-held and low-power 3D systems, limiting 3D applications. In previous work, we presented Sonic Millip3De, a hardware design that can efficiently handle the high computational demand of real-time 3D synthetic aperture beamforming, even in handheld and mobile applications. The design combines a custom, highly parallel hardware system with a novel delay approximation method to quickly produce high quality 3D image data within an estimated 15 W full-system power budget. Prior evaluations of the design relied on software prototypes; this work extends previous evaluations with an FPGA implementation of the beamforming accelerator, validating the results of earlier prototypes. In particular, we carry out image quality analyses of our beamforming architecture using simulated 3D echo data (from Field II) and 2D artificial tissue phantom data acquired using a Verasonics V-1 system and Philips P4-1 probe. We compare results from the FPGA implementation to an ideal software beamformer and prior software prototypes of the Sonic Millip3De design.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0514","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of low-power 3D ultrasound beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329210/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of low-power 3D ultrasound beamformer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601625","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329210/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of low-power 3D ultrasound beamformer","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065309S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329227,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Bai","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, P.

Conventionally, Fourier Transform (FFT) is utilized to determine the full channel spectrum and thus suffers from high computation load. In this work, autocorrelation (AR)-based algorithm is utilized to provide the spectral parameters of channel data for GCF estimation with reduced complexity. Autocorrelation takes advantage of the phase difference among neighboring channel pairs to estimate the mean frequency and bandwidth of channel spectrum. Based on these spectral parameters, GCF weighting can be approximated by assuming normalized distribution (e.g., Gaussian) of the channel spectrum. Since the spatial frequency in channel spectrum actually corresponds to the incident angle of echoes, the spectral power ratio within the defined range of mainlobe direction can be analytically computed from the simulated spectral shape as the value of GCF weighting. While the GCF computation complexity of a N-channel system reduces from O(NlogN) with FFT to O(N) with AR, results shows that the image contrast increases from 6.7 with GCF-FFT to 9.0 with GCF-AR. Corresponding B-mode images also indicate that the speckle background in GCF-AR image is more resistant to the black-region artifacts in the presence of strong reflectors. Overall, GCF-AR can improve the computation efficiency of adaptive imaging while providing superior image quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15615418","htmlLink":"/document/7329231/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity adaptive beamforming using autocorrelation-based generalized coherence factor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity adaptive beamforming using autocorrelation-based generalized coherence factor","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164771S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329276,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Xing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-Xing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37898207600"},{"name":"Chia-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kao-Yuan University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085349524"},{"name":"Yi-Chun Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chun","lastName":"Du","id":"37085367623"},{"name":"Pei-Jarn Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Jarn","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240718500"},{"name":"Cho-Chiang Shih","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cho-Chiang Shih","id":"37087657034"},{"name":"Tainsong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tainsong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37382882300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329276","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of arteriovenous fistula stenosis by FPGA based Doppler flow imaging system","abstract":"Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a vascular access and very import in hemodialysis that is a treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease. Stenosis is considered the major cause of dysfunction of AVF. Despite the relatively low thrombosis rates of AVF, surveillance programs are necessary for detection of stenosis. However, conventional Doppler ultrasound cannot facilitate the risk assessment of AVF, such as insufficient resolution. The objective of this study was to develop an estimation system using FPGA based color relational analysis (CRA) method for AVF stenosis on hemodialysis patients by quantitative Doppler ultrasound, which provides not only the degrees of stenosis (DOS), but also anatomical locations and blood flow physiology information for clinical physicians, lowing the risk arising from treatment. In this paper we proposed a method based on hemodynamic analysis with dimensionless numbers to capture and further quantify the feature values of Doppler ultrasound extracted from intraluminal blood flow. The ratio of the supracritical Reynolds (Resupra) number and the resistive (Res) index were calculated via the peak-systolic and peak-diastolic velocities of blood flow from the arterial anastomosis sites (A) to the venous anastomosis sites (V) to quantitate the DOS at multiple measurement sites. After that, the results were mapped with a CRA classifier to real-time display the DOS. The examination results from thirty long-term dialysis patients showed that this proposed method performed well in DOS and occlusion site detection, with >95% of accuracy. This study confirmed the CRA method is a potential candidate method to effectively evaluate the AVF caused by long-term dialysis or vascular disease.

Assuming Gaussian signals with known covariance matrix for signal and noise, a sufficient statistics is found as a quadratic form of the element signals, with weight-matrix given by the signal and noise covariance matrices. Several beamforming methods, including standard beamsum (BS), and short lag spatial coherence (SLSC) can be expressed in the same way as a quadratic form, with different weight-matrices. By eigenvalue decomposition of the weight-matrix, the beamformer output can be written as a square sum of standard beamsum terms, with the eigenfunctions as apodization windows. The receive beamprofile can be calculated as the square sum of the Fourier transform of the eigenfunctions. In this way the weight-matrix can be optimized both for detection and spatial resolution/side lobe level. A simulation experiment was performed: a circular-shaped uniform speckle region was set in band-pass filtered white noise, with SNR= 9 dB. The NP-test showed the best detection performance, but slightly higher sidelobe level than BS. SLSC showed poorer detection performance than the two other methods, as well as higher sidelobes.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0177","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0177","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum beamformer strategy for detecting signals in clutter noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimum beamformer strategy for detecting signals in clutter noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329281/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329281/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615459","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum beamformer strategy for detecting signals in clutter noise","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044215S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329316,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoon Hyun","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Dongwoon","lastName":"Hyun","id":"38469478700"},{"name":"Gregg E.

Contrast agents, while effective, increase cost and examination time. SLSC imaging is a coherence-based beamforming technique that has demonstrated clutter reducing capabilities in a variety of applications. Previously, real-time SLSC imaging of a large field of view was achieved at up to 6 fps, inadequate for visualizing a quickly moving target such as the heart. In our previous work, we developed efficient modifications to the SLSC algorithm to obtain fast and precise measurements of spatial coherence. In this work, these techniques were implemented on a GPU-based software beamformer to develop a real-time SLSC imaging system suitable for echocardiography. The system was then used in a clinical study to image 15 patients with poor image quality, as determined by trained sonographers. Real-time display of side-by-side B-mode and SLSC images were obtained at frame rates ranging from 21 to 31 fps. B-mode and SLSC video clips were given in shuffled order to a cardiologist, who rated the visibility s of each of 12 LV segments as 0=invisible, 1=poorly visualized, or 2=well visualized. Scores of 0 and 1 indicated a need for contrast agent. A two-tailed paired t-test showed that SLSC imaging demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the number of visualized segments (s > 0, p = 0.0032) and in the number of segments that were well visualized (s = 2, p = 0.0061).","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0077","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329316.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0077","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time high-framerate in vivo cardiac SLSC imaging with a GPU-based beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time high-framerate in vivo cardiac SLSC imaging with a GPU-based beamformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329316/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601752","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time high-framerate in vivo cardiac SLSC imaging with a GPU-based beamformer","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053795S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329332,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanie Dencks","affiliation":["Institute for Medical Engineering, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefanie","lastName":"Dencks","id":"37296965700"},{"name":"Georg Schmitz","affiliation":["Institute for Medical Engineering, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Schmitz","id":"37300227400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329332","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Needles","Ultrasonic variables measurement","RF signals","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Scattering","Transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","medical signal processing","needles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming","punctures","sonography","needle visibility","ultrasound wave incidence angle","transducer single elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["needle visibility","beamforming","resonance scattering","punctures","hollow cylinder"]}],"abstract":"In sonography the visibility of a needle becomes poor for deep puncture targets because the angle of incidence of the ultrasound wave increases. In [1] we showed with simulations and measurements that despite large puncture angles an unexpectedly good needle visibility in some image sectors can be generally explained by resonant scattering modes of the needle. As a first step to assess the potential of needle enhancement by a beamformer adapted to the needle specific signals, we investigate the RF signals scattered from the needle, which are received at the transducer's single elements. We show that these RF signals arrive earlier at the elements than assumed for the conventional beamforming. This effect leads to artefacts in the B-mode images. But, the more important fact is that considerable energy scattered from the needle is not used for its detection and imaging. With a rough estimate we show that a needle signal enhancement of up to 26 dB depending on the puncture angle could be possible.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0301","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

The pulse-shaping parameters are computed using an open-loop charge control algorithm that uses electrical impedance data for the identification of the nonlinear input-output characteristic of the CMUT. A 0-200V unipolar pulser, provided with a digital control logic for the trapezoidal pulse-shaping, was designed and fabricated using a BCD-SOI technology available at STMicroelectronics. The pulser was connected to a 10MHz CMUT linear array developed for medical imaging applications.

It significantly improves image quality and allows for much faster image acquisition. This method, however, incurs severe computational loads that create a major bottleneck in its implementation using existing commercial systems. To overcome this limitation we translate the beamforming, which is the basic processing step, to the frequency domain. As a result the computations can be carried out much more efficiently and using less data samples. To this end, we extend the frequency domain beamforming (FDBF) framework developed recently for the focused imaging mode to plane-wave imaging. We show that the core of FDBF, the relationship between the beam and the detected signals in the frequency domain, holds and can be implemented efficiently by introducing an appropriate approximation. We also show that dynamic aperture and apodization, crucial for image quality improvement, can be applied directly in frequency as a part of FDBF. The translation of beamforming into the frequency domain allows for data rate reduction by eliminating oversampling, required by digital implementation of beamforming in time. As a result the signals are sampled and processed at their effective Nyquist rate, leading to a 4-fold reduction in the number of samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329373/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15601562","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329373/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fourier domain beamforming for coherent plane-wave compounding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier domain beamforming for coherent plane-wave compounding","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089735S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329423,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik J.

The system was optimized for Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) using unfocused ultrasound transducers. Due to low SNR of the signals, Coded Excitation (CE) and Matched Filter (MF) are applied. For complex objects the received signals (A-scans) consist of multiple overlaid reflections. The overlaid reflections are difficult to separate due to the system's limited bandwidth which results in side lobes. Non-separable reflections limit the resolution and contrast of the resulting images. Using Huffman Sequences (HS) as CE, a trade-off can be set between the side lobe suppression and loss of main lobe energy. Higher suppression of side lobes results in reduced energy in the CE, i.e. smaller SNR. So an approach has been implemented which suppresses the side lobes, but preserves the energy of CE by designing a Huffman sequences based mismatched filter. Combination of a CE and different filters were evaluated for single reflection and multiple overlaid reflections. The results show high side lobe suppression within limited bandwidth and preserve the SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329426/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601796","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Huffman Sequences based mismatched filter for bandwidth limited 3D USCT system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Huffman Sequences based mismatched filter for bandwidth limited 3D USCT system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05949S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7329437,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki Hasegawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Research, University of Toyama, Toyama"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37274688100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kanai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Tohoku University","Graduate School of Engineering"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kanai","id":"37085355903"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329437","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Covariance matrices","Spatial resolution","Transducers","Imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","phantoms","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carotid artery","B-mode imaging","lateral spatial resolution","fine wire","echo","parallel beamforming","phantom","spatial covariance matrix","sub-aperture beamforming","amplitude and phase estimation beamformer","element directivity","adaptive beamformer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamformer incorporating with element directivity","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0016","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329437","abstract":"High frame rate ultrasound is an emerging technique for medical ultrasound imaging. However, spatial resolution and contrast are degraded compared to conventional beamforming using focused transmit beams. In the present study, a kind of minimum variance beamformer, namely, amplitude and phase estimation (APES) beamformer, was examined for improvement of the spatial resolution. The APES beamformer estimates the desired signal, i.e., echo from the focal point, using delay-and-sum beamforming without considering the element directivity and removes it from the spatial covariance matrix. By omitting the element directivity, the error in estimation of the desired signal increases and, as a result, more part of the desired signal remains in the spatial covariance matrix. Consequently, sub-array averaging is necessary for further suppressing the desired signal contained in the spatial covariance matrix. In the present study, the APES beamformer was modified so as to consider the element directivity in estimation of the desired signal. Also, the proposed APES beamforming was further modified to be applied to outputs of sub-aperture beamforming to reduce dimension of the spatial covariance matrix. In the present study, the effect of the element directivity on APES beamforming was evaluated by a basic experiment using a phantom. In parallel beamforming with the conventional DAS, lateral spatial resolution, which was evaluated from the lateral full width at half maximum of the amplitude profile of an echo from a fine wire, was 0.50 mm. Using conventional APES, the lateral spatial resolution was improved to 0.26 mm. Lateral spatial resolution was further improved to 0.25 mm using the modified APES. In both APES beamforming, sub-array averaging was not used, and outputs from 6 sub-apertures were processed. Also in B-mode imaging of a carotid artery, undesired echoes are suppressed significantly by the modified APES.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15615493","htmlLink":"/document/7329437/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamformer incorporating with element directivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamformer incorporating with element directivity","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069128S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329447,"authors":[{"name":"Congzhi Wang","affiliation":["Paul C.

However, it still needs to find a compromise between the frame rate and image quality, which restricts its wider implementation. How to maintain the high frame rate and improve the image quality at the same time, has become a significant issue on plane-wave imaging technique. Although several methods based on compressive sensing (CS) have been proposed in previous studies, they still have some limitations, especially on the memory occupation and the amount of computation. In this paper, a novel CS-based beamforming method used for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is proposed and its image quality has been verified on several simulated phantoms. In this method, only the relationship between the time-delay information and the spatial distribution of the scatterers is considered when establishing the encoding matrix. In addition, the encoding matrix is expressed totally in time-domain with a dictionary-searching concept, and can be sparse-expressed with very low memory occupation. The imaging results have been compared with the traditional DAS method and the coherent compounding method. The image quality of CS method has been verified to be better than the traditional DAS method and even the coherent compounding method. The proposed method can be easily implemented on some low-cost hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with both high frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great potential for clinical application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plane-wave ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing with low memory occupation","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0309","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329447.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Plane-wave ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing with low memory occupation","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329447/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601747","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane-wave ultrasound imaging based on compressive sensing with low memory occupation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051275S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329456,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Risser","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Risser"},{"name":"Hans Joachim Welsch","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Hans Joachim","lastName":"Welsch"},{"name":"Heinrich Fonfara","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Heinrich","lastName":"Fonfara"},{"name":"Wolfgang Bost","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Bost"},{"name":"Steffen Weber","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Weber"},{"name":"Holger Hewener","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Hewener"},{"name":"Steffen Tretbar","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Biomedizinische Technik, Sulzbach, Saarland, DE"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Tretbar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329456","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":613},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Ultrasonic imaging","Frequency measurement","Bandwidth","Field programmable gate arrays","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","C++ language","closed loop systems","data visualisation","graphics processing units","local area networks","medical image processing","parallel processing","software packages","ultrasonic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency ultrasound beamformer","nondestructive testing","ultrasound application","customizable excitation sequence","single element channel","gigabit Ethernet","PCI-express","massive parallel computing graphics processor","GPU","software package","closed loop control","Matlab","C++","C#","data visualisation","biomedical imaging method","element ultrasound array","signal quality","frequency 80 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high frequency ultrasound beamformer","non destructive testing","small animal imaging","plane wave beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329456","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0255","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"Several research platforms are available for the development of ultrasound applications and algorithm designs but they are all limited by its digitalization frequency ranging up to 80 MHz for standard medical imaging.

Based on the ultrasound research platform \u201cDiPhAS\u201d we realized the high frequency version of the beamformer with a digitalization rate of up to 480 MHz at all 128 channels. Each channel is built individually because no integrated circuits with multiple channels are commercially available for such a high digitalization rate.

Beamforming can be done on a massive parallel computing graphics processor (GPU). Online and offline software packages including closed loop control and filtering interfaces for Matlab, C++ and C# are used to process, analyze and visualize the data to characterize the beamformer.

The objective of the work is to investigate the implementation complexity and processing demands. The image processing is performed using the principle of Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming (SASB) and the flow estimator is implemented using the cross-correlation estimator. Results are evaluated using a HTC Nexus 9 tablet and a BK Medical BK3000 ultrasound scanner emulating a wireless probe. The duplex imaging setup consists of interleaved B-mode and CFM frames. The required data throughput for real-time imaging is 36.1 MB/s. The measured data throughput peaked at 39.562 MB/s, covering the requirement for real-time data transfer and overhead in the TCP/IP protocol. Benchmarking of real-time imaging showed a total processing time of 25.7 ms (39 frames/s) which is less than the acquisition time (29.4 ms). In conclusion, the proposed implementation demonstrates that both B-mode and CFM can be executed in-time for real-time ultrasound imaging and that the required bandwidth between the probe and processing unit is within the current Wi-Fi standards.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15601521","htmlLink":"/document/7329465/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of real-time duplex synthetic aperture ultrasonography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of real-time duplex synthetic aperture ultrasonography","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015000927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057141S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329474,"authors":[{"name":"Sewoong Ahn","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Sewoong","lastName":"Ahn"},{"name":"Jeeun Kang","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Jeeun","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Pilsu Kim","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Pilsu","lastName":"Kim"},{"name":"Gunho Lee","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Gunho","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Eunji Jeong","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Eunji","lastName":"Jeong"},{"name":"Woojin Jung","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Woojin","lastName":"Jung"},{"name":"Minsuk Park","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Minsuk","lastName":"Park"},{"name":"Tai-kyong Song","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Tai-kyong","lastName":"Song"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329474","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":959},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Universal Serial Bus","Biomedical imaging","Image coding","Safety","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","medical signal processing","portable instruments","prototypes","smart phones","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smartphone based portable ultrasound imaging system","prototype implementation","prototype evaluation","smart US imaging system","android-OS smartphone","point-of-care diagnostic applications","Galaxy S5 LTE-A","beamforming","midprocessing procedures","envelope detection","log compression","2D image filtering","digital scan conversion","image display","custom made graphical user interface","USB 3.0 protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smartphone","ultrasound imaging system","System implementation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a smart US imaging system (SMUS) based on an android-OS smartphone, which can provide maximally optimized efficacy in terms of weight and size in point-of-care diagnostic applications.

These estimators rely on the beamformed RF signal to accurately estimate time and phase shifts. Partially coherent targets such as speckle, however, introduce variance and bias errors into the estimation because the delay-and-sum beamformer does not adapt to the spatial variation of the sampled waveform. In addition, the presence of acoustic and thermal noise can exacerbate this problem. We introduce a method that modifies the information used by the beamformer when it is applied to velocity and displacement estimation. Using simulations, velocity was estimated between RF channel signals, rather than beamformed RF signals, using Kasai's and Loupas' autocorrelation methods. Velocity and displacement was estimated from those channel signal pairs that exhibited high correlation. By eliminating incoherent information in Kasai's and Loupas' velocity estimators, jitter was reduced in high noise environments. For example, at 0 dB noise relative to the blood in the channel signals, Limiting the signal to high coherence signals (e.g. 10 spatial lags) reduced the jitter in the Kasai velocity estimator from approximately 6.0 mm/s to 2.5 mm/s. In general, jitter increased with increasingly incoherent information added into the beamformed signal and low noise yielded smaller jitter.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0013","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329507.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0013","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherence beamforming applied to velocity estimation and partially coherent signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coherence beamforming applied to velocity estimation and partially coherent signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329507/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329507/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601668","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherence beamforming applied to velocity estimation and partially coherent signals","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015001019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047239S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329521,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Kai Weng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Kai","lastName":"Weng","id":"37085665789"},{"name":"Jeng-Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeng-Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085677325"},{"name":"Chih-Chung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chung","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293540100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329521","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Tongue","Sleep apnea","Biomedical imaging","Transducers","Field programmable gate arrays","Ultrasonic variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","biomechanics","biomedical electronics","biomedical ultrasonics","deformation","field programmable gate arrays","medical image processing","neurophysiology","sleep","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based wearable ultrasound device","monitoring obstructive sleep apnea syndrome","breathing disorder","pharyngeal airway","intermittent hypoxemia","arousal","OSA","clinical diagnosis","real-time monitoring","custom-designed ultrasonic array transducer","high-speed analog-to-digital converter","high speed digital I-O","ultrasound pulse repetition frequency","pulse center frequency","programmable FPGA board","anthropometric measurement","system performance","dynamic variation","tongue base deformation","ultrasound receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Obstructive sleep apnea","Tongue base","Mueller maneuver","Ultrasound system","Wearable device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329521","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329521.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-based wearable ultrasound device for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea syndrome","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a breathing disorder characterized by repetitive collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, can cause intermittent hypoxemia and frequent arousal. Many studies have demonstrated that the deformation of tongue base plays an important role in OSA. Currently, several medical imaging modalities have been used to record the airway changes, such as cine MRI and ultrafast CT. However, most of them are difficult to be used widely in clinical diagnosis for continuous recording the deformation of tongue in real-time, particularly during sleeping. In order to overcome these problems, a wearable ultrasonic device was developed for real-time monitor of the dynamic change of the tongue base in this study. The device includes a custom-designed 3.5-MHz ultrasonic array transducer, an ultrasound pulser/receiver, high-speed analog-to-digital converter, high speed digital I/O, and a FPGA board. The ultrasound pulse repetition frequency and pulse center frequency were controlled by the programmable FPGA board.

In a recent study [1] we have shown that compressed sensing-based reconstruction of Doppler signal allowed reducing the number of Doppler emissions and yielded better results than traditional interpolation. However, in this study the reduction of Doppler emission had to be limited to 60% in order to produce satisfying reconstruction (i.e. a PSNR > 20 dB). We propose here to improve over this study by using a block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework for randomly interleaving Doppler and US emissions. The interest of using such framework in the context of duplex Doppler is linked to the unique ability of BSBL to exploit block-correlated signals and to recover non-sparse signals. The performance of the technique is evaluated for simulated data and compared to the recent results in [1].

Previously, Harmonic Reduction Pulse Width Modulation (HRPWM) has been proposed to allow the design of low harmonic content switched mode excitation signals through a parameterized design process. This paper proposes the technique arbitrary-HRPWM (AHRPWM) to allow the synthesis of three and five level true arbitrary switched mode excitation waveforms. The technique is demonstrated through the design and evaluation of linear frequency modulated waveforms that have been pre-distorted to compensate for transducer characteristics. After simulating the transducers response the resulting switched mode waveforms show am 0.06% amplitude error in the time domain compared to the amplified analog waveform and -45 dB and -35 dB third harmonic powers for the three and five level switched mode waveforms respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0280","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329574.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary waveform generation based on phase and amplitude synthesis for switched mode excitation of ultrasound imaging arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary waveform generation based on phase and amplitude synthesis for switched mode excitation of ultrasound imaging arrays","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615449","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary waveform generation based on phase and amplitude synthesis for switched mode excitation of ultrasound imaging arrays","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015001210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063225S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7329577,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Mamou","affiliation":["Frederic L.

Therefore, in previous studies, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) methods were developed to detect metastatic regions in freshly excised sentinel lymph nodes from breast-cancer patients using a 26-MHz transducer. A Gaussian form factor was used to obtain QUS estimates for cancer detection. In this study, quantitative acoustic microscopy (QAM) at 250 MHz was performed to obtain 2D maps of speed of sound (c), attenuation (A) and acoustic impedance (Z) of nodal tissue microstructure with a spatial resolution of 7 \u00b5m. These maps were used to develop new ultrasound-scattering models to improve understanding of ultrasound scattering in lymph nodes. In total, 17 12-\u00b5m thick sections from 12 lymph nodes were scanned using a custom-built QAM system based on an F-1.16, 250-MHz transducer (160-MHz bandwidth). Radio-frequency (RF) signals were digitized at 2.5 GHz with 12-bit accuracy, and 2D QAM maps of Z, A, and c were generated using custom-developed, signal-processing algorithms. Scanned samples were stained using hematoxylin and eosin and imaged by light microscopy. 2D Z maps (2DZMs) were then processed to yield a novel lymph-node-specific scattering model (i.e., form factor), which then was compared to the currently used Gaussian model. The new model was obtained by optimizing an exponential model fit to the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the 2DZMs that assumed isotropic scattering. The study illustrates that fine-resolution maps of acoustic properties of lymph nodes can improve the model of ultrasound scattering at 26 MHz. The new lymph-node-specific, ultrasound-scattering model is expected to improve current QUS approaches for detecting metastatic regions in freshly excised sentinel lymph nodes from breast-cancer patients.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0173","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329577.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound-scattering models based on quantitative acoustic microscopy of fresh samples and unstained fixed sections from cancerous human lymph nodes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329577/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601723","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329577/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound-scattering models based on quantitative acoustic microscopy of fresh samples and unstained fixed sections from cancerous human lymph nodes","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015001219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045438S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7329603,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandra Ortega","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37085491247"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Pedrosa","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Pedrosa","id":"37085399016"},{"name":"Brecht Heyde","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Brecht","lastName":"Heyde","id":"38364912200"},{"name":"Ling Tong","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tong","id":"37071662500"},{"name":"Jan D'hooge","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"D'hooge","id":"37277201000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329603","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic method for determining the anatomical relevant space for fast volumetric cardiac imaging","abstract":"Fast volumetric cardiac imaging requires to reduce the number of transmit events within a single volume. One way of achieving this is by limiting the field-of-view (FOV) of the recording to the anatomically relevant domain only (e.g. the myocardium when investigating cardiac mechanics). Although fully automatic solutions towards myocardial segmentation exist, translating that information in a fast ultrasound scan sequence is not trivial. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a methodology to automatically define the FOV from a volumetric dataset in the context of anatomical scanning. Hereto, a method is proposed where the anatomical relevant space is automatically identified as follows. First, the left ventricular myocardium is localized in the volumetric ultrasound recording using a fully automatic real-time segmentation framework (i.e. BEAS). Then, the extracted meshes are employed to define a binary mask identifying myocardial voxels only. Later, using these binary images, the percentage of pixels along a given image line that belong to the myocardium is calculated. Finally, a spatially continuous FOV that covers `T' percentage of the myocardium is found by means of a ring-shaped template matching, giving as a result the opening angle and `thickness' for a conical scan. This approach was tested on 27 volumetric ultrasound datasets, a T = 85% was used. The mean initial opening angle for a conical scan was of 19.67\u00b18.53\u00b0 while the mean `thickness' of the cone was 19.01\u00b13.35\u00b0. Therefore, a reduction of 48.99% in the number of transmit events was achieved, resulting in a frame rate gain factor of 1.96. As a conclusion, anatomical scanning in combination with new scanning sequences techniques can increase frame rate significantly while keeping information of the relevant structures for functional imaging.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329603.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0124","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0124","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Myocardium","Imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Image segmentation","Array signal processing","Acoustic beams","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","cardiology","image segmentation","image sequences","medical image processing","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anatomical relevant space","fast volumetric cardiac imaging","field-of-view","anatomically relevant domain","myocardial segmentation","fast ultrasound scan sequence","anatomical scanning","left ventricular myocardium","volumetric ultrasound recording","automatic real-time segmentation framework","binary mask identifying myocardial voxels","spatially continuous FOV","ring-shaped template matching","conical scan","volumetric ultrasound datasets","mean initial opening angle","frame rate gain factor","scanning sequence techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast cardiac imaging","Beamforming","Anatomical scan"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329603/","displayDocTitle":"An automatic method for determining the anatomical relevant space for fast volumetric cardiac imaging","accessionNumber":"15601740","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329603/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic method for determining the anatomical relevant space for fast volumetric cardiac imaging","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015001294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042592S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329604,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Yu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Yu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085634969"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Li","id":"37278837300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8182-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8181-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329604","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducer arrays","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear array beamformation","virtual subwavelength receiving elements","side-lobes","window method","Tukey window","Hamming window","grating lobes","linear arrays","sub-wavelength pitch","delay-and-sum beamformation","delay estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear array beamformation","plane wave imaging","grating-lobe suppression","sidelobe suppression","virtual sub-wavelength receiving element"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear array beamformation using virtual sub-wavelength receiving elements","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329057","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7315052/7329057/07329604.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0078","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329604","abstract":"Generally, the grating-lobe artifacts can be avoided with array pitch smaller than one half of wavelength; however, due to cost or physical limitations, such a condition is hard to be satisfied in multi-dimension or high frequency array transducers. Besides grating lobes, side-lobe signals also affect imaging contrast and quality. To suppress the side-lobes, the window method such as Tukey window and Hamming window is widely used. To suppress grating lobes and side-lobes associated with linear arrays, we propose a novel linear array beamformation method based on a concept of virtual sub-wavelength receiving elements. Each array element is virtually divided into multiple sub-elements with sub-wavelength pitch. The signal detected by each virtual sub-element contributes to that of its physical element at different arrival time. Therefore, the signals of the virtual sub-elements from the same physical elements are approximated using the same signal received by their physical element. Delay-and-sum beamformation on receive is then done with the approximated signals and corresponding delays of the virtual sub-elements instead of using those of physical elements. Such a beamformation synthesizes a non-uniform sampled receive aperture with its mean effective array pitch smaller than one wavelength; thus the grating lobes can be suppressed. The sub-wavelength mean effective array pitch implies that better receiving delay estimation, because of smaller effective receive elements, can be achieved, which plays the role of side-lobe suppression. Wire phantom experiments using a research ultrasound engine were performed to verify our idea. Our method provided at least 5-dB suppression of the grating lobe and sidelobes, and rivaled the window method. Our method works for coherent plane wave compounding as well. Optimal sub-wavelength dividing of each physical element will also be presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15615379","htmlLink":"/document/7329604/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Linear array beamformation using virtual sub-wavelength receiving elements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear array beamformation using virtual sub-wavelength receiving elements","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IUS2015001295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061505S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7315052","isNumber":"7329057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7315052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7329057","articleId":"7329604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329607,"authors":[{"name":"Coskun Tekes","affiliation":["George W.

Single chip capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays fabricated on front-end CMOS electronics with simplified electrical interconnect have been previously developed for highly flexible and compact catheters. In this study, we present a custom built real time imaging system utilizing catheters with single chip CMUT-on-CMOS arrays and show initial imaging results. The fabricated array has a dual-ring structure with 64 transmit (Tx) and 56 receive (Rx) elements. The CMUT arrays fit on a 2.1 mm diameter circular region with all the required front-end electronics. The device operates at 12 MHz center frequency and has around 20 V collapse voltage. The single-chip system requires 13 external connections including 4 Rx channels and power lines. The electrical connections to micro cables in the catheter are made from the top side of the chip using polyimide flex tapes. The device is placed on a 6-Fr catheter shaft and secured with a medical grade silicon rubber. For real time data acquisition, we developed a custom design FPGA based imaging platform to generate digital control sequences for the chip and collect RF data from Rx outputs. We performed imaging experiments using wire phantoms immersed in water to test the real time imaging system. The system has the potential to generate images at 32 fps rate with the particular catheter.

The advent of a full power electronics power system has raised new questions from the point of view of system dynamics, particularly when dealing with the new medium-voltage direct current distribution. The overall goal of guaranteeing a secure operation of the power system has brought researchers to consider two main approaches: reducing the dynamics of the large load to operate in a range of dynamics compatible with traditional generation systems, or making the generator set smarter through its power electronics interface. This paper compares these approaches to stable operation, focusing on the latter considered more in line with the progress of technology and in general more appealing.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2496789","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7329673/07329677.pdf","startPage":"2355","endPage":"2380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2496789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Flow Control and Network Stability in an All-Electric Ship","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329677","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329677/","displayDocTitle":"Power Flow Control and Network Stability in an All-Electric Ship","volume":"103","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602376","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329677/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Power Flow Control and Network Stability in an All-Electric Ship","sourcePdf":"jproc-cupelli-2496789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160283S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7329673","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7329673","articleId":"7329677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7329694,"authors":[{"name":"Adrienn Dinevay","affiliation":["Obudai Egyetem, Budapest, HU"],"firstName":"Adrienn","lastName":"Dinevay","id":"37087913360"},{"name":"J\u00f3zsef K.

Results of numerical simulations illustrate and substantiate the usability of the suggested approach.","doi":"10.1109/INES.2015.7329694","pdfPath":"/iel7/7318282/7329642/07329694.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INES.2015.7329694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization of a sigmoid generated Fixed Point Transformation from SISO to MIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generalization of a sigmoid generated Fixed Point Transformation from SISO to MIMO systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15604408","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329694/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization of a sigmoid generated Fixed Point Transformation from SISO to MIMO systems","confLoc":"Bratislava, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"20ines2015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053292S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7318282","isNumber":"7329642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7318282","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7329642","articleId":"7329694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7329708,"authors":[{"name":"Jana Lov\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1","affiliation":["Department of modeling and control of discrete processes, Institute of Informatics SAS, Bratislava, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Jana","lastName":"Lov\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1","id":"37085689028"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7939-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7938-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7329708","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Remuneration","Surface acoustic waves","Job shop scheduling","Yttrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computability","computational complexity","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satisfiability problem","logical formula","NP-complete problems","genetic algorithms","stepwise adaptation of weights","3-SAT problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NP-complete problem","3-SAT problem","backtracking","local searching","genetic algorithm (GA)","stepwise adaptation of weights (SAW)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329708","abstract":"The goal of the article is to compare efficiency of solving a problem of determining satisfiability of logical formulas SAT (3-SAT), which belongs to a class of NP-complete problems, either by using simple genetic algorithms or using genetic algorithms with suggested modified mechanism of stepwise adaptation of weights (SAW).

For many applications, it is important that the location or sensor that originates the collected information is ascertained. This article presents the detection of a mobile sensor's location in an indoor environment with the help of known location sensors (anchors) placed in the environment. Anchor sensors measure temperature, which is sent to a mobile phone via Bluetooth. The mobile phone can measure RSSI values of incoming signals as well as the temperature information coming from each of the anchor sensors. The Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model presented in this article was developed to detect the mobile phone location. The ANN model accepts the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measured by the mobile phone and the anchor sensor ID number as inputs. The ANN was first trained and tested, after which the error between mobile phone locations obtained in test results and actual locations was calculated. The results were compared through the Centroid Localization (CL) method, as is known in the literature. According to the results thus obtained, it was shown that more accurate location detection was possible with the ANN model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329709/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15604424","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329709/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Indoor localization with Bluetooth technology using Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor localization with Bluetooth technology using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bratislava, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"34ines2015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054381S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7318282","isNumber":"7329642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7318282","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7329642","articleId":"7329709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329710,"authors":[{"name":"Manash Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, India"],"firstName":"Manash","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37085658511"},{"name":"Soumya Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, India"],"firstName":"Soumya","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37960481400"},{"name":"Valentina E.

In this paper, a secured and trusted cloud system is proposed. Security could be embedded in middleware architecture of the cloud system. Threats related to the cloud security are dynamic in nature and recurrently changing the types of attacks encountered over time. Therefore, a computationally intelligent and adaptive decision mechanism based on fuzzy rules is introduced to take a proper decision according to the contextual variables.

Energy efficient routing strategies designed for static WSNs, such as routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), generally have a slow response to topology changes. Moreover, their high signalling cost to keep up-to-date routes in the presence of mobile nodes makes them inefficient in these scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Kalman positioning RPL (KP-RPL), a novel routing strategy for WSNs with both static and mobile nodes, based on RPL. The objective of KP-RPL is to provide robust and reliable routing, considering the positioning inaccuracies and node disconnections that arise in real-life WSNs. This considers the original RPL for the communication among static nodes and position-based routing for mobile nodes, which use a novel RPL metric that combines Kalman positioning and blacklisting. The simulation results show that the reliability and the robustness of the network in harsh conditions are enhanced compared with geographical routing. Moreover, KP-RPL reduces the density and the number of simultaneously active anchor nodes for positioning. As a result, the infrastructure cost is lower, and the network lifetime is extended.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2500916","startPage":"2151","endPage":"2161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7404293/07329917.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2500916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addressing Mobility in RPL With Position Assisted Metrics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Mobile nodes","Wireless sensor networks","Kalman filters","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","position control","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position assisted metrics","routing protocol","low-power networks","lossy networks","wireless sensor networks","energy efficient routing strategies","Kalman positioning RPL","static nodes","mobile nodes","Kalman blacklisting","reliability","robustness","harsh conditions","active anchor nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Network","Routing","RPL","Mobility","Kalman Filtering"]},{"kwd":["Wireless sensor network","routing","RPL","mobility","Kalman filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Addressing Mobility in RPL With Position Assisted Metrics","volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7329917/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15785817","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003176","fundingName":"Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte through the Spanish Government","grantNumber":"TEC2014-53656-R and AP2010-1911"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing Mobility in RPL With Position Assisted Metrics","sourcePdf":"jsen-barcelo-2500916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073154S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7404293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7404293","articleId":"7329917","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329919,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhua Li","affiliation":["Department of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yunhua","lastName":"Li","id":"37085760733"},{"name":"Bin Tian","affiliation":["Department of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Tian","id":"37299872000"},{"name":"Kechu Yi","affiliation":["Department of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Kechu","lastName":"Yi","id":"37275564300"},{"name":"Quan Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Chinese Electronic Equipment System Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085369895"},{"name":"Dechun Sun","affiliation":["Department of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Dechun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37832825900"},{"name":"Zujun Liu","affiliation":["Department of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zujun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37691266800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7329919","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust NDA Carrier Tracking Method for LDPC-Coded Systems With Symbol Rate Sampling","abstract":"In this letter, a robust nondata-aided (NDA) carrier tracking method is proposed for low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded systems with symbol rate sampling.

Green Cognitive Radio Networks: Architecture and Performance Analysis","abstract":"In this letter, we consider an RF-powered green cognitive radio network (RF-GCRN), where a central node, called a power beacon (PB), harvests green energy from ambient sources and wirelessly delivers random harvested energy to cognitive users. Random in-band energy transmission by PB is the only energy source of cognitive users. Performance of this network, with a single pair of secondary users, is analyzed under two spectrum access schemes, i.e., random access and spectrum sensing-based access schemes. Results show feasibility of the RF-GCRN model, if the energy transmission rate is below a certain threshold. This threshold is determined according to maximum tolerable delay of primary user and parameters of spectrum access scheme. Finding a closed form expression for this threshold results in a quite complicated formula, which cannot be helpful in determining feasibility region, due to excessive complexity. Instead, we numerically calculated feasibility regions of both access schemes to facilitate parameter selection process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","volume":"20","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"15773517","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329926/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF-Powered Green Cognitive Radio Networks: Architecture and Performance Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-Powered Green Cognitive Radio Networks: Architecture and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"lcomm-khoshabinobar-2500897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039022S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7399440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7399440","articleId":"7329926","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329932,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Haiden","affiliation":["Institute of Sensor and Actuator Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Christoph Haiden received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology (TUW), Austria, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics in 2010.

The microfluidic chip was fabricated by etching of shallow chambers in silicon and bonding with glass, thus achieving robust devices with low background signal for dark-field microscopy. The system is suitable for measuring particles in liquid media, such as metallic wear particles originating from lubricated tribocontacts in oil. Here, sample wear particles were generated in the laboratory by sliding a piston ring section against a cylinder liner section with a reciprocating tribometer using base oil (PAO8) as lubricant. Individual microparticles and nanoparticles are visualized by means of their scattered light, and sizes are determined by tracking of the diffusive Brownian motion in liquid. By heating the oil sample, the viscosity is reduced, which increases the extent of Brownian motion and facilitates tracking-based size calculations. The height of the microfluidic chamber was matched with the focal depth of the optical system, so that particles stay in focus during the whole measurement time. The resulting particle size distributions were monomodal and displayed a peak diameter of 230 nm, as confirmed by reference measurements with dynamic light scattering. Our approach represents a straightforward way to determine the size of microparticles and nanoparticles and has the potential for a continuous online operation. Compared with the state-of-the-art particle counters used in condition monitoring of industrial machinery, it is possible to detect much smaller particles and, therefore, allow early detection of wear before severe failure events take place.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7401148/07329932.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2501355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2501355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Microfluidic Chip and Dark-Field Imaging System for Size Measurement of Metal Wear Particles in Oil","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Optical sensors","Silicon","Liquids","Microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bonding processes","Brownian motion","light scattering","microfluidics","nanoparticles","oils","optical microscopy","particle detectors","particle size measurement","suspensions","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle size distribution","dynamic light scattering","particle counter","condition monitoring","industrial machinery","wear detection","optical system","tracking-based size calculation","diffusive Brownian motion","nanoparticle","microparticle","PAO8","base oil","reciprocating tribometer","cylinder liner section","piston ring section","lubricated tribocontact","metallic wear particle","liquid media","particle measurement","bonding","shallow chamber","etching","suspended particle detection","microfluidic sample cell","dark-field video microscopy setup","metal wear oil particle","size measurement","dark-field imaging system","microfluidic chip chamber","size 230 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brownian motion","dark field microscopy","microfluidic chip","micro-/nanoparticle tracking","wear particles in oil"]},{"kwd":["Brownian motion","dark field microscopy","microfluidic chip","micro-/nanoparticle tracking","wear particles in oil"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Microfluidic Chip and Dark-Field Imaging System for Size Measurement of Metal Wear Particles in Oil","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7329932/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785773","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian COMET Program (Project K2 XTribology) and carried out at the Excellence Centre of Tribology, Wiener Neustadt, Austria, and the Institute of Sensor and Actuator Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","grantNumber":"849109 and 824187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Microfluidic Chip and Dark-Field Imaging System for Size Measurement of Metal Wear Particles in Oil","sourcePdf":"jsen-haiden-2501355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118025S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7401148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7401148","articleId":"7329932","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7329939,"authors":[{"name":"Daya Shanker Khudia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["\nDaya Shanker Khudia is a Software Engineer at Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA.

More precisely, for the downlink transmissions, we make use of spatial modulation (SM), and for the uplink, we make use of the coordinate-interleaved orthogonal design (CIOD)-based space-time block code (STBC).

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology should be able to expand the single-input single-output channel capacity. 2x2 MIMO is adopted in ATSC3.0 as an optional method. In order to construct a next-generation terrestrial network using MIMO technology and to ensure an adequate link budget especially as regards the MIMO propagation parameters, two experimental stations have been installed in Hitoyoshi city, Kumamoto, Japan. This system is an extension of the conventional DTV system in Japan, called ISDB-T. NHK conducted 2x2 MIMO field tests using one station and 4x2 MIMO field tests using two stations composing a single frequency network (SFN). For the 4x2 MIMO test, an advanced SFN using space time coding was developed. The 2x2 MIMO field tests involved terrestrial 8K transmissions (91 Mb/s) over a single UHF band channel (6 MHz bandwidth). The degradation of required carrier to noise ratio compared to laboratory measurements in dual-polarized MIMO propagation was under 3 dB even in non-line-of-sight conditions. The 4x2 MIMO field tests indicated that the required received power of the SFN was up to 3 dB better than that of the conventional SFN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast

The proposed transmitter architecture, which is adopted as a baseline technology of the Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0, shares time and frequency interleavers, FFT, pilot patterns, guard interval, preamble, and bootstrap among different layers, so that the implementation of LDM receivers can be realized with less than 10% complexity increase compared to conventional single layer receivers. With such low complexity increment, we show simulation and laboratory test results that the proposed LDM system has significant performance advantage (3-9 dB) over traditional TDM systems, and maintains its performance up to the velocity of 260 km/h in mobile reception.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2492459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7426430/07329951.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7426430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2492459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Layered Division Multiplexing for ATSC 3.0","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Layered Division Multiplexing for ATSC 3.0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329951/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15823495","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329951/","volume":"62","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of the MSIP/IITP (Development of Service and Transmission Technology for Convergent Realistic Broadcast)","grantNumber":"R0101-15-294"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Layered Division Multiplexing for ATSC 3.0","sourcePdf":"tbc-kim-2492459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107448S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7426430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7426430","articleId":"7329951","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7329952,"authors":[{"name":"Bahar Azari","affiliation":["DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Bahar","lastName":"Azari","orcid":"0000-0002-6695-0610","id":"37085436228"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["ECE Dept., NJIT, CWCSPR, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37085469963"},{"name":"Umberto Spagnolini","affiliation":["DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Spagnolini","id":"37085591469"},{"name":"Antonia M.

In this letter, a framework based on a hypergraph formalism is proposed that enables the derivation of a performance characterization of clustered cooperative beamforming in terms of per-user degrees of freedom (DoF) via the efficient solution of a coloring problem. An emerging scenario in which clusters of co-operative base stations (BSs) arise is given by cellular networks with edge caching. In fact, clusters of BSs that share the same requested files can jointly beamform the corresponding encoded signals. Based on this observation, the proposed framework is applied to obtain quantitative insights into the optimal use of cache and backhaul resources in cellular systems with edge caching. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the merits of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2500895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7412801/07329952.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2500895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Analysis of Clustered Co-Operative Beamforming With Application to Edge Caching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Analysis of Clustered Co-Operative Beamforming With Application to Edge Caching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329952/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15802488","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329952/","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1525629"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypergraph-Based Analysis of Clustered Co-Operative Beamforming With Application to Edge Caching","sourcePdf":"lwc-azari-2500895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071383S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7412801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7412801","articleId":"7329952","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7329955,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Demirci","affiliation":["Aselsan, Mehmet Akif Ersoy Mahallesi 296, 16, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Demirci","id":"37085671298"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, C/ Pirineos, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","id":"37393409900"},{"name":"Juan Antonio Maestro","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, C/ Pirineos, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Antonio","lastName":"Maestro","id":"37410622900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"7329955","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"40KB","file":"/ielx7/12/7534965/7329955/graphical_abstract/tc-gagraphic-2498547.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/12/7534965/7329955/graphical_abstract/tc-gagraphic-2498547.jpg"},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Error Protection Codes Derived from Double Error Correction Orthogonal Latin Square Codes","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multi-bit error correction codes (ECCs) to protect SRAM memories. This has been caused by the increased number of multiple errors that memories suffer as technology scales. To be suitable to protect an SRAM memory, an ECC has to be decodable in parallel and with low latency. Among the codes proposed for memory protection are orthogonal latin square (OLS) codes that provide low latency decoding and a modular construction. For some applications, like multimedia or signal processing, the effect of errors on the memory bits can be very different depending on their position on the word. Therefore, in these cases, it is more effective to provide different degrees of error correction for the different bits. This is done with unequal error protection (UEP) codes. In this paper, UEP codes are derived from double error correction (DEC) OLS codes. The derived codes are implemented for an FPGA platform to evaluate the decoder complexity and latency. The results show that the new codes can be implemented with lower decoding delay than traditional SEC-DED codes and with a cost similar to that of both DEC OLS and SEC-DED codes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Decoding","Parity check codes","Random access memory","Error correction","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","orthogonal codes","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection codes","double-error correction orthogonal Latin square-codes","multibit error correction codes","ECC","SRAM memories","memory protection","low-latency decoding","modular construction","multimedia","signal processing","memory bits","degrees-of-error correction","UEP codes","DEC OLS codes","FPGA platform","decoder complexity","decoder latency","decoding delay","SEC-DED codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unequal error protection","Orthogonal Latin Squares codes","majority logic decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329955","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2498547","startPage":"2932","endPage":"2938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7534965/07329955.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2498547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329955/","displayDocTitle":"Unequal Error Protection Codes Derived from Double Error Correction Orthogonal Latin Square Codes","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","volume":"65","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16207472","htmlLink":"/document/7329955/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal Error Protection Codes Derived from Double Error Correction Orthogonal Latin Square Codes","sourcePdf":"tc-reviriego-2498547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086611S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7534965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7534965","articleId":"7329955","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7329961,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7369997/7329961/zpeng-2500908-small.gif","p":["Zhen Peng (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetics and microwave engineering from Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China, in 2008.","From 2008 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the ElectroScience Laboratory, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.

In this work, we present an algorithm that removes blur due to camera shake by combining information in the Fourier domain from nearby frames in a video. The dynamic nature of typical videos with the presence of multiple moving objects and occlusions makes this problem of camera shake removal extremely challenging, in particular when low complexity is needed. Given an input video frame, we first create a consistent registered version of temporally adjacent frames. Then, the set of consistently registered frames is blockwise fused in the Fourier domain with weights depending on the Fourier spectrum magnitude. The method is motivated from the physiological fact that camera shake blur has a random nature; therefore, nearby video frames are generally blurred differently. Experiments with numerous videos recorded in the wild, along with extensive comparisons, show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results while at the same time being much faster than its competitors.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2015.2501245","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/7349277/07329968.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"283","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2015.2501245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hand-Held Video Deblurring Via Efficient Fourier Aggregation","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6745852/7349277/7329968-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hand-Held Video Deblurring Via Efficient Fourier Aggregation","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15676921","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329968/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR"},{"fundingName":"ARO"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000266","fundingName":"NGA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Hand-Held Video Deblurring Via Efficient Fourier Aggregation","sourcePdf":"tci-delbracio-2501245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088487S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"7349277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7349277","articleId":"7329968","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7329974,"authors":[{"name":"Junlong Zhou","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7514295/7329974/zhou-2501286-small.gif","p":["Junlong Zhou (S\u201915) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.","He was a Research Visitor with the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.

Thus, energy efficient task scheduling with thermal consideration has become a pressing research issue in computing systems, especially for real-time embedded systems with limited cooling techniques. In this paper, we design a two-stage energy-efficient temperature-aware task scheduling scheme for heterogeneous real-time multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) systems. In the first stage, we analyze the energy optimality of assigning real-time tasks to multiple processors of an MPSoC system, and design a task assignment heuristic that minimizes the system dynamic energy consumption under the constraint of task deadlines. In the second stage, the optimality of minimizing the peak temperature of a processor is investigated, and a slack distribution heuristic is proposed to improve the temperature profile of each processor under the thermal constraint, thus the temperature-dependent system leakage energy consumption is reduced. Through the extensive efforts made in two stages, the system overall energy consumption is minimized. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2501286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7514295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2501286","endPage":"1282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7514295/07329974.pdf","startPage":"1269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Aware Task Scheduling for Energy Minimization in Heterogeneous Real-Time MPSoC Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329974/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Aware Task Scheduling for Energy Minimization in Heterogeneous Real-Time MPSoC Systems","volume":"35","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"16141405","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7329974/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91418203 and 61202103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004106","fundingName":"East China Normal University Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Cultivation Plan of Action","grantNumber":"PY2015047"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-Aware Task Scheduling for Energy Minimization in Heterogeneous Real-Time MPSoC Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-wei-2501286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097842S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7514295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7514295","articleId":"7329974","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7329976,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Magerl","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7514295/7329976/mager-2501312-small.gif","p":["Marko Magerl (S\u201914) received the mag. ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","He is an Associate Assistant with the Department of Electronics, Microelectronics, Computer and Intelligent Systems, University of Zagreb.

As another type of simplified decoders, symbol-reliability-based decoders further reduce the computational complexity. However, the previously proposed algorithms suffer severe error performance degradation for NB-LDPC codes with low column weights. In this paper, a weighted bit-reliability based (wBRB) decoder for NB-LDPC codes is developed and implemented with efficient layered partial-parallel structure. It not only balances the tradeoff between complexity and error performance, but also reduces the memory usage significantly. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the wBRB decoder, a full bit-reliability-based (FBRB) decoder is proposed. The FBRB decoder is derived based on the binary matrix representation of the nonzero entries in the parity-check matrix. Since more bit-reliability values are passed through the edges of the Tanner graph, the FBRB decoder can achieve better error performance and faster convergence rate than the wBRB decoder. Both of the decoders are implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 XC5VLX155T FPGA device for a (403,226) code over GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n).

This paper attempts to capture these newly developed features using the valuation of European options as a vehicle. Statistical analysis performed on the data collected from the currency option market clearly shows the coexistence of mean reversion, jumps, volatility smile, and leptokurtosis and fat tail. We characterize the dynamics of the underlying asset in this kind of environment by establishing a coupled stochastic differential equation model with triple characteristics of mean reversion, nonaffine stochastic volatility, and mixed-exponential jumps. Moreover, we propose a characteristic function method to derive the closed-form pricing formula. We also present a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm-based numerical solution method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate both the modeling methodology and the numerical algorithm. Results demonstrate that the model behaves well in capturing the properties observed in the market, and the FFT numerical algorithm is both accurate and efficient in addressing large amount of data.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2500885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7484223/07329987.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2500885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"European Option Pricing With a Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm for Big Data Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329987/","displayDocTitle":"European Option Pricing With a Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm for Big Data Analysis","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16070400","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329987/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71472069, 71372019 and 71102174"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP1173"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11JGC106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"European Option Pricing With a Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm for Big Data Analysis","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2500885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082725S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7484223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7484223","articleId":"7329987","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7329990,"authors":[{"name":"Qikun Shen","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7329990/shen-2496963-small.gif","p":["Qikun Shen received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and applications from the Chinese University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 1996, the M.Sc. degree in computer science and applications from Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D degree in control theorem and control applications from the College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2015.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University.

It is assumed that only the outputs of each follower and its neighbors are available in the design of its distributed controllers. Equivalent output injection sliding mode observers are proposed for each follower to estimate the states of itself and its neighbors, and an observer-based distributed adaptive controller is designed for each follower to guarantee that it asymptotically synchronizes to a leader with tracking errors being semi-globally uniform ultimate bounded, in which fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate unknown functions. Based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov function approach, using Filippov-framework, the closed-loop system stability analysis is conducted. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the developed design techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2496963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7744634/07329990.pdf","startPage":"3086","endPage":"3097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7744634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2496963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Via Sliding Mode Observers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Via Sliding Mode Observers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329990/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16465601","pubMedId":"26595935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7329990/","volume":"46","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473250, 61573112, 61473249, 61503156 and 61573307"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140102180 and LP140100471"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B12018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution","grantNumber":"14KJB120013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Via Sliding Mode Observers","sourcePdf":"tcyb-shen-2496963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159461S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7329990","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7329991,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Du","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7779168/7329991/du-2496974-small.gif","p":["Bo Du (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in photogrammetry and remote sensing from the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer, Wuhan University.

Even with very limited prior information? Active learning, which can be regarded as an iterative optimization procedure, plays a key role to construct a refined training set to improve the classification performance in a variety of applications, such as text analysis, image recognition, social network modeling, etc. Although combining representativeness and informativeness of samples has been proven promising for active sampling, state-of-the-art methods perform well under certain data structures. Then can we find a way to fuse the two active sampling criteria without any assumption on data? This paper proposes a general active learning framework that effectively fuses the two criteria. Inspired by a two-sample discrepancy problem, triple measures are elaborately designed to guarantee that the query samples not only possess the representativeness of the unlabeled data but also reveal the diversity of the labeled data. Any appropriate similarity measure can be employed to construct the triple measures. Meanwhile, an uncertain measure is leveraged to generate the informativeness criterion, which can be carried out in different ways. Rooted in this framework, a practical active learning algorithm is proposed, which exploits a radial basis function together with the estimated probabilities to construct the triple measures and a modified best-versus-second-best strategy to construct the uncertain measure, respectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art active learning algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7329991/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16577501","pubMedId":"26595936","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Representativeness and Informativeness for Active Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB719905"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471274, 41431175 and 61401317"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2014CFB193"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2042014kf0239"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Projects","grantNumber":"DP-140102164 and FT-130101457"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Representativeness and Informativeness for Active Learning","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhang-2496974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128765S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7779168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7779168","articleId":"7329991","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7329992,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Konstantopoulos","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas","Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7370751/7329992/konst-2495718-small.gif","p":["Christos Konstantopoulos (S\u201915) received the Engineering Diploma and M.Sc. degrees in electronic and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

However, wireless transmission of a massive amount of biologic EP signals (from one or multiple plants) is hindered by existing battery-operated wireless technology and increased associated monetary cost. In this paper, a self-powered batteryless EP wireless sensor is presented that harvests near-maximum energy from the plant itself and transmits the EP signal tens of meters away with a single switch, based on inherently low-cost and low-power bistatic scatter radio principles. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed wireless plant sensor to achieve a fully autonomous operation by harvesting the energy generated by the plant itself. In addition, EP signals experimentally acquired by the proposed wireless sensor from multiple plants have been processed using nonnegative matrix factorization, demonstrating a strong correlation with environmental light irradiation intensity and plant watering. The proposed low-cost batteryless plant-as-sensor-and-battery instrumentation approach is a first but solid step toward large-scale electrophysiology studies of important socioeconomic impact in ecology, plant biology, and precision agriculture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15684969","htmlLink":"/document/7329992/","displayDocTitle":"Converting a Plant to a Battery and Wireless Sensor with Scatter Radio and Ultra-Low Cost","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC-04-BLASE project, executed in the context of the Education and Lifelong Learning Program of General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) and funded through the European Union-European Social Fund and National Funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Converting a Plant to a Battery and Wireless Sensor with Scatter Radio and Ultra-Low Cost","sourcePdf":"tim-koutroulis-2495718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086116S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7370751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7370751","articleId":"7329992","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7329994,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7529107/7329994/wang-2500220-small.gif","p":["Wei-Yen Wang (M\u201900\u2013SM\u201904\u2013F\u201913) received\n the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the National Taipei Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, the\n M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,\n Taipei, in 1984, 1990, and 1994, respectively.","From 1990 to 2006, he worked concurrently as a Patent Screening Member of the National Intellectual Property Office,\n Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan.

A combination of multiple complementary features for HSR imagery scene classification is considered a potential way to improve the performance. However, the different types of features have different characteristics, and how to fuse the different types of features is a classic problem. In this paper, a Dirichlet-derived multiple topic model (DMTM) is proposed to fuse heterogeneous features at a topic level for HSR imagery scene classification. An efficient algorithm based on a variational expectation-maximization framework is developed to infer the DMTM and estimate the parameters of the DMTM. The proposed DMTM scene classification method is able to incorporate different types of features with different characteristics, no matter whether these features are local or global, discrete or continuous. Meanwhile, the proposed DMTM can also reduce the dimension of the features representing the HSR images. In our experiments, three types of heterogeneous features, i.e., the local spectral feature, the local structural feature, and the global textural feature, were employed. The experimental results with three different HSR imagery data sets show that the three types of features are complementary. In addition, the proposed DMTM is able to reduce the dimension of the features representing the HSR images, to fuse the different types of features efficiently, and to improve the performance of the scene classification over that of other scene classification algorithms based on spatial pyramid matching, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, and latent Dirichlet allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7430021/07329997.pdf","startPage":"2108","endPage":"2123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2496185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2496185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7329997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dirichlet-Derived Multiple Topic Scene Classification Model for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Fuses","Probabilistic logic","Buildings","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric optics","land use","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic latent semantic analysis","DMTM scene classification method","variational expectation-maximization framework","HSR imagery scene classification","Dirichlet-derived multiple topic model","high spatial resolution imagery scenes","remote sensing imagery","Dirichlet-derived multiple topic scene classification model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High spatial resolution (HSR)","latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)","multiple features","probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)","remote sensing","scene classification"]},{"kwd":["High spatial resolution (HSR)","latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)","multiple features","probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)","remote sensing","scene classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7329997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dirichlet-Derived Multiple Topic Scene Classification Model for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7329997/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837291","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41371344"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2042014kf00231"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology","grantNumber":"2015-KF-02"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1278"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dirichlet-Derived Multiple Topic Scene Classification Model for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhong-2496185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102678S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7430021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"7430021","articleId":"7329997","onlineDate":"17 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"}]
