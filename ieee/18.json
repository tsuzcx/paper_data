This expanded R/sub jc/ methodology is applied here to an actual plastic-leaded chip carrier (PLCC) package. Experimental data and the results of an extensive three-dimensional thermal simulation are used to establish the values of 11 sensitivity coefficients, which make it possible to determine the weighted average case temperature. The variations in the sensitivity coefficients and the accuracy of the chip temperature predictions, with the number of data sets used to determine the coefficients, are also examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/4507/00180032.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal characterization of a PLCC-expanded R/sub jc/ methodology","doi":"10.1109/33.180032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.180032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=180032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Thermal characterization of a PLCC-expanded R/sub jc/ methodology","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4364618","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal characterization of a PLCC-expanded R/sub jc/ methodology","sourcePdf":"00180032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049673S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"27","articleId":"180032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":180035,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

A scheme presented for solving these equations permits the determination of heat sink dimensions that display the lowest thermal resistance between the hottest portion of the heat sink and the incoming fluid. Results from the present method are applied to heat sinks reported by previous investigators to study effects of their restrictions regarding the nature of the flow (laminar or turbulent), the ratio of fin thickness to channel width, or the aspect ratio of the fluid channel. Results indicate that when the pressure drop through the channels is small, laminar solutions yield lower thermal resistance than turbulent solutions. Conversely, when the pressure drop is large, the optimal thermal resistance is found in the turbulent region. With the relaxation of these constraints, configurations and dimensions found using the present procedure produce significant improvement in thermal resistance over those presented by all three previous studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180049/","volume":"15","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4360510","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heat sink optimization with application to microchannels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heat sink optimization with application to microchannels","sourcePdf":"00180049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055953S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"275","articleId":"180049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":180055,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

This method overcomes the various difficulties due to numerous physical constraints faced by many heuristic routing algorithms. In the proposed approach, all the physical constraints are rigorously modeled in the constraint equations. Alternatives for all the nets are considered simultaneously with the routing environment, instead of being routed in a particular net-ordering. An optimal set of global paths routing all the nets is found with well established zero-one linear integer programming methods. The global router has run successfully on industrial SOG circuits, including 108,000 transistor circuits with 9400 nets, achieving 100% routing and high packing densities, which compare favorably with recently reported results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/4513/00180262.pdf","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.180262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.180262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=180262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new global router using zero-one integer linear programming techniques for sea-of-gates and custom logic arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integer linear programming","Routing","Programmable logic arrays","Logic programming","Circuits","Very large scale integration","Logic arrays","Linear programming","Wire"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","circuit layout CAD","integer programming","integrated circuit technology","linear programming","logic arrays","logic CAD","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global router","zero-one integer","linear programming","sea-of-gates","custom logic arrays","constraint equations","SOG circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"A new global router using zero-one integer linear programming techniques for sea-of-gates and custom logic arrays","volume":"11","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4354267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new global router using zero-one integer linear programming techniques for sea-of-gates and custom logic arrays","sourcePdf":"180262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042764S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"180262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":180283,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The scheme has a number of advantages over the classical control schemes and conventional adaptive control techniques. The dynamics of the controlled vehicle need not be fully known. The controller with the aid of a gain layer learns the dynamics and adapts fast to give the correct control action. The dynamic response and tracking performance could be accurately controlled by adjusting the network learning rate. A modified direct control scheme using multilayered neural network architecture is used in the studies with backpropagation as the learning algorithm. Results of simulation studies using nonlinear AUV dynamics are described in detail.

A variety of static neural network classifiers are evaluated and are shown to compare favorably with traditional statistical techniques for signal classification. The focus is on those networks that are able to time-out irrelevant input features and are less susceptible to noisy inputs, and two new neural-network-based classifiers are introduced.

Parallel networks are found to be very effective, and a parallel combination of two networks (feature fusion), one trained on the original data and the other trained on the data preprocessed through a peak detector, performs significantly better than either network acting alone. In the test cases, over 90% of the targets were identified correctly by the parallel combination. In the simpler detection problem, where the objective is only to detect the presence of fish and not make a complete identification, success rates of over 98% were obtained using a parallel combination as described above.

The network is used as a classifier of detected hydroacoustic signals. It converts the signals into one of a possible alphabet of symbols. The algorithm used is a Hamming-type neural network classifier associated with the transmission of a Hamming code. This system can detect and correct all transmission errors if the number of errors is less than or equal to half the Hamming distance between transmitted symbols minus one. Symbols to be transmitted are chosen and associated to messages, assuring that bit-to-bit nonsimilarities result on the prescribed Hamming distance. The auto-associative error correcting scheme can be used to generate a teaching signal to a supervised learning equalizer tracking the channel nonstationary characteristics. The proposed system is intended for use in hydroacoustic communication applications and is undergoing sea tests.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.180306","startPage":"369","endPage":"375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/4515/00180306.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.180306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network error corrector for binary messages on hydro-acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Error correction","Hamming distance","Signal detection","Character generation","Signal generators","Education","Supervised learning","Equalizers","Underwater communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","binary sequences","error correction codes","feedforward neural nets","Hamming codes","learning systems","telecommunications computing","tracking","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocean sound propagation","binary messages","hydro-acoustic channels","neural networks","identification","correction","transmission errors","classifier","hydroacoustic signals","Hamming code","Hamming distance","auto-associative error correcting","teaching signal","supervised learning equalizer","tracking","channel nonstationary characteristics","hydroacoustic communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural network error corrector for binary messages on hydro-acoustic channels","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4320866","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network error corrector for binary messages on hydro-acoustic channels","sourcePdf":"00180306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05483S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","articleId":"180306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":180341,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

This approach impairs the performance of online transaction processing systems, especially when a large volatile memory is used. An incremental scheme for performing recovery in main memory database systems (MMDBs), in parallel with transaction execution, is presented. A page-based incremental restart algorithm that enables the resumption of transaction processing as soon as the system is up is proposed. Pages are recovered individually and according to the demands of the post-crash transactions. A method for propagating updates from main memory to the backup database on disk is also provided. The emphasis is on decoupling the I/O activities related to the propagation to disk from the forward transaction execution in memory. The authors also construct a high-level recovery manager based on operation logging on top of the page-based algorithms. The proposed algorithms are motivated by the characteristics of large MMDBs, and exploit the technology of nonvolatile RAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.180604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/4527/00180604.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.180604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental recovery in main memory database systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Incremental recovery in main memory database systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4357025","volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental recovery in main memory database systems","sourcePdf":"00180604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033284S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"37","articleId":"180604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":180605,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.G.

A discrete-time Markov chain model of its network architecture is developed to compute the message delay introduced by the network architecture. Due to the synchronous time-division multiplexing nature of the network operation, it is amenable to a discrete-time Markov chain modeling. The analysis yields formulas for response time and several other related performance measures, showing how the performance of the network degrades with the message arrival rate and other parameters. Since the communication delays affect interprocess communication, knowledge of the sensitivity of the delays to the parameters can be a useful aid in designing a high performance parallel system. To keep the analysis tractable, an approximate Markov model is used that requires the use of fixed-point iteration for its solution. Validation of the results against a simulation study reveals that the analysis predicts the performance of the network with high accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of the communication architecture of the Connection Machine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.180627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/4528/00180627.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.180627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=180627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/180627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of the communication architecture of the Connection Machine","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4340018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of the communication architecture of the Connection Machine","sourcePdf":"00180627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054687S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"3","articleId":"180627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":180672,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

This paper reviews previous work and describes a high efficiency (72%) 0.5 watt distributed Class E power amplifier operating at 1 GHz. Class E amplifiers are a type of switching amplifier where the losses normally associated with the 'shorting out' of the device shunt capacitance are negated by designing the load network to define the voltage across the switching device when it is off. These amplifiers unlike class C amplifiers offer the potential of 100% efficiency with a specified output power. To obtain minimum losses the voltage across the switch, when it is off, is arranged to ring and fall back to zero just before the switch turns on again. The design criteria for the voltage are: the voltage rises slowly at switch off; the voltage falls to zero by the end of the half-cycle; and the voltage has a zero rate of change at the end of the half cycle. A typical circuit is shown and it consists of a bias choke, a (transistor) switch, a shunt capacitor which incorporates the parasitic capacitance of the device, a series tuned LCR resonant circuit with an extra series reactance (inductance) which sets the load angle to obtain correct collector voltage waveform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16 Dec 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4107269","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Highly efficient class E amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly efficient class E amplifiers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00182341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022613S","chronDate":"16 Dec 1991","isNumber":"4662","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1532","citationCount":"2","articleId":"182341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":182350,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The dependency among the servers is described by the definition of their subsets that can be activated simultaneously. Multihop radio networks provide a motivation for the consideration of this system. The problem of scheduling the server activation under the constraints imposed by the dependency among servers is studied. The performance criterion of a scheduling policy is its throughput that is characterized by its stability region, that is, the set of vectors of arrival and service rates for which the system is stable. A policy is obtained which is optimal in the sense that its stability region is a superset of the stability region of every other scheduling policy, and this stability region is characterized. The behavior of the network is studied for arrival rates that lie outside the stability region. Implications of the results in certain types of concurrent database and parallel processing systems are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.182479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.182479","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/4671/00182479.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability properties of constrained queueing systems and scheduling policies for maximum throughput in multihop radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Stability properties of constrained queueing systems and scheduling policies for maximum throughput in multihop radio networks","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4374499","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability properties of constrained queueing systems and scheduling policies for maximum throughput in multihop radio networks","sourcePdf":"00182479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111983S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"1874","articleId":"182479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":182580,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

In VHF air/ground communication systems, a radio line of sight (RLOS) between the aircraft and ground station must exist. The frequency reuse distance is reduced by using the radio horizon to block cochannel interferences. In the proposed system, cells of different sizes to cover different altitude ranges are separated by different reuse distances. With nine groups of channels, the altitude range from 740 ft to 45000 ft can be covered without interference. The proposed system utilizes the spectrum efficiently by covering a certain airspace according to a well-organized plan with the minimum number of frequency channels and cell sites. Thus, it has more frequency reuse than the current systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182580.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional cellular systems for aeronautical mobile radio communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182580/","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional cellular systems for aeronautical mobile radio communications","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4374571","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional cellular systems for aeronautical mobile radio communications","sourcePdf":"00182580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045655S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"182580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":182583,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The outage is defined as the probability that the signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) is less than a power protection ratio. The analysis considers L-branch equal gain (EG), selection (SC), and switched (SW) diversity combining schemes. The analyses are not limited to a single interferer, but rather assume the presence of multiple independent cochannel interferers. Previous results have used some approximations to study the performance of the EG combiner. A precise method is used to analyze the performance of an L-branch EG combiner. Selection diversity combining using the total power algorithm, the desired power algorithm, and the signal-to-interference power algorithm is analyzed. The effects of diversity on the reuse factor and on the spectrum efficiency of cellular mobile radio systems are considered in detail. The results for the Rayleigh fading channel are obtained and presented as a special case of the generalized Nakagami fading model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182583.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probabilities of diversity cellular systems with cochannel interference in Nakagami fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Outage probabilities of diversity cellular systems with cochannel interference in Nakagami fading","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4374574","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probabilities of diversity cellular systems with cochannel interference in Nakagami fading","sourcePdf":"00182583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046617S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"96","articleId":"182583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":182584,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

Such an approach avoids a Gaussian characterization of interference and yields results for both ideal interleaving and no interleaving. With dual space diversity, three taps per forward filter, and a data rate of 10 Mb/s, it is shown that, although a third space diversity branch remains preferable in terms of performance, channel coding can be a viable alternative, particularly in terms of outage rate, to increasing the space diversity order, even in the absence of interleaving, provided the signal-to-interference ratio is sufficiently high.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182586.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","startPage":"369","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compound strategies of coding, equalization, and space diversity for wide-band TDMA indoor wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compound strategies of coding, equalization, and space diversity for wide-band TDMA indoor wireless channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4374577","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compound strategies of coding, equalization, and space diversity for wide-band TDMA indoor wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00182586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063697S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"38","articleId":"182586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":182588,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

When the conventional (PSK-type) differentially coherent detector is used, a large performance degradation, compared with that of coherent receiver, is observed. The reason for this is the presence of an inherent intersymbol interference (ISI) in the signal and also noise enhancement and correlation introduced by the receiver filter. A differential detection strategy which compensates for ISI and avoids noise enhancement is presented. A phase estimate that takes into account the presence of the inherent ISI is derived. This phase estimate is then used in the decision metric of a coherent receiver. The resulting decision rule can be implemented using the Viterbi algorithm.

Mobile communication networks are evolving towards microcellulars operating in narrowband TDMA and microwave bands to meet the rapidly increasing demands for both voice and data services. Therefore, synthesizers with high switching speed are required for the realization. However, it will be difficult for conventional synthesizers to provide switching times of shorter than 1 ms. The PLL synthesizer proposed is composed entirely of digital signal processors except for a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The VCO control signal is derived by the subtraction of the linear reference phase and the feedback phase; therefore, it does not need the band-limited loop filter which limits the ability of the loop to switch fast. The experimental results show that it can provide switching times as short as 0.1 ms, which is 10/sup 2/ approximately 10/sup 3/ times higher than conventional PLL synthesizers, and spurs of less than -60 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182591.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new PLL frequency synthesizer with high switching speed","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182591/","displayDocTitle":"A new PLL frequency synthesizer with high switching speed","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4374582","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new PLL frequency synthesizer with high switching speed","sourcePdf":"00182591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040352S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","articleId":"182591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":182593,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

A quadrature modulation with +or- pi /2 phase rotation within one symbol period, which is the case for MSK, is assumed. An analytic expression is derived for the error probability as a function of the ratio of the average energies of the relevant symbol and the preceding interfering symbols. This interference is caused by the channel time dispersion. The error probability lies between an upper and a lower bound with a margin that never exceeds 3 dB. The upper bound error probability turns out to be almost identical to the cochannel interference as calculated by the model of K. Hirade et al. (1979). Using typical delay power profiles of European propagation environments, the authors calculate error probability versus symbol duration. For bad-urban and hilly-terrain cases, in which error bursts may last for a few milliseconds, several tens to several hundreds of successive symbols will be corrupted, unless proper signal recovery measures are taken.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"438","endPage":"447","doi":"10.1109/25.182595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182595","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182595.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of intersymbol-interference in a Rayleigh fast fading channel with typical delay power profiles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of intersymbol-interference in a Rayleigh fast fading channel with typical delay power profiles","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4379379","volume":"41","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of intersymbol-interference in a Rayleigh fast fading channel with typical delay power profiles","sourcePdf":"00182595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031455S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"182595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":182598,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This allows the efficient simulation of the continuous-time channel with, e.g., only one sample per symbol, and without explicit digital filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182598.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical discrete-time model for the WSSUS multipath channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"A statistical discrete-time model for the WSSUS multipath channel","volume":"41","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4379382","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182598/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical discrete-time model for the WSSUS multipath channel","sourcePdf":"00182598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020973S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"456","articleId":"182598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":182600,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mokhtar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"38275601000"},{"name":"S.C.

The correlation between successive received symbols is exploited to bound the error performance. The bound allows useful evaluation of coding gains on realistic communication systems without going into lengthy computer simulations. By further defining the maximum energy degradation factors, compact upper bounds are expressed in a similar way as on the fully interleaved or memoryless channels. The maximum energy degradation factors are computed for a wide variety of mobile channel conditions. These factors give an interesting evaluation of the fading conditions and may be used to design coded communication systems on mobile channels. Furthermore, independent space or frequency diversity may be taken into account in these bounds and it is shown that the energy degradation due to correlation is independent of this added independent diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182601","startPage":"488","endPage":"495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182601.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of error control coding with diversity for mobile channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of error control coding with diversity for mobile channels","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4379385","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182601/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of error control coding with diversity for mobile channels","sourcePdf":"00182601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034471S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","articleId":"182601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":182602,"authors":[{"name":"W.

One feature is the clear space between ceiling and furnishings or floor that results in excess attenuation of the signal. A second feature is reflection and transmission at interior and exterior walls. Diffraction at corners and propagation along the exterior wall are also shown to be a significant means for radiation to reach the receivers.

The lower bounds of the bit error probability are found for errors-only and for errors-and-erasures decoding. For the soft-decision decoding the upper bound of the bit error rate is derived. The error bounds are calculated and examined by simulation for some RS-coded MPSK schemes on a shadowed Rician channel. It is shown that their performance is significantly improved compared to uncoded QPSK. The amount of improvement depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the decoding strategy, and the degree of shadowing. A comparison between different decoding techniques, for one of the RS-coded schemes, for different degrees of shadowing shows that the use of channel measurement information in the decoding process is more effective for heavy shadowed channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182603.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"515","doi":"10.1109/25.182603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of different decoding strategies for a bandwidth-efficient block-coded scheme on mobile radio channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of different decoding strategies for a bandwidth-efficient block-coded scheme on mobile radio channels","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4379387","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of different decoding strategies for a bandwidth-efficient block-coded scheme on mobile radio channels","sourcePdf":"00182603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03683S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"182603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":182604,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Expressions are derived relating the out-of-band spectra to these misalignments and to the complex coefficients of the power series describing the amplifier. For most applications the adjacent channel leakage is proportional to the square of the misalignment error (carrier leak, differential gain, differential phase and level error) except in the case of some higher order products of continuous phase modulations (CPM). A technique for estimating the spectrum for the above situations is described. It involves summing the weighted spectrum of each distortion product. The weighting coefficients can be varied to account for amplifier characteristics, backoff, and misalignment error. The analysis is applicable to linear or continuous phase modulations with or without predistortion. The spectrum estimate is particularly good for continuous phase modulated signals where the error is normally much less than 1 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.182604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4674/00182604.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.182604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral sensitivity of power amplifiers to quadrature modulator misalignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182604/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral sensitivity of power amplifiers to quadrature modulator misalignment","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4379388","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral sensitivity of power amplifiers to quadrature modulator misalignment","sourcePdf":"00182604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032915S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","articleId":"182604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":182606,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

The genetic algorithm is shown to possess the ability to reject plant noise and other system anomalies in its search for optimizing solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.182643","startPage":"623","endPage":"630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.182643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/4676/00182643.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182643/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4321755","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00182643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02956S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"44","articleId":"182643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":182648,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

The main purposes for using dynamic air gap monitoring are to assist in minimizing loss of revenue through preventing the loss of rotor-to-stator air gap, and to aid in the maintenance and maintenance scheduling of large hydroelectric generators. The authors discuss the air gap measuring principle, the technique, and the equipment used. They also include several case studies in which dynamic air gap measurement data was analyzed and correlated to generator performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/4676/00182648.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.182648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.182648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vertical hydraulic generators experience with dynamic air gap monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Hydroelectric power generation","Condition monitoring","Air gaps","Costs","Stator cores","Senior members","Timing","Power generation","Power & Energy Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance measurement","hydroelectric generators","machine testing","maintenance engineering","monitoring","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine testing","distance measurement","dynamic air gap monitoring","rotor-to-stator distance","salient pole hydroelectric generator","maintenance","scheduling","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Vertical hydraulic generators experience with dynamic air gap monitoring","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4321760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical hydraulic generators experience with dynamic air gap monitoring","sourcePdf":"00182648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040026S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"37","articleId":"182648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":182651,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-Y.

In the ANN those system variables, such as generator loadings and the capacitor compensation ratio, which have major impact on the damping characteristics of torsional oscillation modes were used as the inputs. The outputs of the neural net provided the desired eigenvalues for torsional modes. Once the connection weights of the neural network have been learned using a set of training data derived offline, the neural network can be applied to torsional analysis in real-time situations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural net, torsional analysis was performed on the IEEE First Benchmark Model.

A full factorial statistical test was devised and performed on 180 pure epoxy insulation specimens to examine the effect of voltage magnitude, polarity, and surge repetition rate on the life of unfilled epoxy specimens containing a needle-plane electrode geometry. All factors and interactions were determined to have a significant effect on the life, and life prediction equations were estimated. Increasing the voltage magnitude or repetition rate, decreased or increased the life, respectively. Aging was found to occur at as low a stress as 2 MV/cm. Gradual aging of the epoxy does occur under repetitive voltage surges. Based on a realistic number of surges with typical voltage amplitudes which can normally occur from vacuum switchgear during service, gradual deterioration of the epoxy turn insulation in motor stator windings is possible in some situations. Situations where surge aging may occur are identified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/4676/00182659.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.182659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.182659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the effect of repetitive voltage surges on epoxy insulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Surges","Aging","Gas insulation","Switchgear","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Life testing","Insulation testing","Performance evaluation","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","electric breakdown of solids","failure analysis","insulation testing","machine insulation","organic insulating materials","polymers","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine insulation","insulation testing","GIS","reliability","electric breakdown of solids","repetitive voltage surges","epoxy insulation","premature failure","motor windings","gas insulated switchgear spacers","needle-plane electrode geometry","life","voltage magnitude","repetition rate","aging","stator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the effect of repetitive voltage surges on epoxy insulation","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4321771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the effect of repetitive voltage surges on epoxy insulation","sourcePdf":"00182659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064531S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"43","articleId":"182659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":182661,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The robot maps the environment only to the extent necessary to achieve the goal. Mapping is achieved using tactile sensing while the robot is executing a path to the specified goal. Paths are generated by treating unknown regions in the environment as free space. As obstacles are encountered en route to a goal, the model of the environment is updated and a new path to the goal is planned and executed. Initially the paths to the goal generated by this algorithm will be negotiable paths. However, as the robot acquires more knowledge about the environment, the length of the planned paths will be optimized. The optimization criteria can be modified to favor or avoid unexplored regions in the environment.

Using minor variations of the standard backpropagation learning procedure, the complex mapping of hand movements to speech is learned using data obtained from a single 'speaker' in a simple training phase. With a 203 gesture-to-word vocabulary, the wrong word is produced less than 1% of the time, and no word is produced about 5% of the time. Adaptive control of the speaking rate and word stress is also available. The training times and final performance speed are improved by using small, separate networks for each naturally defined subtask. The system demonstrates that neural networks can be used to develop the complex mappings required in a high bandwidth interface that adapts to the individual user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.182690","startPage":"2","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4678/00182690.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.182690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Glove-Talk: a neural network interface between a data-glove and a speech synthesizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Speech synthesis","Adaptive systems","Synthesizers","Backpropagation","Vocabulary","Adaptive control","Stress","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","handicapped aids","interactive devices","learning systems","neural nets","peripheral interfaces","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand movements to speech mapping","learning systems","handicapped aids","Glove-Talk","neural network interface","speech synthesizer","VPL Data-Glove","DECtalk","hand-gesture","backpropagation learning","vocabulary","high bandwidth interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Glove-Talk: a neural network interface between a data-glove and a speech synthesizer","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4366011","pubMedId":"18267698","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glove-Talk: a neural network interface between a data-glove and a speech synthesizer","sourcePdf":"00182690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030871S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"4678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"195","articleId":"182690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":182695,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The problem of rejection of input disturbances, when such networks are used in practical problems is considered. A large class of disturbances, which can be modeled as the outputs of unforced linear or nonlinear dynamic systems, is treated. The objective is to determine the identification model and the control law to minimize the effect of the disturbance at the output. In all cases, the method used involves expansion of the state space of the disturbance-free plant in an attempt to eliminate the effect of the disturbance. Several stages of increasing complexity of the problem are discussed in detail. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of solutions to the problem of complete rejection of the disturbance in special cases. This provides the rationale for using similar techniques in situations where such theoretical analysis is not available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.182696","startPage":"63","endPage":"72","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4678/00182696.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.182696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance rejection in nonlinear systems using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Multi-layer neural network","Artificial neural networks","Gradient methods","Robust control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","identification","neural nets","nonlinear systems","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disturbance rejection","neural networks","identification","nonlinear dynamic systems","state space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance rejection in nonlinear systems using neural networks","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4366017","pubMedId":"18267704","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance rejection in nonlinear systems using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00182696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040549S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"4678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"67","articleId":"182696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":182697,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

For the purpose of analysis, the wavelet formulation characterizes a class of mappings which can be implemented by feedforward networks as well as reveals an exact implementation of a given mapping in this class.

The second algorithm employs an extended self-organizing feature map algorithm. Based on visual information provided by two cameras, the robot learns to position its end effector without an external teacher. Within only 3000 training steps, the robot-camera system is capable of reducing the positioning error of the robot's end effector to approximately 0.1% of the linear dimension of the work space. By employing adaptive feedback the robot succeeds in compensating not only slow calibration drifts, but also sudden changes in its geometry.

This problem is addressed by proposing a network architecture, called the hidden control neural network (HCNN), for modeling signals generated by nonlinear dynamical systems with restricted time variability. The mapping implemented by a multilayered neural network is allowed to change with time as a function of an additional control input signal. The network is trained using an algorithm based on 'backpropagation' and segmentation algorithms for estimating the unknown control together with the network's parameters.

The network is applied to two phase-sensitive problems: interpretation of chaotic oscillator phase plane plots, and eddy current defect detection and characterization. In chaotic oscillator analysis, the network, in conjunction with the oscillator, demonstrates the ability to interpret small signal behavior. In eddy current impedance plane analysis, the network demonstrates a clear performance advantage over both real-valued multilayer feedforward networks (MFFNs) and human subjects, with overall classification accuracy improvements of 45% (to a 99% level) and 48%, respectively. This network structure and learning algorithm should provide similar results in other signal processing applications where time or phase considerations are critical for class discrimination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.182703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4678/00182703.pdf","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complex mapping network for phase sensitive classification","doi":"10.1109/72.182703","startPage":"127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A complex mapping network for phase sensitive classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/182703/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4366023","pubMedId":"18267710","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complex mapping network for phase sensitive classification","sourcePdf":"00182703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036116S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"4678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","articleId":"182703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":182704,"authors":[{"name":"J. de Villiers","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"J.","lastName":"de Villiers","id":"37284614500"},{"name":"E.

Tuples of a large base relation denote edges in a graph, which models a transportation network. A fragmentation algorithm is proposed which produces a partitioning of the base relation into several fragments such that any fragment corresponds to a subgraph. One fragment, called high-speed fragment, collects all edges which guarantee maximum speed. Thus, the fragmentation algorithm induces a hierarchical relationship between the high-speed fragment and all other fragments. With this fragmentation, any query about paths connecting two nodes can be answered by using just the fragments in which nodes are located and the high-speed fragment. In general, if each fragment is managed by a distinguished processor, then the query can be answered by three processors working in parallel. This schema can be applied recursively to generate an arbitrary number of hierarchical levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PDIS.1991.183080","startPage":"130","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the First International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the First International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/371/4715/00183080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDIS.1991.183080","endPage":"137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel hierarchical evaluation of transitive closure queries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/183080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Parallel hierarchical evaluation of transitive closure queries","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4244127","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel hierarchical evaluation of transitive closure queries","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00183080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030453S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","isNumber":"4715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"371","citationCount":"31","articleId":"183080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":183157,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

It accelerates gravitational force calculations which are the most expensive part of the many-body simulations. The peak computing speed is equivalent to about 15 GFLOPS. The GRAPE-3 system consists of two identical boards connected to a host computer through a VME bus. Each board has 24 custom LSI GRAPE chips which calculate gravitational forces in parallel. The gravitational force calculation is easily parallelized because the forces on different particles con be calculated independently. Using the pipelined architecture, one GRAPE chip calculates one gravitational force between a pair of particles at every clock cycle. The number of floating point operations needed to calculate one force is about 90. Therefore, one GRAPE chip running at 10 MHz clock-rate has a computing speed equivalent to 0.3 GFLOPS. The GRAPE-3 with 48 GRAPE chips achieves about 15 GFLOPS. One GRAPE chip has 110000 transistors in an 8 mm*8 mm area and its power consumption is 1.2 W at 10 MHz. Its package is ceramic PGA with 181 pins. One GRAPE-3 board is a 9U Eurocard, on which 159 chips are wire-wrapped.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRAPE-3: highly parallelized special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1992.183157","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/378/4716/00183157.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"160 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1992.183157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=183157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/183157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"GRAPE-3: highly parallelized special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4244224","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRAPE-3: highly parallelized special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00183157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035069S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan 1992","isNumber":"4716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"378","citationCount":"5","articleId":"183157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":183181,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Realized as an add-in coprocessor board, the SPR provides for a significant performance gain in existing computer architectures. Improved performance is obtained by migration of low-level non-numeric DBMS functions into hardware. The paper presents the basic architecture of a prototype version of the SPR and the hardware support for SORT, SELECT, PROJECT and JOIN operations. A SORT operation is based on the implementation of the improved recursive radix-sort method. Relational data base operations make use of equivalence classes (E-class) generated by the SPR during the basic radix sort or hashing operations. Performance measures given are obtained using the realized prototype SPR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1992.183181","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/378/4716/00183181.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"337 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1992.183181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of some DBMS functions using SPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=183181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/183181/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of some DBMS functions using SPR","volume":"i","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4244242","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of some DBMS functions using SPR","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00183181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038443S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan 1992","isNumber":"4716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"378","citationCount":"3","articleId":"183181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":183199,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

What is needed, is a technique that has discovered the most 'natural' groups in a data set.

Such an approach results in a significant cost reduction while maintaining a reasonable suboptimal processing speed for databases of practical interest. As an added benefit, the proposed designs offer considerable flexibility in the handling of variable-length and very long records. Such records are impossible to handle or lead to intolerable performance penalties with fixed-format designs. A key to the proposed architecture is the coupling of high-speed shift registers with systolic string comparators that can operate at extremely high clock rates. The speed/cost tradeoffs provided by various architectural features of the proposed system are discussed and its performance is compared to those of certain theoretically optimal, but currently unrealizable hardware-intensive architectures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The mixed serial/parallel approach to VLSI search processors","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1991.183887","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/882/4721/00183887.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"211 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1991.183887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=183887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/183887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"The mixed serial/parallel approach to VLSI search processors","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4120678","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The mixed serial/parallel approach to VLSI search processors","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00183887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141287S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","isNumber":"4721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"882","articleId":"183887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":183888,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The memory concept is based on a simple matrix structure with n*m binary elements, the connections, and on distributed storage of information like artificial neural networks. There is no asynchronous feedback and the inputs and outputs are binary, too. Though the system concept is very simple, it has an asymptotic storage capacity of 0.69.m.n bits and the number of patterns that can be stored with low error probability is much larger than the number of columns (artificial neurons).

Novel methods to circumvent these limitations are suggested: hybrid optical/electronic systems neural network algorithms specifically formatted to match to digital semiconductor chips; fine grained parallel simulators using a novel neuron value transfer; and massive analog semiconductor chips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/183916/","accessionNumber":"4120704","isConference":true,"volume":"i","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network hardware: what does the future hold?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network hardware: what does the future hold?","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00183916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056464S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","isNumber":"4721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"882","articleId":"183916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":184052,"authors":[{"name":"L.

They are claimed to possess the property to learn from a set of data without the need for a full specification of the decision model; they are believed to automatically provide any needed data transformations. They are also claimed to be able to see through noise and distortion. An empirical study evaluating the performance of neural network models on data generated from three known regression models is presented. The results of this study indicate that neural network models perform best under conditions of high noise and low sample size. With less noise or larger sample sizes, they become less competitive. However, in two of the three cases, the neural network models were able to maintain mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) within 2% of those of the true model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1991.184052","pdfPath":"/iel2/882/4723/00184052.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"135 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1991.184052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network models as an alternative to regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network models as an alternative to regression","isConference":true,"volume":"iv","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4127548","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network models as an alternative to regression","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00184052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034742S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","isNumber":"4723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"882","citationCount":"14","articleId":"184052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":184053,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Neural network-like algorithms are capable of implementing this approach. Such tools are able to automatically build optimal structures similar to financial ratios. Some results are presented. They suggest that this approach effectively avoids the search of appropriate ratios by the analyst along with some other major drawbacks of the multivariate statistical modelling techniques used in accountancy. The organization of the neural network models also outlines internal features of accounting data, providing new insights into the relative importance of variables for modelling a particular relation. The paper also argues that, in the accounting and finance context, a major problem of neural networks, that of understandability of the resulting parameters, is minimised. Much of the internal operation of the networks involves the construction of generalisations of the ratio concepts with which accountants are familiar.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1991.184053","pdfPath":"/iel2/882/4723/00184053.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"146 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1991.184053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of neural network based methods to the extraction of knowledge from accounting reports","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"The application of neural network based methods to the extraction of knowledge from accounting reports","isConference":true,"volume":"iv","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4127549","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of neural network based methods to the extraction of knowledge from accounting reports","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00184053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068238S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1991","isNumber":"4723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"882","citationCount":"8","articleId":"184053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":184054,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Simulation results also display the effectiveness of adaptive DF filters for suppressing FM interference in QAM systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of FM interference in QAM systems using adaptive decision-feedback filters","publicationTitle":"China., 1991 International Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CICCAS.1991.184308","displayPublicationTitle":"China., 1991 International Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/887/4725/00184308.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"163 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICCAS.1991.184308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=184308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of FM interference in QAM systems using adaptive decision-feedback filters","conferenceDate":"16-17 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4259868","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of FM interference in QAM systems using adaptive decision-feedback filters","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"00184308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038148S","chronDate":"16-17 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"887","citationCount":"2","articleId":"184308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":184309,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Jie","affiliation":["Radio Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"lastName":"Xu Jie","id":"37087193505"}],"articleNumber":"184309","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"abstract":"Based on Carlin's (see IEEE Trans.

Avoiding the time consuming task of solving the zeroes of polynomials which is necessary in Carlin's theory, POT realizes the optimum design of equalizers by directly optimizing the poles of the network admittance function, and experiences show that it is particularly applicable to multistage design.

The basic idea is derived from noting that an oversampled (delta sigma) flow represents a signal in two different fashions; an analogue representation since it keeps the signal information in its low frequency range and a digital representation since it is made of a 1 bit high speed bit stream. Simple manipulations of such digital streams will give rise to a suitable processing of their low frequency (analogue) contents. The paper shows how to get some basic functions: addition, subtraction and multiplication; moreover some examples of practical data processing are considered.

The method is proceeded on the principle that before the demodulation the BPSK signals are translated into other signal waveforms which can be simply demodulated. In the scheme, the author suggests two new coherent demodulation techniques for BPSK signals which get round the phase ambiguity of recovered carriers as exist in conventional coherent demodulation techniques and simultaneously give the timing clock signals for symbol decisions. The circuitry configurations suggested here are relatively simple. The transformed signals can also be differentially detected with nonredundant error correction, and thus improving the system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICCAS.1991.184385","publicationTitle":"China., 1991 International Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"China., 1991 International Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/887/4725/00184385.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"451 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICCAS.1991.184385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative coherent demodulation scheme for BPSK signals-signal transform method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=184385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184385/","displayDocTitle":"An alternative coherent demodulation scheme for BPSK signals-signal transform method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4269856","conferenceDate":"16-17 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative coherent demodulation scheme for BPSK signals-signal transform method","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"00184385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035763S","chronDate":"16-17 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"887","articleId":"184385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":184387,"authors":[{"name":"Furonng Zhao","affiliation":["Technical Department, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Furonng Zhao","id":"37087582046"},{"name":"Yihe Yang","affiliation":["Technical Department, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yihe Yang","id":"37087580940"},{"name":"Jianyong Xiang","affiliation":["Technical Department, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jianyong Xiang","id":"37087584826"},{"name":"Weizhen Zhou","affiliation":["Technical Department, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Weizhen Zhou","id":"37087580703"}],"articleNumber":"184387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=184387","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Target recognition","Real time systems","Target tracking","Interference","Jamming","Image recognition","Fires","Clouds","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","computerised picture processing","microwave imaging","military computing","military systems","parallel processing","radar systems","real-time systems","telecommunications computing","tracking systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air-to-air target location","DSP","image guidance system","grating scanning","air target recognition","online segmentation","labelling circuit","parallel feature extraction circuit","TMS32020","digital signal processor"]}],"abstract":"The authors present an air-to-air real-time target recognition and location system.

The basic building block, a 5-volt fully-differential current-mode operational amplifier (I-OPAMP), has been integrated using the MOSIS 2 mu m n-well CMOS technology. Measured total harmonic distortion (THD) is -70 dB with a peak signal (i) to bias current (I) ratio of 0.5. By simply adding MOS switches, the I-OPAMP topology is easily extended to implement fully-differential switched-current (SI) circuits with first-order cancellation of clock-feedthrough effects. A five-pole Chebyshev lowpass fully-differential SI ladder filter has also been integrated in a 2 mu m p-well CMOS technology. Measured results show that with a sampling frequency of 128 kHz, the desired ripple bandwidth of 5 kHz is accurately realized using the fully-differential SI structure.

The electrode interface impedance components (R/sub i/, X/sub i/) and the culture medium component R/sub m/ were separated by making use of the Warburg's model frequency dependent properties. Measurements were carried out from 18 Hz to 18 kHz with a constant current impedance bridge as growth proceeded. Growth curves for R/sub i/ and X/sub i/ showed a similar temporal pattern within the frequency range of 18-100 Hz. Dispersion was not observed in R/sub m/, meaning that the same growth response was obtained within the 18-18000-Hz range. At low frequency, the resistive and capacitive reactive components, or R/sub i/ and X/sub b/, respectively, were directly measured, where R/sub b/=(2*R/sub i/+R/sub m/) and X/sub b/=2*X/sub i/ and, above 5 kHz, R/sub m/ was obtained (for Z/sub i/ is negligible). Thus, R/sub i/ was easily discriminated from R/sub m/ by simple arithmetic. In four experiments, the maximum spread of X/sub i/, R/sub i/, and R/sub m/ was smaller than 5% indicating good repeatability. There is potential new information in dissecting out the growth curve in three separate component curves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.184708","startPage":"1310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4729/00184708.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.184708","endPage":"1313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance bacteriometry: medium and interface contributions during bacterial growth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Impedance bacteriometry: medium and interface contributions during bacterial growth","volume":"39","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4355313","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","pubMedId":"1487295","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance bacteriometry: medium and interface contributions during bacterial growth","sourcePdf":"00184708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078979S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"4729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"27","articleId":"184708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":184791,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Two algorithms have been developed using a neural network, and their performances are compared with that of the repair most (RM) algorithm. For randomly generated defect patterns, a proposed algorithm with a hill-climbing capability successfully repaired memory arrays in 98% cases, as opposed to RMs 20% cases. It is demonstrated how, by using very small silicon overhead, one can implement this algorithm in hardware within a VLSI chip for built in self repair (BISR) of memory arrays. The proposed auto-repair approach is shown to improve the VLSI chip yield by a significant factor, and it can also improve the life span of the chip by automatically restructuring its memory arrays in the event of sporadic cell failures during the field use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4383446","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A new built-in self-repair approach to VLSI memory yield enhancement by using neural-type circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new built-in self-repair approach to VLSI memory yield enhancement by using neural-type circuits","sourcePdf":"184849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04496S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"27","articleId":"184849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":184851,"authors":[{"name":"W.-B.

Results demonstrate that elaborate selection of nonsensitizing test pattern guarantees the detection of all multiple stuck-at faults using single stuck-at test experiments. The algorithm is deterministic, and will produce test sets for tree circuits containing any mixture of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.

Pulse frequency (repetition rate of laser pulses or modulation rate) can, in theory, be used to identify signals from individual customers. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that the particular pulse frequency could be better controlled electrically than the particular optical frequency of semiconductor lasers. It is asynchronous, which is another advantage over time division multiplexing systems.

A performance modeling technique based on a semi-Markov analytic model, which eliminates many of the unrealistic assumptions of past approaches, is introduced. The performance of the protocol is analyzed using this model and discrete-event simulation. Control channel access arbitration is achieved through time-division multiplexing (TDM), enabling all active nodes to transmit once every control cycle. The long synchronization delays typical of TDM systems are significantly reduced, because the control cycle length is proportional to the control packet size rather than the data packet size.

Assuming ideal amplifiers spaced at 100 km and compensation of fiber dispersion at the receiver end, the performances of a 2.5-Gb/s 15-channel system are compared for conventional and dispersion-shifted fibers. For 1 mW per channel and 12.5-GHz channel separation, FWM leads to a channel averaged power penalty of 3.3 dB (up to 7 dB in particular channels) after 800 km in a conventional fiber, and 8 dB after only 300 km in the dispersion-shifted fiber. As expected, an increase of channel separation from 12.5 to to 37.5 GHz leads to improved system performance for both types of fibers. The improvement is, however, limited by modulation instability occurring in the individual channels so that for very large channel separations a better system performance is achieved using dispersion-shifted fibers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Four-wave mixing","Frequency","Optical receivers","Optical fiber communication","System performance","Phase modulation","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","multiwave mixing","optical dispersion","optical links","optical modulation","phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power limitations","FDM","light coherence","four-wave mixing effects","frequency division multiplexed coherent systems","cascaded optical amplifiers","phase modulated","coherent multichannel systems","long-haul communications systems","ideal amplifiers","compensation","fiber dispersion","receiver end","15-channel system","dispersion-shifted fibers","channel separation","channel averaged power penalty","system performance","modulation instability","100 km","2.5 Gbit/s","1 mW","300 km","800 km"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.184915","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4738/00184915.pdf","startPage":"1715","endPage":"1721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.184915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power limitations due to four-wave mixing effects in frequency division multiplexed coherent systems using cascaded optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=184915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power limitations due to four-wave mixing effects in frequency division multiplexed coherent systems using cascaded optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/184915/","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4379062","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power limitations due to four-wave mixing effects in frequency division multiplexed coherent systems using cascaded optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00184915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034352S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","articleId":"184915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":184917,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The performance of the amplifier as an optical gate is also shown as a function of the input optical signal levels, frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal driving signal, and the precise time delay between the input optical signal and the driving electrical signal.

A generic electronic circuit is proposed to compensate the distortions from all three mechanisms simultaneously.

These experimental results are not in accordance with theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/185053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4393686","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear second-order susceptibilities of asymmetric and electric-field-controlled multiple-quantum-well structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear second-order susceptibilities of asymmetric and electric-field-controlled multiple-quantum-well structures","sourcePdf":"00185053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035171S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"4743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"15","articleId":"185053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":185058,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Fiduccia-Mattheyses style ratio cut heuristics have achieved cost savings averaging over 39% for circuit partitioning and over 50% for hardware simulation applications. The authors show a theoretical correspondence between the optimal ratio cut partition cost and the second smallest eigenvalue of a particular netlist-derived matrix, and present fast Lanczos-based methods for computing heuristic ratio cuts from the eigenvector of this second eigenvalue. Results are better than those of previous methods, e.g. by an average of 17% for the Primary MCNC benchmarks. An efficient clustering method, also based on the second eigenvector, is very successful on the 'difficult' input classes in the CAD (computer-aided design) literature.

Computational results are presented for two examples: an interconnect circuit which contains lossless transmission lines and nonlinear components and a circuit consisting of two lossy coupled transmission lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/345/4745/00185193.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1991.185193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1991.185193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=185193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay and crosstalk simulation of high-speed VLSI interconnects with nonlinear terminations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Crosstalk","Very large scale integration","Integrated circuit interconnections","Propagation losses","Nonlinear equations","Transmission lines","Frequency domain analysis","Coupling circuits","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","crosstalk","differential equations","losses","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk simulation","nonlinear terminations","VLSI interconnects","lossy coupled transmission lines","nonlinear components","equivalent time domain macromodel","ordinary differential equations","asymptotic waveform evaluation","interconnect circuit","lossless transmission lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/185193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Delay and crosstalk simulation of high-speed VLSI interconnects with nonlinear terminations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4275208","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and crosstalk simulation of high-speed VLSI interconnects with nonlinear terminations","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00185193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036029S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"345","citationCount":"17","articleId":"185193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":185199,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the transformations is demonstrated using standard benchmark examples, with the aid of statistical analysis, and through a comparison with estimated minimal bounds.

It is based on the characterization of the feasible design space by worst-case points and related gradients. The expense for this characterization is linear with the number of circuit performances.

The entire optimization process with regard to performance, yield, and robustness uses sensitivity analyses and requires a much smaller number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo-based approaches. Moreover, the proposed method takes into account the partitioning of the parameter space into deterministic and statistical parameters which is an inherent property of integrated circuit design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1991.185221","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/345/4745/00185221.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1991.185221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit optimization driven by worst-case distances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=185221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/185221/","displayDocTitle":"Circuit optimization driven by worst-case distances","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4275230","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit optimization driven by worst-case distances","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00185221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044121S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"345","citationCount":"13","articleId":"185221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":185244,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

Given a set of nodes to be minimized, one first calculates sets of supports which are necessary to construct the functions for the given nodes by applying functional reduction. The functional reduction process guarantees that one can get the minimal support for each node. One then makes a covering table for the set of nodes to be minimized so that one can get the minimal supports to cover all the functions for the given set of nodes to be minimized. The authors present a preliminary implementation and its results for ISCAS combinational benchmark circuits combined with MIS2.1 standard script and a Boolean resubstitution minimizer, and show the effectiveness of the presented method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/185332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281088","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-level logic minimization based on minimal support and its application to the minimization of look-up table type FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level logic minimization based on minimal support and its application to the minimization of look-up table type FPGAs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00185332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037736S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"345","citationCount":"17","articleId":"185332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":185333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The key feature of the algorithm is the use of bin packing to determine the gate-level decomposition of every node in the network.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the values of the completed tasks. An online scheduling algorithm that achieves optimal performance when the system is underloaded and provides a nontrivial performance guarantee when the system is overloaded is designed. The algorithm is implemented using simple data structures to run at a cost of O(log n) time per task, where n bounds the number of tasks in the system at any instant.

The algorithms are novel in that they are based on data compression techniques that are both theoretically optimal and good in practice. Intuitively, in order to compress data effectively, one has to be able to predict feature data well, and thus good data compressors should be able to predict well for purposes of prefetching.

Low DC power consumption, a low noise figure, and high gain make this device well suited for front-end receiver applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/185987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4292261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 2.5 dB low noise 6 to 18 GHz HEMT MMIC amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.5 dB low noise 6 to 18 GHz HEMT MMIC amplifier","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00185987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045593S","chronDate":"1-3 June 1992","isNumber":"4752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"658","citationCount":"3","articleId":"185987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":185989,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For noise modeling of the MODFETs up to millimeter-wave frequencies, a novel approach based on the temperature-noise model reported by M.W. Pospiezalski (1989) was used.

The entire receiver was packaged on the planar back surface of a 1.5-in.-diameter lens. This lens, hyperhemispherical in shape, provided a dual function as a focusing lens and carrier for the monolithic receiver. The measured noise figure and conversion gain of the receiver were 8.7 dB and 19.0 dB, respectively, at 35.0 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1992 Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium Digest of Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/658/4752/00186010.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1992 Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium Digest of Papers","doi":"10.1109/MCS.1992.186010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.1992.186010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-wave slot ring mixer array receiver technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave technology","Lenses","Millimeter wave radar","Receiving antennas","Radar antennas","Gallium arsenide","Packaging","Shape","Gain measurement","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixers (circuits)","MMIC","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MM-wave slot ring mixer array receiver technology","quasi-optical MM-wave monolithic monopulse receiver","antenna integration","hyperhemispherical lens","quasi-optical diplexer","radar front end","monolithic chips","focusing lens","noise figure","conversion gain","8.7 dB","19 dB","35 GHz","GaAs substrates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 1992","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave slot ring mixer array receiver technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4292280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave slot ring mixer array receiver technology","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00186010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035511S","chronDate":"1-3 June 1992","isNumber":"4752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"658","citationCount":"12","articleId":"186010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186015,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

A class of systems which can be globally controlled by adaptive observer-based output-feedback compensators is identified by geometric coordinate-free conditions. The nonlinearities depend on the output only: growth conditions are not required. Each system in the class admits observers with linear error dynamics and is minimum phase, i.e., it has linear asymptotically stable zero dynamics. When the parameters are known, new sufficient conditions for global output-feedback tracking control are obtained as a special case. For linear systems the result recovers a well-known fundamental adaptive result.

The fundamental operating principles, such as high-frequency traveling waves, a self-stabilizing temperature gradient, and increased wave number, are outlined. The main advantages of the realized pump are its ability to move conductive liquids such as water and weak electrolyte solutions, the lack of any movable parts, and integration. A microfabricated structure demonstrating the pump operation is outlined, and quantitative results are described. Typical parameters characterizing the advantages and limitations of the pumping principle are discussed. Perspectives for optimization of the realized micropump can be seen in further miniaturization and increased number of electrodes. Possible applications are biological, medical, and chemical devices that can deliver accurately metered quantities of fluids in the nl/min and mu l/min range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/84.186393","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","startPage":"141","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/4761/00186393.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.186393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microfabricated electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps for liquids of higher conductivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrohydrodynamics","Liquids","Conductivity","Pumps","Micropumps","Temperature","Chemicals","Biomedical electrodes","Microactuators","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrohydrodynamics","micromechanical devices","pumps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological devices","medical devices","traveling-wave-driven electrohydrodynamic micropump","self-stabilizing temperature gradient","wave number","conductive liquids","weak electrolyte solutions","microfabricated structure","chemical devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Microfabricated electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps for liquids of higher conductivity","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4376269","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186393/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microfabricated electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps for liquids of higher conductivity","sourcePdf":"00186393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070284S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"107","articleId":"186393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":186408,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors use the ideas presented by L.C.

The target 1+0.25D-0.75D/sup 2/-0.5D/sup 3/ is shown to outperform the EPR4 target over a large range of densities. It is shown that in the absence of coding there exists little opportunity for performance improvements beyond those found with this target.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New equalizer targets for sampled magnetic recording systems","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186408","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186408.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"34 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"New equalizer targets for sampled magnetic recording systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4275934","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New equalizer targets for sampled magnetic recording systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096053S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"7","articleId":"186408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186418,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed design uses 2p+1 PEs and external memory of size O(N) to compute 2N+1 Fourier coefficients, 1<or=p<or=N. Each PE has an adder and a fixed amount of local storage and one PE has a multiplier. Input/output (I/O) with the host is performed using a fixed number of channels. By suitable choice of the I/O schedule and activation of PEs, nonuniform data dependencies in the AFT computation, which require nonequidistant inputs and assignment of Mobius function values are resolved. The design achieves linear speedup and can also be used to compute the discrete cosine transform.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186419","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186419.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"89 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed size array architectures for computing arithmetic Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186419/","displayDocTitle":"Fixed size array architectures for computing arithmetic Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4275945","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed size array architectures for computing arithmetic Fourier transform","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045268S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"2","articleId":"186419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186423,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

By replacing the time-domain multiplicative window preprocessing with polyphase filter processing, much of the processing loss of windowed FFTs can be eliminated. Polyphase coefficient memory costs are minimized by effective use of run-length compression. Finite word length effects are analyzed, producing a balanced system with 8 bit inputs, 16 bit fixed-point polyphase arithmetic and 24 bit fixed-point FFT arithmetic. Fixed-point renormalization midway through the computation is seen to be naturally accommodated by the matrix FFT algorithm proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4275949","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 640 MHz 32 megachannel real-time polyphase-FFT spectrum analyzer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 640 MHz 32 megachannel real-time polyphase-FFT spectrum analyzer","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058636S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"11","articleId":"186423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":186426,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

The effects of acoustic headshadow are incorporated in a simulated array processor. Room reverberation effects are also modeled.

The reduction in computation translates into an overall decrease in chip area required for a VLSI layout of the filter. As an example in a representative VLSI technology, a pipelined design yields a 30% decrease in chip area per tap and a 20% decrease in overall chip area compared to a modified Booth's multiplier implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186480.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"402 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-efficient VLSI implementation of FIR digital filters using shifted partial products","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Costs","Signal processing algorithms","Computational efficiency","Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis","Area measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","CMOS integrated circuits","digital filters","digital signal processing chips","pipeline processing","vectors","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-efficient VLSI implementation","signal processing algorithms","CMOS","CAD VLSI layout","FIR digital filters","shifted partial products","scalar-vector products","vector elements","transpose form","pipelined design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Area-efficient VLSI implementation of FIR digital filters using shifted partial products","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4276006","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-efficient VLSI implementation of FIR digital filters using shifted partial products","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033577S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"3","articleId":"186480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":186499,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Two types of source transmissions are considered: (1) single signal transmission and (2) dual signal transmission. The model is given in terms of several parameters including the wave direction of arrival and state of polarization. A compact expression is derived for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation errors of these parameters for the multi-source multi-vector sensor model. The advantage of using vector sensors is highlighted by explicit evaluation of the CRB and the associated mean-square angular error for source localization with a single vector sensor. A simple algorithm is proposed for estimating the source DOA with this sensor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector sensor processing for electromagnetic source localization","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186512","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186512.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"572 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Vector sensor processing for electromagnetic source localization","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4276038","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector sensor processing for electromagnetic source localization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038275S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"24","articleId":"186512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":186514,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

In contrast to other derivative constraint methods which constrain both the magnitude and phase responses of the beamformer, the method only constrains the magnitude response. The constraint on the phase is shown to be the reason that the conventional magnitude-phase derivative constraint methods are sensitive to the location of the spatial reference point used to define the array element positions. This problem, which is a major drawback of the conventional methods, is eliminated in the new approach.

It is shown that a parallel bank of Kalman filters can be used to update a suboptimum Bayesian formula for the sequence possibilities. Two methods are used to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. First, it is shown that the Kalman filters can be replaced by simpler least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters. Second, the technique of reduced-state sequence estimation is adopted to reduce the number of symbol subsequences considered in the Bayesian updating, and hence the number of parallel filters required. The performance properties of the resulting algorithms are evaluated through bit error simulations, and these are compared to the bounds of optimum maximum-likelihood sequence estimation. It is shown that the Kalman filter and LMS-based algorithms achieve blind start-up and rapid convergence (within 200 iterations) for both binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation formats.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186540","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","startPage":"710","endPage":"715 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186540/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281924","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066381S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"12","articleId":"186540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186543,"authors":[{"name":"F.

COMA exhibits desired properties from the constant modulus algorithm and decision directed algorithm, such as an invariance to carrier modulation, probability distribution of constellation points, and correlation between symbols. COMA's nonlinear error generation precludes the use of classical closed-form analysis to insure an optimal weighting function design. Nevertheless, a simplified weighting function design algorithm is presented, which can be extended to high-order modulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186543.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"730 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive blind equalization algorithm for QAM and QPR modulations: The concentric ordered modulus algorithm, with results for 16 QAM and 9 QPR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Blind equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Convergence","Uncertainty","Nearest neighbor searches","Differential equations","Error correction","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","equalisers","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbols correlation","16 QAM","9 QPR","adaptive blind equalization algorithm","concentric ordered modulus algorithm","COMA","quadrature amplitude modulation","weighted minimum difference","signal sample","carrier modulation","probability distribution","constellation points","nonlinear error generation","closed-form analysis","optimal weighting function design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive blind equalization algorithm for QAM and QPR modulations: The concentric ordered modulus algorithm, with results for 16 QAM and 9 QPR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive blind equalization algorithm for QAM and QPR modulations: The concentric ordered modulus algorithm, with results for 16 QAM and 9 QPR","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037029S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"5","articleId":"186543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186551,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

On the other hand, a high bit rate system which uses a spreading code with 2/sup 11/ chips can support up to 75 users if the maximum allowed possibility of bit error is 10/sup -6/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186572","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186572.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"882 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error probabilities of coherent optical heterodyne FSK-CDMA signals in a noncoherent detection system degraded by laser phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186572/","displayDocTitle":"Error probabilities of coherent optical heterodyne FSK-CDMA signals in a noncoherent detection system degraded by laser phase noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281956","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probabilities of coherent optical heterodyne FSK-CDMA signals in a noncoherent detection system degraded by laser phase noise","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032368S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"2","articleId":"186572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":186578,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It only requires O(NMd) flops for a N*M data matrix and achieves almost an order of magnitude computational reduction over the O(NM/sup 2/+M/sup 3/) SVD (singular value decomposition) or ED (eigendecomposition) approach. A novel detection scheme is also presented that can be implemented at each intermediate step of estimating the signal subspace. Unlike many fast algorithms that trade performance for speed, rigorous performance analysis shows that Bi-FSD has the same asymptotic performance as the more costly SVD, and the Bi-FSD detection scheme is strongly consistent. Also, the most computationally intensive part (i.e., O(NM) operations) is O(d) matrix-vector products, which can be easily implemented in parallel for even faster computation. All these features of the Bi-FSD algorithm make it easier to implement a class of high-resolution array signal processing algorithms in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186578","publicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Conference Record of the Twenty-Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/382/4762/00186578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1991.186578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762","startPage":"908","endPage":"912 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast subspace decomposition of data matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=186578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast subspace decomposition of data matrices","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186578/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281962","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast subspace decomposition of data matrices","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036846S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"10","articleId":"186578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":186590,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The stochastic segment model (SSM) is a joint model for a sequence of observations which provides explicit modeling of time correlation as well as a formalism for incorporating segmental features. The authors examine the modeling of time correlation within a segment. They consider three Gaussian model variations based on different assumptions about the form of statistical dependency, including a Gauss-Markov model, a dynamical system model, and a target state model, all of which can be formulated in terms of the dynamical system model. Evaluation of the different modeling assumptions is in terms of both phoneme classification performance and the predictive power of linear models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/186590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4281974","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The stochastic segment model for continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The stochastic segment model for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00186590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032758S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"382","citationCount":"3","articleId":"186590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":186595,"authors":[{"name":"W.P.

This principle allows the use of fixed sparsed arrays, operating at metric wavelengths, thus providing an excellent Doppler separation, through long term integration. Advantage can then also be taken from stable, irreducible RCS of targets, as well as low cost transmitting power. The authors give an overview of the experimental trials conducted between 1988 and 1991 and the demonstrating system, in order to evaluate the performance of its surveillance mode on various points of view. Among them, three aspects have been thoroughly investigated, namely: radar coverage and radiation pattern analysis, accuracy in 4D localization, and 4D discrimination between targets. They present a description of the experimental system, of the way in which it has been operated, and of the kind of data which has been recorded during test flights.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"92 International Conference on Radar","pdfPath":"/iel3/1189/4767/00187047.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"92 International Conference on Radar","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=187047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental results on RIAS digital beamforming radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Calibration","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","calibration","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RIAS digital beamforming radar","Synthetic Antenna and Impulse Radar","transmit array","delivering sampled","processing equipment","Doppler filtering","time-space beamforming","target extraction","sparsed arrays","excellent Doppler separation","low cost transmitting power","radar coverage","radiation pattern analysis","4D localization","4D discrimination between targets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Experimental results on RIAS digital beamforming radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4310923","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental results on RIAS digital beamforming radar","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00187047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04292S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct 1992","isNumber":"4767","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1189","citationCount":"4","articleId":"187047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":187097,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

A possibility is to attempt to make use of 'illuminators of opportunity', i.e. transmissions present for other purposes and with favourable location, power level and modulation. The objective of the work described is to extend the idea to the use of satellite-borne illuminators of opportunity, and to explore their use for various types of surveillance application. For the purposes of this work, direct broadcast by satellite television (DBS TV) transmissions are employed, though this does not necessarily rule out other forms of satellite-borne transmissions.

A central strategy is the use of the medium voltage (11 kV) distribution networks as well as the low voltage (240/415 V) distribution networks for communication. The traditional penalty of this approach, that of very low data rates due to the low carrier frequencies necessary for signals to pass through distribution transformers, is avoided by the use of a low-cost bypass device to couple signals around transformers. In this way, relatively high carrier frequencies can be employed leading to data rates of around 10000 baud throughout the distribution network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4310965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 1992","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Remote meter reading and control using high-performance PLC communications over the low voltage and medium voltage distribution networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote meter reading and control using high-performance PLC communications over the low voltage and medium voltage distribution networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00187316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022957S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov 1992","isNumber":"4769","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1187","citationCount":"4","articleId":"187316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":187334,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Generalized impedance control (GIC) is presented as a method of intelligent position and force control of manipulators dynamically interacting with an uncertain environment. The GIC is achieved by representing the desirable behavior of a manipulator end-effector as a general dynamic relationship between a motion error and a contact force error, referred to as generalized impedance. The approach differs from previous manipulator control approaches in that it neither assumes the orthogonality between force and position control nor requires the switching of control for the transition between free and constrained motions. Furthermore, it is robust to the environmental stiffness ranging from zero stiffness (free space) to high stiffness (rigid contact).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187334/","accessionNumber":"4233988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent control of manipulators interacting with an uncertain environment based on generalized impedance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent control of manipulators interacting with an uncertain environment based on generalized impedance","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00187334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023272S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug 1991","isNumber":"4770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"571","citationCount":"31","articleId":"187334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":187350,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A neural network compensation scheme assumes no a priori knowledge as to the structure of the nonlinearity and, with suitable computational capability and sufficient training and data, allows 'inversion' of the undesirable nonlinear effects. Since the network is learning both a structure as well as parameter values, the computational load is high. A further problem is the lack of stability guarantees for the weight update procedure and the distinct possibility of the network converging to local minima in the error backpropagation algorithm, although these phenomena did not appear to be problematic in experiment. A Lyapunov-based strategy offers fast parameter estimation with vastly reduced computation loads and hence the capability of adapting to varying surface friction conditions in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1991.187394","pdfPath":"/iel2/571/4770/00187394.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"422","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1991.187394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent model reference nonlinear friction compensation using neural networks and Lyapunov based adaptive control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent model reference nonlinear friction compensation using neural networks and Lyapunov based adaptive control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4234031","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent model reference nonlinear friction compensation using neural networks and Lyapunov based adaptive control","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00187394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028567S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug 1991","isNumber":"4770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"571","citationCount":"7","articleId":"187394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":187513,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

For the flash concepts that are utilizing channel hot electron injection for the programming, a new disturbance mechanism caused by substrate injection of thermally generated electrons is reported. This mechanism disturbs an erased call during programming cycles of other bits along the same bitline. The high-temperature programming requirement for flash EPROMs drastically enhances the disturbance through the strong increase in thermally generated electrons in the substrate. This program disturbance has the greatest impact on the wordline oriented sector erase memory architectures, through the increase in disturbance time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"30th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1992","displayPublicationTitle":"30th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1992","pdfPath":"/iel2/612/4772/00187625.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Substrate injection induced program disturb-a new reliability consideration for flash-EPROM arrays","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1992.187625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1992.187625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=187625","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 1992-April 2 1992","displayDocTitle":"Substrate injection induced program disturb-a new reliability consideration for flash-EPROM arrays","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4291940","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Substrate injection induced program disturb-a new reliability consideration for flash-EPROM arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00187625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022052S","chronDate":"March 31 1992-April 2 1992","isNumber":"4772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"612","citationCount":"10","articleId":"187625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":187626,"authors":[{"name":"S.Z.

The purpose was to clarify the mechanism of this relaxation. During low-frequency (DC to mHz) pulse-migration tests, an extremely slow relaxation was detected in Al conductor resistances after pulse-on and pulse-off. Conductor lifetime dependence on the pulse frequency revealed that this relaxation phenomenon corresponds to the recovery of migration damage. The very slow rate of the relaxation suggests that the resistance changes are caused by processes such as long-distance grain boundary diffusion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 1992-April 2 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187647/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4291962","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relaxation phenomenon during electromigration under pulsed current","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxation phenomenon during electromigration under pulsed current","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00187647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032077S","chronDate":"March 31 1992-April 2 1992","isNumber":"4772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"612","citationCount":"1","articleId":"187647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":187657,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In addition, they have identified a new source of alpha particles that contributes to the soft error rate of memory ICs, namely, the phosphoric acid used during wafer fabrication.

In contrast to the conventional FD-TD eigenvalue formulation, which requires a three-dimensional mesh for adequately formed resonator sections, this method utilizes advantageously a two-dimensional mesh for analyzing the full-wave dispersive characteristic of guided structures. This leads to a significant reduction in CPU time and storage requirements. Numerical examples are presented for bi- and unilateral finlines with finite metallization thickness and for a pair of coupled shielded dielectric guides. The theory is verified by comparison with results obtained by other methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1992.187994","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE MTT-S Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE MTT-S Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/646/4776/00187994.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1992.187994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved FD-TD full wave analysis for arbitrary guiding structures using a two-dimensional mesh","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=187994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/187994/","displayDocTitle":"An improved FD-TD full wave analysis for arbitrary guiding structures using a two-dimensional mesh","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4291780","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved FD-TD full wave analysis for arbitrary guiding structures using a two-dimensional mesh","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00187994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029358S","chronDate":"1-5 June 1992","isNumber":"4776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"646","citationCount":"20","articleId":"187994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":187997,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

This technique can be extended to n-port networks and works equally well with circuit models or S-parameter descriptions. Most importantly, it can detect special cases of instability involving active terminations.

A differential equation approach was developed.

Examples of state-of-the-art receivers at frequencies from L- to Q-band are discussed. A model-based prediction of future performance demonstrates that HFET receivers should soon be competitive with SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) mixer receivers at W-band frequencies. It is noted that the trade-off in low-noise amplifier design (bandwidth, input voltage standing wave ratio, stability, gain) can be reliably investigated in a computer model leading to a design with an optimal noise bandwidth performance. The bandwidth of a receiver is no longer limited by the amplifier bandwidth. In many receiving systems, the noise of a HFET amplifier is no longer a dominant contribution to the system noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1992.188260","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE MTT-S Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1372 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1992.188260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776","pdfPath":"/iel2/646/4776/00188260.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE MTT-S Microwave Symposium Digest","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","MODFETs","Receivers","Superconducting device noise","Bandwidth","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Frequency","Radio astronomy","Predictive models","Superconducting devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","microwave amplifiers","radioastronomy","solid-state microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L-band","HFET amplifiers","cryogenically coolable","heterostructure field-effect transistor","receivers","radio astronomy applications","Q-band","model-based prediction","W-band","low-noise amplifier design","computer model","noise bandwidth performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenically-cooled, HFET amplifiers and receivers: state-of-the-art and future trends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/188260/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4296979","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenically-cooled, HFET amplifiers and receivers: state-of-the-art and future trends","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00188260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052673S","chronDate":"1-5 June 1992","isNumber":"4776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"646","citationCount":"31","articleId":"188260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":188279,"authors":[{"name":"F. van Raay","affiliation":["Department of High Frequency Engineering, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"F.","lastName":"van Raay","id":"37300890400"},{"name":"G.

The model is based on the physical and mathematical properties of the driving point admittance of passive, stable one-port networks. The model parameters, which depend on the geometry of the waveguide and aperture, are determined from a relatively small number of computed admittances. These computed data are obtained by a full-wave moment method solution and, hence, include the effects of radiation and energy storage in the near-field and the evanescent waveguide modes. The accuracy of the model, for both the direct and the inverse problem, is verified.

The front end of the scheme is a derivation of Kohonen's self-organization model to configure maps for the satellite communication network dynamically. The model consists of three stages. The first stage is the pattern recognition task, in which an exemplar map that best meets the current network requirements is selected. The second stage is the analysis of the discrepancy between the chosen exemplar map and the state of the network, and the adaptive modification of the chosen exemplar map to conform closely to the network requirement (input data pattern) by means of Kohonen's self-organization. On the basis of certain performance criteria, whether a new map is generated to replace the original chosen map is decided in the third stage. A state-dependent routing algorithm, which arranges the incoming call to some proper path, is used to make the network more efficient and to lower the call block rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1991.188366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM '91: Countdown to the New Millennium.

For this purpose an efficient neural network shortest path algorithm based on the Hopfield model is proposed, which is an improved version of previously suggested neural algorithms. The general principles involved in the design of the proposed neural network are discussed. The computational power of the proposed neural model is demonstrated through computer simulations.

An attempt is made to show how to apply neural network optimization techniques to solve the resulting linear programming problem in real time. For this purpose an extended version of the linear programming network proposed by L.O. Chua and G.N. Lin (1984, 1985) is suggested. The computational power of the extended model is demonstrated through computer simulations. The neural network hardware approach has the potential for a high computational speed due to the massive parallelism in computations that takes place at each processing element.

As a form of preplanning, whenever the topology of the network is deliberately changed, new optimal rerouting plans are calculated, using a centralized or a distributed approach, for each possible total cable failure. These plans are used to calculate distance labels that are stored in the digital cross-connect systems or other switching elements. When a failure occurs, the nodes (switches) at either end of the failed cable start the execution of a distributed max-flow algorithm and communicate with their neighbors by message passing. As nodes become involved in the execution of the distributed algorithm, they imitate their state using the precalculated distance labels. An appropriate set of distance labels can be defined on a transformed version of the network such that, if no topology changes have occurred in the network since the labels were calculated, the algorithm immediately converges to the optimal solution. If, on the other hand, links and/or nodes have been removed since the labels were calculated, the algorithm will still function properly and converge to a solution that has the maximal number of restored circuits (although the restoration paths are not necessarily of shortest possible length).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1991.188403","pdfPath":"/iel2/536/4777/00188403.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM '91: Countdown to the New Millennium.

Minimum cost and complexity have been driving design issues and are achieved by fully digital signal processing.

It has been found that the acquisition concept can accommodate large frequency errors and that dramatic improvements can be obtained by slightly increasing E/sub I//N/sub 0/.

The CDMA system functioned with excellent voice quality at mobile power levels of 100 mu W or less, and the microwave signals caused no significant effect on performance.

These values are higher than previously published optical systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM '91: Countdown to the New Millennium.

With the use of a control channel, each station in the network can obtain packet backlog information of all the other stations, and so packet transmission can be scheduled to avoid destination conflicts. A very fast scheduling algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that a maximum throughput of 1 can be achieved, as compared to a maximum of 0.63 for protocols without transmission scheduling. This high throughput performance is obtained because the transmission, reception and processing of backlog information and the transmission and reception of data packets are all done simultaneously in a pipeline operation and all destination conflicts are avoided in every slot through scheduling. The packet delay is calculated to be only one slot (due to scheduling) larger than those protocols without transmission scheduling at low traffic conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/188575/","accessionNumber":"4291308","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A conflict-free protocol for optical WDMA networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A conflict-free protocol for optical WDMA networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00188575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030396S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1991","isNumber":"4777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"536","citationCount":"51","articleId":"188575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":188576,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.J.

Attenuation was very nearly the same at the four frequencies, within the limits of the experiment's accuracy. The variation of the received signal level with distance could be characterized by free space propagation together with attenuation per unit distance. This attenuation coefficient was about the same at the four frequencies.

Results from dual-frequency measurements performed in urban areas at 955 MHz and 1845 MHz are presented. The mean difference in path loss between the two frequencies was found to be 10 dB, whereas the free-space loss is only 6 dB. The shadow-fading at the two frequencies was highly correlated. Therefore much of the experience from the 900-MHz band can be used for planning of new cellular systems in the 1800-2000-MHz band. M. Hata's (1980) prediction model was fitted to the data at both frequencies, but predicted too-low path loss at 1845 MHz. A modified Hata prediction model is proposed for use in the frequency range 1500 to 2000 MHz.

The bit error rate (BER) is determined in terms of the RMS of the error vector magnitude in the presence of ISI and modulator nonlinearity and imbalance. The current standards allow a maximum RMS of 0.125. The BER with RMS=0.125 is obtained for different modulator impairments. It is shown that the BER is a function of the RMS of the error vector magnitude and the type of modulator nonlinearity involved. An adaptive amplitude and phase adjustment technique to compensate for the above system impairments is introduced.

In the first implementation of a high-capacity transmission, the authors present the prospect of fiber-optic transmission of microwave 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals at 10-Mb/s and 50-Mb/s transmission rates. Bit error rate (BER) performance results are shown as a function of received optical power and optical modulation index. It is shown that the results of theoretical BER performance calculations are in agreement with that of preliminary experiments for two types of 256-QAM signals. Error correction coding using a BCH code is very effective in improving the system performance. Finally, the choice of the total optical modulation index for multichannel transmission is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM '91: Countdown to the New Millennium.
