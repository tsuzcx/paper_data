This pattern can be developed by providing consumers with information obtained from non-invasive load monitoring. Improvement electric energy management can be achieved by turning off unnecessary appliances and by shifting some of them to off-peak hours. A rational benefit for consumers is the reduction of electricity consumption costs. In this paper, energy disaggregation was abandoned by introducing virtual electrical devices and by using optimal selection of explanatory data obtained from high-frequency measurements. The concept of virtuality results from the simultaneous operation of many physical devices, and especially for which it is difficult to distinguish the state of load, e.g., small, medium or large. The explanatory data was selected using the integral information capacity indicator of individual features. The determination of this indicator is based on the correlations between the explanatory variables, the explained variable and the mutual correlations between the explanatory variables. The parameters selected in this way constitute input data for various artificial neural network architectures identifying the electrical appliances. The obtained research results are very promising and confirm the validity of the approach used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9650616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9650616/","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Electrical Appliances Using Their Virtual Description and Data Selection for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Electrical Appliances Using Their Virtual Description and Data Selection for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tce-bartman-3135423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056372S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9650616","onlineDate":"14 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9650849,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Darabi","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9650849/darab-3135758-small.gif","p":["Mostafa Darabi (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the K.

Jointly deriving the four matrices of analog precoder, digital precoder, analog combiner, and digital combiner for mmWave FD communications is intractable. Hence, we propose two approaches for either designing joint analog and digital beamformers separately at the transmitters and receivers, or jointly deriving transmit precoders and receive combiners with separate designs of analog and digital beamforming matrices that maximize the sum-rate. In the first proposed method, at the first step, we derive an iterative solution for the fully digital minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) transmit/receive beamforming. Then, exploiting the spatial structure of mmWave channels, sparse approximation problems are formulated to jointly design radio frequency (RF) and baseband filters approximating the fully digital beamformers via orthogonal-matching-pursuit (OMP) algorithm. To reduce the computational complexity of the first proposed method, which is mainly caused by the iterations between the transmit and receive beamformings, in the second presented scheme, transmit precoding and receive combining matrices are calculated jointly, while RF and digital beamformings are derived separately. More specifically, digital beamforming matrices are derived using the block diagonalization (BD) approach to mitigate the intra-user and inter-users interference, and analog filters are calculated via solving sum-rate maximization problem. In the simulation results, it is shown that our proposed OMP-based hybrid beamforming (HBF) scheme outperforms other HBF approaches for mmWave FD communications in the literature. In addition, it is shown that when the number of RF chains is at least double the number of data streams, the proposed BD-based HBF further improves over the OMP-based HBF in terms of sum-rate. Thus, choosing between OMP-based and BD-based HBF depends on the number of available RF chains.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135758","startPage":"165394","endPage":"165408","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09650849.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Design in Millimeter Wave Full-Duplex Multi-User Massive MIMO Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Design in Millimeter Wave Full-Duplex Multi-User Massive MIMO Communication Systems","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9650849/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9650849/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Transceiver Design in Millimeter Wave Full-Duplex Multi-User Massive MIMO Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"access-darabi-3135758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099222S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9650849","onlineDate":"14 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9651259,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Heinz","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Heinz","id":"37087882053"},{"name":"Andreas Koch","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Koch","id":"37274057500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4664-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3071-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9651259","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Data FPGA-Accelerated Processing of Collective and Inference Operations in Disaggregated Memory Systems","abstract":"With growing data set sizes, many scientific and data center HPC workloads observe an increasing scaling imbalance, e.g., between compute and memory capacities. As a solution, disaggregated system architectures employ spatial distribution of the different resources. They aim for independent scaling of the different resource kinds (e.g., compute, non-volatile storage, memory), and use fast communication fabrics for their interconnection.However, for some bulk operations, such as reductions and collections, it is still beneficial to perform them close to the memories, avoiding the need to move large volumes of data over the fabric.This work realizes a disaggregated system capable of performing such near-data processing (NDP) operations by extending the distributed memory controllers with hardware-accelerated compute capabilities. The actual computations execute on FPGAs and can be abstractly described using C/C++ as compilable by high-level hardware synthesis (HLS) tools.We have aimed for high usability of our technology also by HPC experts unfamiliar with hardware design. An automated toolflow encapsulates the creation and deployment of the actual accelerators in the disaggregated system. The NDP operations execute distributed across all memory nodes, and are easily accessed using a simple MPI-based programming interface that requires only minimal effort to use in existing applications.Our solution is demonstrated using a prototype disaggregated system based on the low-latency EXTOLL fabric for communication. We evaluate both conventional reductions/collectives as well as complete machine-learning inference tasks.","doi":"10.1109/H2RC54759.2021.00010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/H2RC54759.2021.00010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9651235","startPage":"44","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Heterogeneous High-performance Reconfigurable Computing (H2RC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9651232/9651235/09651259.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Heterogeneous High-performance Reconfigurable Computing (H2RC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9651259","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Memory management","Systems architecture","Prototypes","Process control","Programming","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["n/a"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Near-Data FPGA-Accelerated Processing of Collective and Inference Operations in Disaggregated Memory Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9651259/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9651259/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Data FPGA-Accelerated Processing of Collective and Inference Operations in Disaggregated Memory Systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"466400a044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058232S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9651232","isNumber":"9651235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9651232","xplore-issue":"9651235","articleId":"9651259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9651265,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhao He","affiliation":["Systems Group, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Zhenhao","lastName":"He","id":"37086557208"},{"name":"Daniele Parravicini","affiliation":["Research Labs, Xilinx, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Parravicini","id":"37089199822"},{"name":"Lucian Petrica","affiliation":["Research Labs, Xilinx, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Petrica","id":"37072667400"},{"name":"Kenneth O\u2019Brien","affiliation":["Research Labs, Xilinx, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"O\u2019Brien","id":"37086045013"},{"name":"Gustavo Alonso","affiliation":["Systems Group, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Alonso","id":"37279222700"},{"name":"Michaela Blott","affiliation":["Research Labs, Xilinx, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Blott","id":"38479349300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4664-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3071-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9651265","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","TCPIP","Libraries","Field programmable gate arrays","Optimization","Open source software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","collectives","MPI"]}],"abstract":"Collective operations such as scatter, gather, reduce, etc are utilized broadly to implement distributed HPC applications and are the target of extensive optimization in all MPI implementations as well as dedicated collective libraries by accelerator vendors (e.g. NCCL and RCCL by NVidia and AMD respectively).

Up to now, many studies have applied Deep Learning (DL) to polyp detection and have obtained promising results, but all the algorithms are run on GPUs. They cannot be transferred to the fast-growing segment of mobile medical devices which require low power uptake. To bridge this gap, we designed a polyp detection algorithm for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We present the detailed procedure of Deep Neural Network (DNN) design and the FPGA implementation and show that the FPGA-based polyp detection outperforms the GPU-based one in terms of energy efficiency and lower latency.

Road crack detection is generally performed by either certified inspectors or structural engineers. Nevertheless, this process is time-consuming and subjective. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated compelling results for image classification, but there are currently no comprehensive comparisons among them, in regard to road crack detection. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to compare 30 state-of-the-art (SoTA) DCNNs for road crack detection: Each DCNN is trained on a training set; The best performing models are selected on the validation set; Their performance is further quantified on a test set with respect to six evaluation metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, F-score, area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and runtime. The experimental results suggest that road crack detection is a relatively easy image classification task. All the SoTA DCNNs perform similarly. The DCNNs evaluated in this study also achieved very similar performance when only a small amount of training data is available. Furthermore, PNASNet achieved the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, and thus, it is more practical to be used for real-time and robust road crack detection. Moreover, it was found that the best DCNN models did not generalize well when tested on new unseen data sets consisting of images not specifically related to road cracks.","doi":"10.1109/IST50367.2021.9651375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST50367.2021.9651375","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9651277/9651324/09651375.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9651324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Road Crack Detection: Qualitative and Quantitative Comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Road Crack Detection: Qualitative and Quantitative Comparisons","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"24 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9651375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9651375/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Road Crack Detection: Qualitative and Quantitative Comparisons","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1570722354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085054S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9651277","isNumber":"9651324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9651277","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9651324","articleId":"9651375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9651842,"authors":[{"name":"Ricko","affiliation":["Diponegoro University, Semarang, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Ricko","id":"37088596842"},{"name":"Priyo Sidik Sasongko","affiliation":["Diponegoro University, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Priyo Sidik","lastName":"Sasongko","id":"37086283665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3807-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3808-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2767-7087"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2767-7079"}],"articleNumber":"9651842","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"abstract":"Twitter was a social media for interacting with friends, conveying thoughts, feelings, ideas, or just a medium for seeking entertainment or information.

The primary transmitter communicates with the IR and at the same time assists the IRS in forwarding information to the IR. Based on the IRS\u2019s symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3135603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09652042.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3135603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Wireless Communication Paradigm for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Based Symbiotic Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Wireless Communication Paradigm for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Based Symbiotic Radio Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9652042/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006469","fundingName":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci\u00eancias e da Tecnologia","grantNumber":"0119/2020/A3, 0108/2020/A and SKL-IOTSC(UM)-2021-2023"},{"fundingName":"GDST","grantNumber":"2021A1515011900 and 2020B1212030003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015013","fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2021D15"},{"fundingName":"Meng Hua","grantNumber":"UMMTP-2020-02"},{"fundingName":"DFG","grantNumber":"SCHO 831/15-1 and 454492702"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Wireless Communication Paradigm for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Based Symbiotic Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-3135603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135931S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9652042","onlineDate":"15 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9652071,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9652071/liu-3135692-small.gif","p":["Fan Liu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.

We employ the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance metric of target estimation, under both point and extended target scenarios. We then propose minimizing the CRB of radar sensing while guaranteeing a pre-defined level of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each communication user. For the single-user scenario, we derive a closed form for the optimal solution for both cases of point and extended targets. For the multi-user scenario, we show that both problems can be relaxed into semidefinite programming by using the semidefinite relaxation approach, and prove that the global optimum can be generally obtained. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the globally optimal solutions are reachable via the proposed methods, which provide significant gains in target estimation performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Array signal processing","Sensors","Radar antennas","Estimation","Optimization","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-functional radar-communication","joint beamforming","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","semidefinite relaxation","successive convex approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3135692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09652071.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3135692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Optimization for Joint Radar-Communication Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Optimization for Joint Radar-Communication Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652071/","volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9652071/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101234, 62101422 and 12022116"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/S028455/1"},{"fundingName":"China Academy of Information and Communications Technology","grantNumber":"CG20210717002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Optimization for Joint Radar-Communication Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-3135692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123454S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9652071","onlineDate":"15 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":9652112,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio E.

The empirical log-likelihood statistic is adopted to approximate the sufficient statistics of an oracle test against independence (that knows the two hypotheses). It is shown that approximating the sufficient statistics of the oracle test offers a learning criterion for designing a data-driven partition that connects with the problem of mutual information estimation. Applying these ideas in the context of a data-dependent tree-structured partition (TSP), we derive conditions on the TSP\u2019s parameters to achieve a strongly consistent distribution-free test of independence over the family of probabilities equipped with a density. Complementing this result, we present finite-length results that show our TSP scheme\u2019s capacity to detect the scenario of independence structurally with the data-driven partition as well as new sampling complexity bounds for this detection. Finally, some experimental analyses provide evidence regarding our scheme\u2019s advantage for testing independence compared with some strategies that do not use data-driven representations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3135689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09652112.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"173","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3135689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Representations for Testing Independence: Modeling, Analysis and Connection With Mutual Information Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Representations for Testing Independence: Modeling, Analysis and Connection With Mutual Information Estimation","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9652112/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CONICYT-Chile","grantNumber":"1210315 and ANID-PFCHA/MagsterNacional/2019-22191445"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Center for Electrical and Electronic Engineering","grantNumber":"FB0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Representations for Testing Independence: Modeling, Analysis and Connection With Mutual Information Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-silva-3135689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11202S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9652112","onlineDate":"15 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9652157,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37088697837"},{"name":"Xiti Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xiti","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089201849"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2784-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2785-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2474-1531"}],"articleNumber":"9652157","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning algorithms","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Collaboration","Logic gates","Autonomous aerial vehicles","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","collaborative spectrum sensing","gated recurrent unit","multi-UAV network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652157","doi":"10.1109/ITNAC53136.2021.9652157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNAC53136.2021.9652157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9652127","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9652126/9652127/09652157.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-efficiency Collaborative Spectrum Sensing with Gated Recurrent Unit for Multi-UAV Network","abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in military and civil fields, and the collaborative multi-UAV network becomes increasingly popular. Cognitive radio (CR) is a feasible way to solve the problem that there is no authorized frequency band for UAV communication. However, the sensing performance of traditional algorithm based on a single artificial design feature is poor in the complex electromagnetic environment including low SNR, high noise-uncertainty, etc., which can not meet the requirement of the cognitive multi-UAV network. Spectrum sensing algorithms based on machine learning can obtain better performance and higher spectral efficiency (SE) by learning the potential feature and rules. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is widely accepted as naturally suitable for processing time series because of its structural characteristics. But the complexity of the algorithm based on LSTM is high due to its redundant structure, which is unsuitable for UAVs as the energy of UAV is always limited. In this paper, we propose a spectrum sensing algorithm based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We prove by theoretical derivation and simulation experiments separately that it can not only consume about 1/4 less energy for computation but also achieve slightly better sensing performance compare to the LSTM-based algorithm, which is meaningful. As cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can obtain better performance and is suitable for multi-UAV scenarios, we combine the proposed algorithm with a collaborative model which can improve system stability and reach a longer working time than the traditional collaboration model. In general, we propose a high-efficiency CSS scheme based on GRU for a multi-UAV network, which has higher sensing performance, less implementation complexity, and we verify it by theory or simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9652157/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2021","publicationDate":"24 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A High-efficiency Collaborative Spectrum Sensing with Gated Recurrent Unit for Multi-UAV Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-efficiency Collaborative Spectrum Sensing with Gated Recurrent Unit for Multi-UAV Network","confLoc":"Sydney, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570778591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080066S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9652126","isNumber":"9652127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9652126","xplore-issue":"9652127","articleId":"9652157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9652303,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Bahadori","affiliation":["Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Bahadori","id":"37085878747"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Sajad Sadough","affiliation":["Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad","lastName":"Sajad Sadough","id":"37085426960"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4225-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4226-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9652303","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["South America","NOMA","Simulation","Transceivers","Numerical models","Resource management","Visible light communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NOMA","VLC","RWP","GRPA","NSSR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652303","doi":"10.1109/SACVLC53127.2021.9652303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SACVLC53127.2021.9652303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9652196","publicationTitle":"2021 Third South American Colloquium on Visible Light Communications (SACVLC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third South American Colloquium on Visible Light Communications (SACVLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9652007/9652196/09652303.pdf","startPage":"01","endPage":"06","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sum Secrecy Rate of NOMA-Enabled VLC Network with the Random-Way Point Mobility Model","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a non-orthogonal multiple access enabled cellular visible light communication network, where all users present in the network are moving based on the random way-point mobility model.

This is generally carried out by human operators that are not able to inspect all the packages due to cadence restrictions. To overcome this limitation, a computer vision system that automatically performs 100% inline seal and closure inspection is proposed. In this paper, after evaluating pizza package features, the manual quality control procedure, and the packaging machines of a real industrial scenario, a detailed description of hardware and software components of the proposed system as well as the main design decisions are presented. Focusing on the hardware, line-scan technology and hyperspectral imaging has been considered to ensure that all relevant information can be acquired independently of the pizza brand, topping, and film features. Focusing on the software, this applies a three-phases strategy that, first, applies a set of basic rejection controls; second, identifies the sealing region; and third, prepares the data for prediction through the classification of the pizzas using a deep learning network. This network is one of the software key elements and has been selected after comparing the commercial off-the-shelf (pretrained-dl-classifier-resnet50 from MVTec Halcon) and the custom-developed (ResNet18) architectures designed to automate the accept/reject classification of pizza packages. To train the networks, a classification of pizza package defects, focusing on sealing and closure, and an image-based method able to automatically detect them have been proposed. The system has been tested in laboratory and in real industrial conditions comparing it with the manual scenario and considering three pizza brands with two toppings per brand. From the evaluation, it has been seen that ResNet18 achieves the best results with mean, maximum, and minimum precision values of 99.87%, 99.95%, and 99.74%, respectively. Moreover, our system achieves twice the throughput rate with respect to the manual scenario, with the guarantee that all pizzas are evaluated, which is not possible in the manual scenario due to operator fatigue. The proposed solution can be easily adapted to similar contexts, even considering packages with other shapes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09652515.pdf","startPage":"167267","endPage":"167281","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep-Learning Based Solution to Automatically Control Closure and Seal of Pizza Packages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep-Learning Based Solution to Automatically Control Closure and Seal of Pizza Packages","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9652515/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652515/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Doctorate Industrial Program through the Catalan Government (2018\u20132021)","grantNumber":"2018DI026"},{"fundingName":"Catalan Government","grantNumber":"2017-SGR-1101"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"MICIUPID2019-106426RB-C31"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences President\u2019s International Fellowship Initiative","grantNumber":"2021VTB0004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep-Learning Based Solution to Automatically Control Closure and Seal of Pizza Packages","sourcePdf":"access-banusparadell-3135973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161779S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9652515","onlineDate":"15 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":9652539,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Xue","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9652539/xue-3135903-small.gif","p":["Pengfei Xue received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2020.

As the number of antennas increases, the system overhead associated with beam management will increase dramatically. To address this overarching problem, a neural network-aided millimeter-wave beamforming algorithm is proposed in this paper. A new parameter, referred to as \u201cbeam adjustment interval\u201d, is proposed to evaluate the beamforming performance. It is defined as the maximum time duration in which the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the user equipment can be maintained above the predefined threshold. Besides, a predictive method of beam adjustment to maximize the beam adjustment interval is developed, which considers the SINR not only at the current location but also future possible locations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase beam adjustment interval and reduce the total number of beam adjustments for the moving user equipment, thus reducing the system overhead 41.4% on average over 10 randomly generated test traces.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135903","startPage":"165956","endPage":"165965","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09652539.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the System Overhead of Millimeter-Wave Beamforming With Neural Networks for 5G and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the System Overhead of Millimeter-Wave Beamforming With Neural Networks for 5G and Beyond","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9652539/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9652539/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1804901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100017090","fundingName":"Research and Development Center China, Sony (China) Ltd"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reducing the System Overhead of Millimeter-Wave Beamforming With Neural Networks for 5G and Beyond","sourcePdf":"access-xue-3135903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120202S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9652539","onlineDate":"15 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":9652769,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Seth U.

Deep learning classification algorithms have been used to recognize the wireless signal standards of emitters with high accuracy, but are limited to classifying signal classes that appear in their training set. This diminishes the performance of deep learning classifiers deployed in the field because they cannot accurately identify signals from classes outside of the training set. In this paper, a convolution neural network based open set classifier is proposed with the ability to detect signal that are not from known classes by thresholding the output sigmoid activation. The open set classifier was trained on 4G LTE, 5G NR, IEEE 802.11ax, Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0, and Narrowband Internet-of-Things signals impaired with Rayleigh or Rician fading, AWGN, frequency offsets, and in-phase/quadrature imbalances. Then, the classifier was tested on OFDM, SC-FDMA, SC, AM, and FM signals, which did not appear in the training set classes. The closed set classifier achieves an average accuracy of 94.5% for known signals with SNR's greater than 0 dB, but by design, the closed set classifier cannot detect signals from unknown classes. On the other hand, the open set classifier retains an 86% accuracy for known signal classes, but can detect 95.5% of signals from unknown classes with SNR's greater than 0 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9652880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM52596.2021.9653119","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2021 - 2021 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2021 - 2021 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9652874/9652880/09653119.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"762","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM52596.2021.9653119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open Set Wireless Standard Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2021-Dec. 2 2021","displayDocTitle":"Open Set Wireless Standard Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9653119/","publicationDate":"29 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9653119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"US Army Research Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open Set Wireless Standard Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570751719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056101S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2021-Dec. 2 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9652874","isNumber":"9652880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9652874","xplore-issue":"9652880","articleId":"9653119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9653262,"authors":[{"name":"Alperen Tun\u00e7","affiliation":["Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alperen","lastName":"Tun\u00e7","id":"37085982152"},{"name":"Mustafa Berke Yelten","affiliation":["Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa Berke","lastName":"Yelten","id":"37888779900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2585-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-2584-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2586-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9653262","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Voltage","Topology","Telecommunications","Power generation","Matlab"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doherty","efficiency","Class-AB","Class-B","Class-F"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9653262","abstract":"In this study, the efficiency performance of various classes in a Doherty power amplifier is investigated through theoretical calculations.

The common relay selection and beamforming optimization problem aiming to maximize the receiver\u2019s achievable rate under the constraint of relay transmit power is intrinsically hard since the mixed discrete and continuous variables. The direct map from channel state information to select a relay with optimized beamforming weights via data-driven methods often fails to yield good results. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a two-stage algorithm based on data-driven method. Firstly, we convert relay selection to a multi-class classification problem, and a support vector machine (SVM) based data-driven scheme is proposed to determine the best relay. After the relay is selected, we utilize a closed-form solution to obtain the corresponding relay beamforming weights. Since the number of relays is often more than two, the sample imbalance problem exists in the classification problem, considered in our proposed data-driven scheme. The core idea of SVM based classification method is to train the optimal parameters of the SVM classifier through a large number of offline sample data. In this way, the computation of relay selection can be transferred to offline SVM training. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is close to that of the global optimal relay selection scheme. Moreover, our proposed scheme has much lower complexities than the global optimal relay selection scheme, especially when the number of relays is large.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09654174.pdf","startPage":"167154","endPage":"167161","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven-Based Relay Selection and Cooperative Beamforming for Non-Regenerative Multi-Antenna Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven-Based Relay Selection and Cooperative Beamforming for Non-Regenerative Multi-Antenna Relay Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9654174/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9654174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61902084, 61872098 and 61872102"},{"fundingName":"Featured Innovation Project of Guangdong Education Department","grantNumber":"2018KTSCX174"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014881","fundingName":"Innovation Research for the Postgraduates of Guangzhou University","grantNumber":"2020GDJC-M02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Driven-Based Relay Selection and Cooperative Beamforming for Non-Regenerative Multi-Antenna Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-3136332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090051S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9654174","onlineDate":"16 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":9654219,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaotian Fu","affiliation":["CNAM CEDRIC/LAETITIA, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9668973/9654219/fu-3136303-small.gif","p":["Xiaotian Fu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2017, and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications and networks from Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers (CNAM), Paris, France, in 2018, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the CEDRIC Laboratory.

The iterative detectors, for example message passing algorithm (MPA), can provide near optimal multiuser detection (MUD) performance but becomes infeasible when the codebook size is large or the overloading factor is high. Recently, sphere decoding (SD) has been considered in the MUD of SCMA by rewriting the generalized transmission into a linear system. In this work, we first review the state-of-the-art SD-based detectors for SCMA: sphere decoding for SCMA (SD-SCMA) and generalized SD-SCMA (GSD-SCMA). We not only explain the state-of-the-art in a comprehensive way, but also exploit the sorted QR decomposition and Schnorr-Euchner enumeration to accelerate the tree search. Although GSD-SCMA overcomes the codebook constraint of SD-SCMA, its computational complexity is extremely sensitive to the overloading factor. To satisfy the trade-off between complexity and MUD performance, we propose two pruning algorithms, PRUN1 and PRUN2, and introduce the simplified GSD-SCMA (SGSD-SCMA). In the paper, error probabilities of the proposed pruning algorithms are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed detector outperforms the iterative detectors and SD-based state-of-the-art when the overloading factor is moderate and the codebook size is large.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9668973/09654219.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9668973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Sphere Decoding-Based Detector for Generalized SCMA Codebooks","volume":"10","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9654219/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9654219/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Simplified Sphere Decoding-Based Detector for Generalized SCMA Codebooks","sourcePdf":"access-fu-3136303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102967S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9668973","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9668973","articleId":"9654219","onlineDate":"16 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9654269,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangxin Zhou","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhangxin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086211547"},{"name":"Wenzong Wang","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Wenzong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086058957"},{"name":"Tian Lan","affiliation":["Burns & McDonnell, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Lan","id":"37085422981"},{"name":"Garng M.

However, it can potentially introduce frequency and power oscillations among multiple IBRs in a similar way as synchronous machines oscillate against each other. To overcome this challenge, a decentralized output feedback controller is proposed in this paper. The controller consists of two loops: output power feedback and frequency feedback. The controller parameters are tuned through an efficient gradient based method. A washout filter is also added to ensure that the steady state power sharing is not affected by the controller. Small signal and simulation case studies are conducted in test systems with different levels of inverter penetration. Results show that dynamic performance of the system can be improved by applying the proposed controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power system dynamics","Power system stability","Synchronous generators","Stability analysis","Steady-state","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feedback controller","gradient method","oscillation damping","virtual synchronous machine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NAPS52732.2021.9654269","publicationTitle":"2021 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9654273/9654259/09654269.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9654259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS52732.2021.9654269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decentralized Output Feedback Controller to Improve Power System Damping with Virtual Synchronous Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9654269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Decentralized Output Feedback Controller to Improve Power System Damping with Virtual Synchronous Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9654269/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"14 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9654269/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decentralized Output Feedback Controller to Improve Power System Damping with Virtual Synchronous Machines","confLoc":"College Station, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049785S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9654273","isNumber":"9654259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9654273","xplore-issue":"9654259","articleId":"9654269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9654370,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongxing Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhongxing","lastName":"Tian","id":"37089210313"},{"name":"Chenxu Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chenxu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37089214087"},{"name":"Shencheng Ni","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shencheng","lastName":"Ni","id":"37087128610"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089213860"},{"name":"Shuying Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Han","id":"37086957646"},{"name":"Shanhong You","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shanhong","lastName":"You","id":"37710407900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3195-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9654370","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"abstract":"In order to further improve the overall performance of the indoor multiple-input-multiple-output-visible-light-communication (MIMO-VLC) system, we use a hemispherical angle diversity receiver (ADR) to study and analyze the signal-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution and area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the ADR at different tilt angles with random rotation.

This paper addresses the partial observability issue of data-driven distribution modeling in order to improve the accuracy of line parameter estimation.

The alternating minimization scheme of guaranteed convergence is proposed to take advantage of convex subproblems with efficient solutions. Numerical results using realworld load data on the single-phase equivalent of the IEEE 123-bus test case have demonstrated the accuracy improvements of the proposed solution over existing work for

well as to reinforce information given in everyday discussions. The goal of Sign Language recognition is to recognize and comprehend important human body gestures. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that has lately gained traction in the recognition of sign languages. The current research focuses on how deep learning may be used to solve the challenge of identifying hand gestures in a collection of videos for emergency situations. To feed the model, a number of frames were taken from the videos. A pre-trained VGG-16 and a recurrent neural network with a large short-term memory make up the model (RNN-LSTM). The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on an Indian Sign Language Dataset of Hand Gestures for Emergency Situations. Deaf people can use sign language as a kind of emergency communication to help them deal with these circumstances. In this study, sign recognition could be utilised to address circumstances like pain, calling for help, or having to see a doctor.","doi":"10.1109/ICDABI53623.2021.9655842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDABI53623.2021.9655842","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry (ICDABI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9655702/9655771/09655842.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry (ICDABI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Emergency Situation: A Study on Indian Sign Language","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Emergency Situation: A Study on Indian Sign Language","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9655842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9655842/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Emergency Situation: A Study on Indian Sign Language","confLoc":"Sakheer, Bahrain","sourcePdf":"1570757763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087451S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9655702","isNumber":"9655771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9655702","xplore-issue":"9655771","articleId":"9655842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9656639,"authors":[{"name":"Tidhar Lambez","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9656639/lambe-3136810-small.gif","p":["Tidhar Lambez received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel, in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

The measurement drawn when observing a process follows one of two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. The goal is to design a policy that minimizes the Bayes risk which balances between the sample complexity, detection errors, and the switching cost associated with switching across processes. We develop a policy, dubbed consecutive controlled sensing (CCS), to achieve this goal. On the one hand, by contrast to existing studies on controlled sensing, the CCS policy senses processes consecutively to reduce the switching cost. On the other hand, the policy controls the sensing operation in a closed-loop manner to switch between processes when necessary to guarantee reliable inference. We prove theoretically that CCS is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the Bayes risk as the detection error approaches zero (i.e., the sample complexity increases). Simulation results demonstrate strong performance of CCS in the finite regime as well.

Such uncertainties and outliers make the true joint state-measurement distributions (induced by the true system model) deviate from the nominal ones (induced by the nominal system model) so that the performance of the optimal state estimator designed for the nominal model becomes unsatisfactory or even unacceptable in practice. The challenges are to quantitatively describe the uncertainties in the model and the outliers in the measurements, and then robustify the estimator in a right way. This article studies a distributionally robust state estimation framework for linear systems subject to parameter uncertainties and measurement outliers. It utilizes a family of distributions near the nominal one to implicitly describe the uncertainties and outliers, and the robust state estimation in the worst case is made over the least-favorable distribution. The advantages of the presented framework include: 1) it only uses a few scalars to parameterize the method and does not require the structural information of uncertainties; 2) it generalizes several classical filters (e.g., the fading Kalman filter, risk-sensitive Kalman filter, relative-entropy Kalman filter, outlier-insensitive Kalman filters) into a unified framework. We show that the distributionally robust state estimation problem can be reformulated into a linear semi-definite program and in some special cases it can be analytically solved. Comprehensive comparisons with existing state estimation frameworks that are insensitive to parameter uncertainties and measurement outliers are also conducted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9656678/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9656678/","displayDocTitle":"Distributionally Robust State Estimation for Linear Systems Subject to Uncertainty and Outlier","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"72071138"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 1","grantNumber":"R-266-000-145-114"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributionally Robust State Estimation for Linear Systems Subject to Uncertainty and Outlier","sourcePdf":"tsp-ye-3136804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15673S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9656678","onlineDate":"20 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9656827,"authors":[{"name":"Diaa Salman","affiliation":["Cyprus International University, Nicosia Northern Cyprus Mersin 10, Turkey"],"firstName":"Diaa","lastName":"Salman","id":"37089216368"},{"name":"Mehmet Kusaf","affiliation":["Cyprus International University, Nicosia Northern Cyprus Mersin 10, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Kusaf","id":"37858117900"},{"name":"Yonis Khalif Elmi","affiliation":["Cyprus International University, Nicosia Northern Cyprus Mersin 10, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yonis Khalif","lastName":"Elmi","id":"37089209905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0598-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0597-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2062-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9656827","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9656827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Energy consumption","Recurrent neural networks","Machine learning algorithms","Load forecasting","Weather forecasting","Power systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural network","load demand forecasting","day Ahead forecasting","year Ahead forecasting"]}],"abstract":"The rate of growth of countries all over the world is increasing dramatically and is unavoidable, resulting in an increase in energy consumption.

We train a neural network to predict sparse keypoints with associated descriptors and scores that can be used together with a classical pose estimator for localization. Our training pipeline includes a differentiable pose estimator such that training can be supervised with ground truth poses from data collected earlier, in our case from 2016 and 2017 gathered with multi-experience Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R). We insert the learned features into the existing VT&R pipeline to perform closed-loop path following in unstructured outdoor environments. We show successful path following across all lighting conditions despite the robot\u2019s map being constructed using daylight conditions. Moreover, we explore generalizability of the features by driving the robot across all lighting conditions in new areas not present in the feature training dataset. In all, we validated our approach with 35.5 km of autonomous path following experiments in challenging conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Robots","Visualization","Pipelines","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","deep learning for visual perception","vision-based navigation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3136867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/9647862/09657202.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3136867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keeping an Eye on Things: Deep Learned Features for Long-Term Visual Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9657202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Keeping an Eye on Things: Deep Learned Features for Long-Term Visual Localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9657202/","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9657202/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Clearpath Robotics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keeping an Eye on Things: Deep Learned Features for Long-Term Visual Localization","sourcePdf":"lra-gridseth-3136867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138588S","chronDate":"April  2022","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9647862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9647862","articleId":"9657202","onlineDate":"21 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9657704,"authors":[{"name":"Brigitte Schweisthal","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Politehnica University Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Brigitte","lastName":"Schweisthal","id":"37086557635"},{"name":"Mihaela Lascu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Politehnica University Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"Lascu","id":"37369819000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4000-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4001-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-5145"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2575-5137"}],"articleNumber":"9657704","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9657704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Retinopathy","Neural networks","Parallel processing","Retina","Diabetes","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["diabetic retinopathy","deep learning","convolutional neural network","hyper-parameters optimization","classification"]}],"abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the retina blood vessels, and can lead to vision loss if it is not treated or detected in initial phases.

Indeed, while these operators are associated with instantaneous frequency estimators very accurate on specific types of modes, the quality of the former worsens drastically when the modes depart from the ideal case they are designed for. We show in this paper that this particularly true when the modes interfere in the time-frequency plane or when some noise is present. Based on that analysis, we propose a novel instantaneous frequency estimator that only makes use of some specific points located on the ridges of synchrosqueezing transforms, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art techniques based on the same type of time-frequency representations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency estimation","Chirp","Harmonic analysis","Frequency modulation","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Fourier-based synchrosqueezing transform","reassignment methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3137080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09658198.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3137080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Reassignment Operators Used in Synchrosqueezing Transforms: With an Application to Instantaneous Frequency Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Reassignment Operators Used in Synchrosqueezing Transforms: With an Application to Instantaneous Frequency Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9658198/","volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9658198/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University Grenoble Alpes"},{"fundingName":"IRS Grant AMUSETE"},{"fundingName":"ANR ASCETE Project","grantNumber":"ANR-19-CE48-0001-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Reassignment Operators Used in Synchrosqueezing Transforms: With an Application to Instantaneous Frequency Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-meignen-3137080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072782S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9658198","onlineDate":"21 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9658415,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"9658415","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2021 Index IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits Vol. 56","abstract":"This index covers all technical items - papers, correspondence, reviews, etc. - that appeared in this periodical during the year, and items from previous years that were commented upon or corrected in this year.

As the EMT transfers useful knowledge across tasks to guide the search while the optimization process progresses online, superior search performance has been obtained in many recent attempts. Autoencoding evolutionary multitasking is a recently proposed EMT algorithm, which employs a single-layer denoising auto-encoder for knowledge transfer. However, since the autoencoding evolutionary multitasking (AEEMT) algorithm learns the relationships between tasks through a linear auto-encoder, it may lead to negative transfer in cases that the linear variable relationship does not hold across tasks. Taking this cue, we propose an evolutionary multitasking algorithm with artificial neural networks for transferring knowledge across tasks in this paper, which possesses higher modeling capability of variable relationships. To test and verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known single-objectives multi-task optimization benchmarks. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method has a remarkable effect on the evolutionary search in terms of both search speed and solution quality and comparing to the autoencoding evolutionary multitasking algorithms and the single-task evolutionary counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9659031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9659031/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2022","publicationDate":"17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Multitasking via Artificial Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Multitasking via Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, Australia","sourcePdf":"0665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111926S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9658572","isNumber":"9658575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9658572","xplore-issue":"9658575","articleId":"9659031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9659174,"authors":[{"name":"Max Bolderman","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Bolderman","id":"37089226040"},{"name":"Mircea Lazar","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Lazar","id":"37300757700"},{"name":"Hans Butler","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Butler","id":"37389818500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3643-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3644-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0770"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0762"}],"articleNumber":"9659174","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Ever\u2013increasing throughput specifications in semiconductor manufacturing require operating high\u2013precision mechatronics, such as linear motors, at higher accelerations.

Later, we ensembled thrice with multiple combinations of the models to enhance our outcome.

The agent has to learn to drive from disengagements, which occurs when it drives off the track.

However, due to the increasing complexity of robotic structures, modelling robots is becoming more and more challenging, and analytical models are very difficult to build, particularly for redundant robots. Machine learning approaches have shown great capabilities in learning complex mapping and have widely been used in robot model learning and control. Generally, inverse kinematics is learned, directly obtaining the desired control commands given a desired task. However, learning forward kinematics is simpler and allows the computation of the robot Jacobian and enables the exploitation of the optimality of controllers. Nevertheless, typical learning methods have no knowledge about the differential relationship between the position and velocity mappings. In this work, we present two novel loss functions to train feedforward Artificial Neural network (ANN) which incorporate this information in learning the forward kinematic model of robotic structures, and carry out a comparison with standard ANN training using position data only. Simulation results show that incorporating the knowledge of the velocity mapping improves the suitability of the learnt model for control tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Analytical models","Simulation","Robot kinematics","Kinematics","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659415","publicationTitle":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9658571/9659314/09659415.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9659314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmenting Loss Functions of Feedforward Neural Networks with Differential Relationships for Robot Kinematic Modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9659415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Augmenting Loss Functions of Feedforward Neural Networks with Differential Relationships for Robot Kinematic Modelling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9659415/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9659415/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmenting Loss Functions of Feedforward Neural Networks with Differential Relationships for Robot Kinematic Modelling","confLoc":"Ljubljana, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"0032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089371S","chronDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9658571","isNumber":"9659314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9658571","xplore-issue":"9659314","articleId":"9659415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9659449,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In case the system nonlinearities are relevant fault diagnosis tools relying on the linear assumption may provide unsatisfactory results in terms of false alarms and missed detections. In this paper, non-linear Additive Models are proposed to characterize non-linear redundancy relations existing between the system signals. These relations have been identified directly from data using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) algorithm. Then, the non-linear redundancy relations have been linearized in order to derive a local (time-dependent) fault signature matrix. The fault signature matrix is then used within a directional residual-based Fault Isolation procedure to isolate additive sensor failures. A quantitative analysis has been performed exploiting real multi-flight data of a semi-autonomous aircraft, making a detailed comparison with a state-of-the-art Fault Isolation method based on linear redundancy relations.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659449","startPage":"750","endPage":"756","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9658571/9659314/09659449.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9659314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on Nonlinear Additive Models and Local Fault Sensitivity*","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on Nonlinear Additive Models and Local Fault Sensitivity*","conferenceDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","publicationDate":"6 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9659449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9659449/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010607","fundingName":"University of Perugia","grantNumber":"RICBA18MF,RICBA19MLF,RICBA20MF"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on Nonlinear Additive Models and Local Fault Sensitivity*","confLoc":"Ljubljana, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"0178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115803S","chronDate":"6-10 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9658571","isNumber":"9659314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9658571","xplore-issue":"9659314","articleId":"9659449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9659737,"authors":[{"name":"Shamim Akhtar","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Shamim","lastName":"Akhtar","id":"37089224220"},{"name":"Muhamad Zahim bin Sujod","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhamad Zahim bin","lastName":"Sujod","id":"37294188600"},{"name":"Syed Sajjad Hussain Rizvi","affiliation":["Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institiite of Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Sajjad","lastName":"Hussain Rizvi","id":"37088381251"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-2713-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2715-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2409-2983"}],"articleNumber":"9659737","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Systematics","Production","Pressing","Feature extraction","Energy efficiency","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy management","data driven","deep learning","machine learning","energy efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9659737","abstract":"The Energy Management System (EMS) is the cost-effectiveness, robustness, and flexible approach for energy efficiency management (EEM). Data-Driven Energy Efficiency Management (D2EEM) is a recent advancement in EMS. The D2EEM is the blend of data science and artificial intelligence for EEM. Due to the highly tolerant to the performance plateau and unconstraint to the feature extraction, Deep Learning (DL) facilitates handling big data-driven problems of EEM. To the best of the knowledge, the accurate and robust D2EEM is the pressing need. Moreover, the accurate pre-trained DL network for EEM is not available in the recent literature. In this work, a comprehensive study is presented to devise a D2EEM. Moreover, the architecture is suggested in connection to the research gap.","doi":"10.1109/ICEET53442.2021.9659737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEET53442.2021.9659737","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies (ICEET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9659488/9659490/09659737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies (ICEET)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9659490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Data-Driven Energy Efficiency Management (D2EEM) - Systematic Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Data-Driven Energy Efficiency Management (D2EEM) - Systematic Survey","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"27 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9659737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9659737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Data-Driven Energy Efficiency Management (D2EEM) - Systematic Survey","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper_111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117579S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9659488","isNumber":"9659490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9659488","xplore-issue":"9659490","articleId":"9659737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"}]
