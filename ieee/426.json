Previously published work has explained the fixed pattern noise (FPN) in these image sensors using a steady-state analysis. This paper explains how the transient response of the readout circuit may also contribute to FPN. Thus, the performance of these CMOS cameras may be optimized with a proper understanding of the transient response, which is explained here through modeling and simulation with some experimental validation. In particular, the gain variation of a logarithmic camera is shown to be caused primarily by premature digitization. As logarithmic and linear active pixel sensors use similar circuits, some results in this paper, e.g., an analysis of readout capacitance, apply equally to the latter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4214860/04260982.pdf","startPage":"1191","endPage":"1199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2007.900974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2007.900974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4214860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4260982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Response and Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient response","CMOS image sensors","Cameras","Circuit noise","Image sensors","Steady-state","Image analysis","Pattern analysis","Semiconductor device modeling","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","CMOS image sensors","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logarithmic pixels","premature digitization","steady-state analysis","logarithmic CMOS image sensors","fixed pattern noise","transient response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed pattern noise (FPN)","logarithmic pixels","modeling and calibration","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4260982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Transient Response and Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4260982/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619902","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Response and Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"07jsen08-joseph.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071432S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4214860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4214860","articleId":"4260982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4260987,"authors":[{"name":"Anuj K.

The implemented design techniques consist of a more efficient memory databus, the exploitation of the dynamic read stability of SRAM cells, a new low-swing write technique and a distributed decoder. An 8-KB 5T SRAM was fabricated in a 0.18-mum technology. The measurement results confirm the feasibility and the usefulness of the proposed techniques.

These flexible analog circuits are driven by a network-on-chip (NoC) that is able to set performance parameters like cut-off frequency, selectivity, noise, and gain guaranteeing at any time a near-optimal power/performance trade-off. A design approach is proposed to tackle the challenges imposed by flexibility in analog design. A silicon prototype is realized in 0.13-mum CMOS technology with 1.2-V supply voltage to prove the validity of the proposed solution. The LPF provides a frequency tuning range between 0.35 MHz and 23.5 MHz with an adaptive integrated noise level between 85 muVrms and 163 muVrms whereby the power consumption conveniently varies from 0.72 mW to 21.6 mW according to the required performance.

Although the CMOS is suitable for short- range radar since processing units can be implemented in the same chip as the UWB front-end building block, it is difficult to operate CMOS pulse generators at such a high frequency. To realize the pseudo-millimeter-wave band using CMOS, we have proposed a new pulse generator consisting of a series of delay cells and edge combiners with waveform shaping for short-range radar. As a result of measurement using 90-nm CMOS technology, 1 Gb/s/bit pulses with 71 mV peak-to-peak, 39.2 ps monopulse width and 552 ps envelope width are successfully generated with a power consumption of 1.4 mW at a supply voltage of 0.91 V. This result can be the basis for developing the key technology for one-chip short-range radar sensors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4260994/04261016.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.899099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.899099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4260994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"22\u201329 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Pulse Generator for Short-Range Radar Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Pulse generation","Radar applications","CMOS technology","Ultra wideband radar","Intelligent transportation systems","CMOS process","Pulse measurements","Automotive engineering","Road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MMIC","pulse generators","road safety","road vehicle radar","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform shaping","edge combiners","delay cells","UWB front-end","intelligent transportation","road safety","automotive radar systems","MMIC","ultra-wideband CMOS pulse generator","power 1.4 mW","voltage 71 mV","bit rate 1 Gbit/s","voltage 910 mV","frequency 22 GHz to 29 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","high speed","low cost","low power","pulse generator","22\u201329-GHz UWB radar sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"22\u201329 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Pulse Generator for Short-Range Radar Applications","volume":"42","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4261016/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598926","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"22\u201329 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Pulse Generator for Short-Range Radar Applications","sourcePdf":"42jssc07-oncu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064912S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4260994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4260994","articleId":"4261016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4261019,"authors":[{"name":"Aminghasem Safarian","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA","Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4260994/4261019/4261019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aminghasem Safarian received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2002, respectively.

The OSP detector (equivalent to the least-squares estimator) is a popular detector utilizing background signature information. On the other hand, the MFD is intended for a model without background information, and it is often used for its simplicity. The OSP detector seems to be more reliable because it removes the interference of background signatures. However, it has been demonstrated in the literature that sometimes the MFD can be more powerful. In this paper, we show an innovative approach to the evaluation of the detectors' performance. We prove the analytical results explaining the relationship between the two detectors beyond the anecdotal evidence from specific hyperspectral images or simulations. We also give some guidelines on when the MFD may be more beneficial than the OSP and when the OSP is better because of being more robust against a wide range of conditions. A major contribution of this paper is a development of a new approach to the comparison of detectors.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.896544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2394","endPage":"2402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.896544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261022","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4261022/04261024.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Matched filters","Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Performance analysis","Object detection","Interference","Analytical models","Guidelines","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","matched filters","signal detection","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OSP","orthogonal subspace projection detector","MFD","matched filter detector","background signatures interference","least-squares estimator","linear mixing model","subpixel target detection","analytical comparison","hyperspectral images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detection power","hyperspectral image","linear mixing model (LMM)","matched filter","orthogonal subspace projection (OSP)","structured background","target detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Comparison of the Matched Filter and Orthogonal Subspace Projection Detectors for Hyperspectral Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261024/","volume":"45","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4261024/","accessionNumber":"9596712","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Comparison of the Matched Filter and Orthogonal Subspace Projection Detectors for Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"45tgrs07-bajorski-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073559S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4261022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4261022","articleId":"4261024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4261051,"authors":[{"name":"Tanos M.

Unlike the SSA, the model also achieves agreement with the Kirchhoff approximation in the high-frequency limit even for penetrable surfaces.

In order to reduce the impact of phase errors on the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-generated DEM, an external DEM such as that from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is utilized in this approach. The proposed algorithm includes two steps: The first step is to model and remove phase trends with a linear regression analysis before converting phase to height; the second step is to filter unreliable height points before interpolating the DEM from the InSAR height map. The critical points are the following: 1) determining the one-to-one correspondence between the interferogram and the SRTM DEM before knowing the InSAR-derived elevation values and 2) estimating the elevation range of every pixel from SRTM DEM. To solve the first problem, an iteratively geocoding algorithm is performed. A DEM interpolation error model solves the second one. For InSAR data processing, the SRTM DEM is not only usable for modeling systematic phase errors but also for filtering gross height errors. The experiments in Zhangbei and the Three Gorges areas in China show that our approach has improved the accuracy of the resulting DEMs significantly without any ground control points.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of DEMs From ERS-1/2 Tandem Data in Mountainous Area Facilitated by SRTM Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.896546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4261022/04261064.pdf","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.896546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of DEMs From ERS-1/2 Tandem Data in Mountainous Area Facilitated by SRTM Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4261064/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596716","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of DEMs From ERS-1/2 Tandem Data in Mountainous Area Facilitated by SRTM Data","sourcePdf":"45tgrs07-liao-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062231S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4261022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4261022","articleId":"4261064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4261076,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Pulvirenti","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4261027/4261076/4261076-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Pulvirenti (M'07) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetism from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","He presently holds a Postdoctoral position in the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d teaching a course on electromagnetic propagation.

A critical aspect is the long computational time that is required to run the forward model, which hampers the creation of large training databases or iterative simulations within retrieval algorithms. To tackle this problem, a neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this paper. In particular, we have adopted NNs to emulate a simulator named SEAWIND, which implements the two-scale model and was validated in previous works. Two training algorithms, including a regularized approach, have been considered and compared. The assessment of the proposed approach has been carried out by statistically comparing neural-network-derived simulations with SEAWIND-derived ones for two validation data sets comprising different climatic conditions, as well as by computing the azimuthal Fourier harmonic coefficients versus wind speed and atmospheric transmittance. Regressive model functions have also been used as benchmarks. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an NN approach to efficient and effective modeling of sea-surface thermal emission and scattering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9605752","volume":"45","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4261076/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling Microwave Fully Polarimetric Passive Observations of the Sea Surface: A Neural Network Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Microwave Fully Polarimetric Passive Observations of the Sea Surface: A Neural Network Approach","sourcePdf":"45tgrs07-pulvirenti-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11108S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4261027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4261027","articleId":"4261076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4261133,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Trimberger","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Trimberger","id":"37297561500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261133","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":551},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Manufacturing processes","Computer aided manufacturing","Testing","Process design","Information security","Cryptography","Protection","Packaging","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design","trusted design problem","bitstream security feature","cryptographic information security solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Security","FPGA","Trusted Design","Cryptography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261133","abstract":"Using FPGAs, a designer can separate the design process from the manufacturing flow.

In particular, energy consumption and distributing a single global clock signal throughout a chip have become major design bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, a globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) design is considered for achieving low power consumption and modular design. Such a design style fits nicely with the concept of voltage-frequency islands (VFIs) which has been recently introduced for achieving fine-grain system-level power management. This paper proposes a design methodology for partitioning an NoC architecture into multiple VFIs and assigning supply and threshold voltage levels to each VFI Simulation results show about 40% savings for a real video application and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the overall system energy consumption.

Experiments using both real-life and artificial benchmarks were performed and results show that, by using the proposed scheme, significant energy reduction is obtained.","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261157.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Synthesis of Networks-on-Chip Implemented with Voltage Islands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261157/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Synthesis of Networks-on-Chip Implemented with Voltage Islands","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866921","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261157/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Synthesis of Networks-on-Chip Implemented with Voltage Islands","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06544S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4261158,"authors":[{"name":"Assaf Shacham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Assaf","lastName":"Shacham","id":"37269247400"},{"name":"Keren Bergman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Keren","lastName":"Bergman","id":"37278923800"},{"name":"Luca P.

We make the case for a hybrid approach to NoC design that combines a photonic transmission layer with an electronic control layer. A comparative power analysis with a fully-electronic NoC shows that large bandwidths can be exchanged at dramatically lower power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261158.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case for Low-Power Photonic Networks on Chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Photonic integrated circuits","Bandwidth","Silicon","Optical buffering","Energy consumption","Optical control","Optical fiber communication","Joining processes","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","optical communication equipment","optical fibre networks","optoelectronic devices","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power photonic networks on chip","packet-switched networks on chip","natural communication mechanism","chip multiprocessors","power budget problem","nanometer technologies","NoC design","photonic transmission layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Performance","Network-on-Chip","Optical Communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Case for Low-Power Photonic Networks on Chip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866922","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case for Low-Power Photonic Networks on Chip","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072951S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261174,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Jen-Wei Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Wei","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"38181876800"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tei-Wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37276775300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261174","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":938},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Protocols","Permission","Computer science","Reliability engineering","Design engineering","Computer network reliability","Multimedia systems","Computer network management","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","logic design","NAND circuits","semiconductor device reliability","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["endurance enhancement","flash memory storage systems","static wear leveling design","reliability enhancement","NAND flash translation layer protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Experimentation","Management","Measurement","Performance","Reliability","flash memory","wear leveling","endurance","reliability"]}],"abstract":"This work is motivated by the strong demand of reliability enhancement over flash memory.

This paper presents a novel SPM space utilization strategy, for embedded chip multi-processor systems, based on recomputing the value of an off-chip data element using on-chip (SPM resident) data elements. In doing so, our goal is to eliminate the corresponding off-chip memory access that would otherwise be performed, and save execution cycles and power. This paper presents the details of a compiler algorithm that implements this approach and reports the experimental data we collected using six data-intensive applications. Our results indicate that, on a four processor chip multiprocessor, the average performance improvement our approach brings is about 11.8%, over a state-of-the-art SPM management scheme. We also observed that there is a specific range of total SPM size/total data size ratios, for which our approach generates the best results. Finally, our results also show that the proposed approach brings consistent improvements when the number of CPUs is varied between 2 and 16.","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261176.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Off-Chip Memory Access Costs Using Data Recomputation in Embedded Chip Multi-processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Off-Chip Memory Access Costs Using Data Recomputation in Embedded Chip Multi-processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261176/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866939","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261176/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Off-Chip Memory Access Costs Using Data Recomputation in Embedded Chip Multi-processors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072329S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4261182,"authors":[{"name":"Amith Singhee","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Amith","lastName":"Singhee","id":"37298467800"},{"name":"Rob A.

It consists of complementary metal- oxide semiconductor (CMOS) reconfigurable logic and interconnect fabric, and carbon nanotube-based non-volatile on- chip configuration memory. Compared to existing CMOS- based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), NATURE increases logic density by more than an order of magnitude and offers cycle-by-cycle run-time reconfiguration capability. As opposed to some other recently proposed hybrid nano/CMOS designs, which mostly rely on the not-yet-mature self-assembly fabrication process, NATURE is compatible with mainstream photolithography fabrication techniques. Thus, NATURE offers a commercially feasible technology with high performance, superior integration density, and excellent run-time flexibility. In this paper, we present an integrated design and optimization platform for NATURE, called NanoMap. Given an input design specified in register-transfer level (RTL) and/or gate-level VHDL, NanoMap optimizes and implements the design on NATURE through logic mapping, temporal clustering, placement, and routing. NATURE offers a highly- efficient computation model, called temporal logic folding. A logic circuit can be arbitrarily folded into a sequence of logic stages, which temporally share and execute on the same hardware resource using fine-grain run-time reconfiguration. To effectively leverage this feature, we propose and develop novel mapping techniques which can automatically explore and identify the best temporal logic folding configuration, targeting area, delay or area-delay product. It uses a force- directed scheduling technique to optimize and balance resource usage across different folding cycles. It provides significant design flexibility in performing area-delay tradeoffs under various user-specified constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that NanoMap can judiciously trade off area and delay, and effectively exploit the different features of NATURE.","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261195.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NanoMap: An Integrated Design Optimization Flow for a Hybrid Nanotube/CMOS Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NanoMap: An Integrated Design Optimization Flow for a Hybrid Nanotube/CMOS Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261195/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866957","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261195/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NanoMap: An Integrated Design Optimization Flow for a Hybrid Nanotube/CMOS Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10207S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261200,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To this end, we introduce accurate hardware models for addition and subtraction operations in terms of gate-level metrics, under both signed and unsigned representations. Our algorithm not only computes the best design solution among those that have the same number of operations, but is also able to find better area solutions using a non-minimum number of operations.

We show that a good quadratic placement, followed by local wirelength-driven spreading can produce excellent results on large-scale industrial ASIC designs. As opposed to the current top performing academic placers [4,7,11], RQL does not embed a linearization technique within the solver. Instead, it only requires a simpler, pure quadratic objective function in the spirit of [8,10,23]. Experimental results show that RQL outperforms all available academic placers on the ISPD-2005 placement contest benchmarks. In particular, RQL obtains an average wire- length improvement of 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.4%, 8.5%, and 14.6% versus mPL6 [5], NTUPlaceS [7], Kraflwerk [20], APlace2.0 [11], and Capo10.2 [18], respectively. In addition, RQL is three, seven, and ten times faster than mpL6, Capo10.2, and APlace2.0, respectively.

In this paper, we present the first routing algorithm in the literature for the pre-assignment flip-chip routing problem with a pre-defined netlist among pads and wire-width and signal-skew considerations. Our algorithm is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and guarantees to find an optimal solution for the addressed problem. It adopts a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, it first uses two reduction techniques to prune redundant solutions and create a global-routing path for each net. Without loss of the solution optimality, our reduction techniques can further prune the ILP variables (constraints) by 85.5% (98.0%) on average over a recent reduction technique. The detailed routing applies X-based grid- less routing to complete the routing. Experimental results based on five real industry designs show that our router can achieve 100% routability and the optimal global-routing wirelength and satisfy all signal-skew constraints, under reasonable CPU times, while recent related work results in much inferior solution quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integer Linear Programming Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Design","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261254.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Integer Linear Programming Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Design","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261254/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867014","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integer Linear Programming Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Design","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056217S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261258,"authors":[{"name":"Brent Goplen","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Essex Junction, VT, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Goplen","id":"37552476900"},{"name":"Sachin Sapatnekar","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Sapatnekar","id":"37276061900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261258","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Placement of 3D ICs with Thermal and Interlayer Via Considerations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal conductivity","Algorithm design and analysis","Heat sinks","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Routing","Integrated circuit technology","Power distribution","Power dissipation","Temperature distribution","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D IC","three-dimensional integrated circuits","partitioning-based techniques","thermal effects","counts effects","deleterious effects","wirelengths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","Design","Experimentation","Performance","3-D IC","3-D VLSI","thermal optimization","temperature","placement","interlayer vias"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261258","abstract":"Thermal problems and limitations on interlayer via densities are important design constraints on three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), and need to be considered during global and detailed placement.

This method allows wirelengths to be minimized for any desired interlayer via density and temperatures to be reduced while minimizing deleterious effects on wirelength and interlayer via counts.

We first analyze energy consumption both with and without a cutoff technique in standby mode. Two parameters are proposed to capture the cutoff structure's effect on the energy consumption. Second, a methodology to minimize the total energy consumption is addressed The selection of the cutoff structure is examined by comparing three different structures. Then, a co-optimization method to optimize the size of the cutoff structure concurrently with the supply voltage, is proposed.

These systems use multiprocessor systems-on-chip of which it must be guaranteed that enough resources are available for each application to meet its throughput constraints. This requires a task binding and scheduling mechanism that provides timing guarantees for each application independent of other applications while taking into account the available processor space, memory and communication bandwidth. Synchronous dataflow graphs (SDFGs) are used to model time-constrained multimedia applications. They allow modeling of cyclic, multi- rate dependencies between tasks. However, existing resource allocation techniques can only deal with acyclic and/or single-rate dependencies. Dependencies in an SDFG can be expressed in single-rate form, but then the problem size may increase exponentially making resource allocation infeasible. This paper presents a new resource allocation strategy which works directly on SDFGs, building on an efficient technique to calculate throughput of a bound and scheduled SDFG. Experimental results show that the strategy is effective in terms of run-time and allocated resources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","startPage":"777","endPage":"782","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261288.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiprocessor Resource Allocation for Throughput-Constrained Synchronous Dataflow Graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261288/","displayDocTitle":"Multiprocessor Resource Allocation for Throughput-Constrained Synchronous Dataflow Graphs","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867046","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiprocessor Resource Allocation for Throughput-Constrained Synchronous Dataflow Graphs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085409S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4261291,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Simon Kramer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37080072100"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261291","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"Adaptation in embedded processing is key in order to address efficiency. The concept of extensible embedded processors works well if a few a-priori known hot spots exist. However, they are far less efficient if many and possible at-design-time-unknown hot spots need to be dealt with. Our RISPP approach advances the extensible processor concept by providing flexibility through runtime adaptation by what we call \"instruction rotation\". It allows sharing resources in a highly flexible scheme of compatible components (called atoms and molecules). As a result, we achieve high speed-ups at moderate additional hardware. Furthermore, we can dynamically tradeoff between area and speed-up through runtime adaptation.

NRG dramatically increases the leakage current and requires geometry dependent transistor models for post-litho circuit simulation, hi this paper, we propose a coherent modeling approach for non-rectangular gates based on equivalent gate length (L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n). A gate-voltage dependent model of Le is developed which is scalable with design conditions, continuous across weak and strong inversion regions, accurate for both leakage and saturation current, and compatible with standard circuit analysis tools. We systematically verify this approach with 65 nm TCAD simulations. A generic CAD algorithm is further proposed to predict the value of Le under various non-rectangular geometries. The interaction with the narrow-width effect is efficiently convolved in this method. Depending on the gate geometry, the leakage current can vary more than 15X at 65 nm technology node. Our analytical method well captures this effect. Finally, we extrapolate the impact of NRG effect on future technology generations. The proposed model can be easily extracted from TCAD tools or direct silicon data. It bridges the gap between lithography, simulation, and circuit analysis for measuring transistor performance under increasingly severe NRG effect.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","endPage":"828","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261297.pdf","startPage":"823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Non-Rectangular Gate for Post-Lithography Circuit Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261297/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Non-Rectangular Gate for Post-Lithography Circuit Simulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867055","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261297/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Non-Rectangular Gate for Post-Lithography Circuit Simulation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079247S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261314,"authors":[{"name":"Amilcar do Carmo Lucas","affiliation":["Institute for Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Amilcar","lastName":"do Carmo Lucas","id":"37085935249"},{"name":"Sven Heithecker","affiliation":["Institute for Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Heithecker","id":"37564305700"},{"name":"Rolf Ernst","affiliation":["Institute for Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37297213900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261314","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Image storage","Software libraries","Digital signal processing","Software architecture","Streaming media","SDRAM","Spine","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FlexWAFE","high-end real-time stream processing library","FPGA","digital film processing","ASIC","FlexFilm project","Xilinx Virtex-II Pro","reconfigurable image stream processing","SDRAM memories","multiple frame storage","PCI Express communication backbone network","VHDL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Performance","digital film","FPGA","reconfigurable","stream-based architecture","weakly-programmable","VLIW","communication centric"]}],"abstract":"Digital film processing is characterized by a resolution of at least 2 K (2048times1536 pixels per frame at 30 bit/pixel and 24 pictures/s, data rate of 2.2 Gbit/s); higher resolutions of 4 K (8.8 Gbit/s) and even 8 K (35.2 Gbit/s) are on their way. Real-time processing at this data rate is beyond the scope of today's standard and DSP processors, and ASICs are not economically viable due to the small market volume. As an answer to these challenges, an FPGA-based approach was followed in the FlexFilm project. The multi-board, multi-FPGA hardware/software architecture is based on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs which contain the reconfigurable image stream processing data path, large external SDRAM memories for multiple frame storage, and a PCI Express communication backbone network. Different applications are supported on a single hardware platform by using different FPGA configurations. This paper will focus on the FlexWAFE framework, a component library consisting of parameterizable modules for real-time stream processing including memory and communication controllers. Some of the library blocks' parameters are set at synthesis time via VHDL generics, while others are run-time configurable. This combination allows some flexibility without sacrificing FPGA area or speed.","doi":"10.1109/DAC.2007.375295","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261314.pdf","startPage":"916","endPage":"921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.2007.375295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FlexWAFE - A High-end Real-Time Stream Processing Library for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261314/","displayDocTitle":"FlexWAFE - A High-end Real-Time Stream Processing Library for FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261314/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867072","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlexWAFE - A High-end Real-Time Stream Processing Library for FPGAs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056481S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4261317,"authors":[{"name":"Kunhyuk Kang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kunhyuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37292233800"},{"name":"Keejong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Keejong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292676500"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261317","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","Phase locked loops","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Temperature sensors","Timing","Phase detection","Degradation","Negative bias temperature instability","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","low-power electronics","oscillators","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variation resilient low-power circuit design","on-chip phase locked loop","negative bias temperature instability","voltage controlled oscillator","adaptive body bias","ripple carry adder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","System Reliability","Process Variation","NBTI","PLL"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a variation resilient circuit design technique for maintaining parametric yield of design under inherent variation in process parameters.

Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on post-synthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time-consuming, but it also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Moreover, post-synthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; non-routable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a droplet-routing-aware automated synthesis tool for microfluidic biochips. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis flow. The proposed approach allows architectural-level design choices and droplet-routing-aware physical design decisions to be made simultaneously. We use a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method.","publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261320.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Droplet Routing in the Synthesis of Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Droplet Routing in the Synthesis of Microfluidic Biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867078","htmlLink":"/document/4261320/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Droplet Routing in the Synthesis of Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063291S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261326,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Shih Su","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Shih","lastName":"Su","id":"37534940900"},{"name":"Da-Chung Wang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Da-Chung","lastName":"Wang","id":"38272923100"},{"name":"Shih-Chieh Chang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Chieh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37281063400"},{"name":"Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska","affiliation":["University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Marek-Sadowska","id":"37274844200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-627-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"4261326","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Delay","Adders","Logic design","Clocks","Throughput","Optical design","Logic circuits","Timing","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance optimization","variable-latency designs","telescopic units","hold logic design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Performance","Logic synthesis","timing analysis","throughput optimization"]}],"publicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 44th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261113/4261114/04261326.pdf","startPage":"976","endPage":"981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Mechanism for Performance Optimization of Variable-Latency Designs","abstract":"In many designs, the worst-case-delay path may never be exercised or may be exercised infrequently. For those designs, a strategy of optimizing a circuit for the worst-case conditions could lead to inefficient resource use. It is possible to improve the throughput of such circuits by introducing variable latency. One of the existing realizations of variable-latency design style is based on telescopic units. The design of the hold logic in telescopic units influences the circuit's throughput. In this paper, we show that the traditionally-designed hold logic in telescopic units may be inaccurate. We make use of the short path activation conditions to obtain more accurate hold logic than that commonly applied in the telescopic units. On average, our approach achieves a performance gain of 25.79% compared to 14.04%, which was reported in the previous works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867084","htmlLink":"/document/4261326/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Mechanism for Performance Optimization of Variable-Latency Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Mechanism for Performance Optimization of Variable-Latency Designs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"DAC-00-212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057544S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261113","isNumber":"4261114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261113","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4261114","articleId":"4261326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261336,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Cheng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37653483600"},{"name":"Jian Gong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Gong","id":"37402748800"},{"name":"Yongning Tang","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Information Systems, De Paul University, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yongning","lastName":"Tang","id":"37308776700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1289-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4261336","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261336","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Computerized monitoring","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Computer science","Intrusion detection","Probability","Educational institutions","Information systems","Spine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic sampling approaches","CERMET backbone network traffic","flow estimator","flow sampling techniques","packet sampling techniques","network flow monitoring","hybrid sampling approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Packet Sampling","Flow Sampling","Hybrid Sampling","Flow Distributions"]}],"abstract":"Online flow distribution monitoring is critical in intrusion detection.

Incremental training based on NC is used in BNCE to train individual NNs for different number of training epochs. The use of NC learning and different training sets for individual NNs generated by boosting reflects emphasis on diversity among individual NNs in an ensemble. BNCE has been tested extensively on several benchmark problems in machine learning and NNs. These are the breast cancer, the credit card, the glass, the letter recognition and the soybean problems. The experimental results show that BNCE can train NN ensembles that have good generalization ability in comparison with other ensemble algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2007.375344","startPage":"68","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261345/4261346/04261367.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2007.375344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Boosting with Negative Correlation Learning for Training Neural Network Ensembles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Neural networks","Diversity reception","Training data","Communications technology","Design methodology","Decorrelation","Benchmark testing","Machine learning","Breast"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation learning","neural network ensembles training","boosting with negative correlation ensemble","incremental training","machine learning","breast cancer","soybean problems","ensemble algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Combining Boosting with Negative Correlation Learning for Training Neural Network Ensembles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737763","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Boosting with Negative Correlation Learning for Training Neural Network Ensembles","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICICT-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045685S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261345","isNumber":"4261346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261345","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4261346","articleId":"4261367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIC, BUET","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4261372,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A method is proposed giving emphasis on the identification of the characters using the proposed methodology. Here generalization is achieved by preprocessing the characters before presenting them to the system for classification. The pre-processing systematically functions isolating the characters from BMP images, as well as noise removal, scaling and binary image conversion. The method uses a flexible matching between sample data and training data components applying Multi-layered Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network. A number of parameters of Neural Network are estimated so that the system performance is improved in comparison with normal training. Classification of character is defined as error minimization among the possible training set. Also, a measure of the amount of distortion for this training is given. Application of Artificial Neural Network in character recognition has made the system faster with optimum performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2007.375350","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2007.375350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261346","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261345/4261346/04261373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Conjunctive Bangla Characters by Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261373/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Conjunctive Bangla Characters by Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261373/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9737792","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Conjunctive Bangla Characters by Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICICT-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049327S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261345","isNumber":"4261346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261345","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4261346","articleId":"4261373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIC, BUET","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4261398,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, the system performance of combined CDMA-SDMA scheme is evaluated under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel for a single sectored cell. A fixed number of available codes L kept in a central pool can be utilized by K users, where, K>L. The same code can be assigned to a group of users according to their angle of arrival (which is known as SDMA group). Here, the analytical model of bit error rate (BER) for any arbitrary number of users has been derived and evaluated. In the second part of this paper, a simple code assignment algorithm is proposed to assign a already used code to a new user by which, the orthogonality between users can be maximized. The results show that the system capacity is noticeably improved with the combined system compared to the pure CDMA system. Further enhancement can be obtained when SDMA grouping is considered with orthogonal code assignment to users those belongs to different SDMA groups. Finally, the code assignment algorithm shows that high number of users can be accommodated by a fixed small number of codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2007.375378","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261345/4261346/04261401.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2007.375378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined CDMA-SDMA Performance Analysis and Code Assignment Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261401/","displayDocTitle":"Combined CDMA-SDMA Performance Analysis and Code Assignment Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737799","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261401/","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined CDMA-SDMA Performance Analysis and Code Assignment Algorithm","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICICT-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04596S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261345","isNumber":"4261346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261345","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4261346","articleId":"4261401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIC, BUETIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261404,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Harun-Owr-Roshid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Harun-Owr-Roshid","id":"38274967500"},{"name":"S.

This includes the popular multi-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technology which allows a straight forward transmission bandwidth enhancement by increasing the number of channels.This, however, will no longer be enough in the near future when the user demands are are more dynamic. In the future, a more flexible optical technology is required. Optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) is highly considered as one of the candidates. The earlier generations of OCDM which was based on direct conversion from electrical to optical domain was complicated and impractical. However the advent of optical spectral amplitude coding (OSAC) scheme with simpler approach has revived the viability of this technology. Khazani-Syed is a new code proposed to overcome the limitations of existing codes at a reduced cost. This paper presents the properties of KS codes, their construction and the performance in comparison with other codes. The advantages of this new code are clearly shown in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2007.375391","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261345/4261346/04261414.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2007.375391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261346","startPage":"266","endPage":"278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Optical Spectral Amplitude Coding Sequence: Khazani-Syed (KS) Code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Optical Spectral Amplitude Coding Sequence: Khazani-Syed (KS) Code","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261414/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"10290003","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Optical Spectral Amplitude Coding Sequence: Khazani-Syed (KS) Code","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICICT-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079392S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261345","isNumber":"4261346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261345","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4261346","articleId":"4261414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIC, BUETIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4261415,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Tsang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Tsang","id":"37373195200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"984-32-3394-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4261415","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Digital signal processing","OFDM","Hardware","Energy consumption","Signal design","Design methodology","CMOS process","System analysis and design","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips","error statistics","hardware description languages","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","DSP processor","OFDM UWB applications","power consumption","signal processor","hardware description language","hardware implemented system","fixed-point digital signal processor","VHDL-AMS","CMOS standard cell library","SYNOPSYS tool","bit error rate","size 0.18 micron"]}],"abstract":"As the digital signal processing hardware system grow in complexity and power consumption, the trend is system design has been to design at higher levels of abstraction. A new design methodology supports the idea of designing at a higher level of specification which implies the functional and quantitative behaviours of the required signal processor and then transforming this into a hardware description language. Such kind of design methodology can reduce the overall design time and estimate the performance of hardware implemented system. In this article, a prototype architecture of fixed-point digital signal processor is modelled using RT-SPA and then be translated into VHDL-AMS, and synthesized using 0.18 mum CMOS standard cell library with a SYNOPSYStrade tool. It enables low bit error rate, low power consumption and small area, as well as can be readily sent for fabrication in a CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2007.375392","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261345/4261346/04261415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2007.375392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261346","startPage":"279","endPage":"282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of DSP Processor for OFDM UWB Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of DSP Processor for OFDM UWB Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261415/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737775","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of DSP Processor for OFDM UWB Applications","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICICT-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050146S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4261345","isNumber":"4261346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261345","xplore-issue":"4261346","articleId":"4261415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIC, BUET","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4261428,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This digest discusses the use of turbo equalization for joint detection and decoding of parity codes that would be used in postprocessing systems. The proposed system has complexity significantly lower than conventional LDPC-turbo equalization systems, and has excellent performance vis-a-vis postprocessing systems. The flexibility of the proposed system is demonstrated by considering an unequal error protection (UEP) code which preferentially places Viterbi algorithm error events within Reed-Solomon symbol boundaries to decrease the sector error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261433/4261434/04261736.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"303","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2006.375885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2006.375885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Equalization as a Postprocessor for Partial-Response Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes","Error correction codes","Error analysis","Perpendicular magnetic recording","Iterative decoding","Viterbi algorithm","AWGN","Gain","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error correction codes","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes","turbo codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization","post-Viterbi processors","partial-response channel detection","weak parity codes","low-density parity check codes","joint detection","postprocessing systems","unequal error protection code","Viterbi algorithm error events","Reed-Solomon symbol boundaries","sector error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Equalization as a Postprocessor for Partial-Response Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4261736/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9740011","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"8-12 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Equalization as a Postprocessor for Partial-Response Channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"INTMAG-00-302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034726S","chronDate":"8-12 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4261433","isNumber":"4261434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261433","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4261434","articleId":"4261736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intermag ConferenceIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4261831,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This is the first reported magneto-optic switch for optical fiber networks. Light does not exit from the fiber except when propagating into the MO rotator, thus this is an all fiber switch. The extinction ratio was stabilized and faster switching was observed when the domain walls are pinned and only rotation occurred. Integrated magnetooptics is the final frontier for the improvement of the device characteristics as well as the commercialization of such a magneto-optic switch. Finally the issues of implementation and operation of the integrated magneto-optical switch and the techniques of growing high quality garnet thin films for this purpose are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376180","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261433/4261434/04261889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261434","startPage":"456","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magneto-optic based fiber switch for optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4261889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Magneto-optic based fiber switch for optical communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4261889/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 May 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9740072","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4261889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magneto-optic based fiber switch for optical communications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"INTMAG-00-455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051028S","chronDate":"8-12 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4261433","isNumber":"4261434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261433","xplore-issue":"4261434","articleId":"4261889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intermag ConferenceIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4262002,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Using this system, single bits of data are stored within lithographically defined islands, which are both uniform and discrete in nature, and which enclose a single domain. A combination of the Pseudo Vector Diffraction (PVD) equation and a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method solution of Maxwell's equations is used to simulate the signals detected at the system output. Due to computational restrictions, the experimentally measured refractive index of the entire Co/Pt stack was utilized instead of the refractive indices of the individual layers.The signals demonstrate that the phase responses of the islands themselves dominate the response contributed by the magnetization state, since the expected polarity reversal between the up and down magnetized states is not observed. The difference in magnitude between the recorded states is very small but is still detectable, and the unmagnetized response lays halfway between.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261433/4261434/04262002.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"569","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4262002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Readout Analysis of a Near-Field Patterned Media Magneto-Optical Recording System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Pattern analysis","Magnetic analysis","Magnetooptic recording","Maxwell equations","Magnetic recording","Diffraction","Atherosclerosis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","magnetic recording","magnetisation","magneto-optical recording","Maxwell equations","refractive index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain method","near-field patterned media","magneto-optical recording system","high density magnetic recording","inherent domain confinement properties","pseudo vector diffraction equation","Maxwells equations","refractive index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4262002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Readout Analysis of a Near-Field Patterned Media Magneto-Optical Recording System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4262002/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9724286","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"8-12 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Readout Analysis of a Near-Field Patterned Media Magneto-Optical Recording System","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"INTMAG-00-568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030738S","chronDate":"8-12 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4261433","isNumber":"4261434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261433","xplore-issue":"4261434","articleId":"4262002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEIntermag Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4262100,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

By controlling the etched profile at the time of the 1st IBE step, formation of the redeposition layer is prevented and the write operation region of the MTJ array is improved.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2006.376460","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4261433/4261434/04262169.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4261434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ion-beam-etched profile control of MTJ cells for improving the switching characteristics of high-density MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4262169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ion-beam-etched profile control of MTJ cells for improving the switching characteristics of high-density MRAM","conferenceDate":"8-12 May 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9740175","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4262169/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ion-beam-etched profile control of MTJ cells for improving the switching characteristics of high-density MRAM","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"INTMAG-00-735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034885S","chronDate":"8-12 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4261433","isNumber":"4261434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4261433","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4261434","articleId":"4262169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intermag ConferenceIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4262225,"authors":[{"name":"X.

It is a well known result that network coding may achieve better network throughput in certain multicast topologies; however, the practicality of network coding has been questioned, due to its high computational complexity. This paper represents the first attempt towards a high performance implementation of network coding. We first propose to implement progressive decoding with Gauss-Jordan elimination, such that blocks can be decoded as they are received. We then employ hardware acceleration with SSE2 and AltiVec SIMD vector instructions on x86 and PowerPC processors, respectively. We then use a careful threading design to take advantage of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems and multi-core processors. The objective of this work is to explore the computational limits of network coding in off-the-shelf modern processors, and to provide a solid reference implementation to facilitate commercial deployment of network coding. Our high-performance implementation is packaged as a C++ class library, and runs in Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, in Intel, AMD and IBM PowerPC processor families.

Typical applications include the detection of the transportation front line of some vegetation or animalcule's growth over a certain geographical region. We propose and analyze two novel algorithms for outlying sensor identification and event boundary detection. These algorithms are purely localized and, thus, scale well to large sensor networks. Their computational overhead is low, since only simple numerical operations are involved. Simulation results indicate that these algorithms can clearly detect the event boundary and can identify outlying sensors with a high accuracy and a low false alarm rate when as many as 20 percent sensors report outlying readings. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithms can accept any kind of scalar values as inputs-a dramatic improvement over existing work, which takes only 0/1 decision predicates. Therefore, our algorithms are generic. They can be applied as long as \"events\" can be modeled by numerical numbers. Though designed for sensor networks, our algorithms can be applied to the outlier detection and regional data analysis in spatial data mining.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor phenomena and characterization","Event detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Vegetation","Face detection","Transportation","Computational modeling","Discrete event simulation","Biological system modeling","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor networks","event boundary detection","outlying sensor identification","ROC curve analysis."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.1067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4262529/04262542.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.1067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized Outlying and Boundary Data Detection in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4262542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localized Outlying and Boundary Data Detection in Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4262542/","volume":"19","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4262542/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized Outlying and Boundary Data Detection in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"k1145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077317S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4262529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4262529","articleId":"4262542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4262597,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Elenius","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Elenius","id":"37399370900"},{"name":"Grit Denker","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Grit","lastName":"Denker","id":"37325876100"},{"name":"Mark-Oliver Stehr","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark-Oliver","lastName":"Stehr","id":"37332768600"},{"name":"Rukman Senanayake","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rukman","lastName":"Senanayake","id":"37700667100"},{"name":"Carolyn Talcott","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Carolyn","lastName":"Talcott","id":"37299490300"},{"name":"David Wilkins","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Wilkins","id":"38180957800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2767-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4262597","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Radio spectrum management","Cognitive radio","Wireless communication","Delay","Runtime","Regulators","Microprogramming","Radio control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CoRaL","policy language","reasoning techniques","spectrum policies","cognitive radio language","share spectrum","radio transmissions","spectrum sharing opportunities"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CoRaL--Policy Language and Reasoning Techniques for Spectrum Policies","doi":"10.1109/POLICY.2007.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262557","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4262556/4262557/04262597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POLICY.2007.13","startPage":"261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4262597","abstract":"We present the cognitive radio (policy) language (CoRaL), a new language for expressing policies that govern the behavior of cognitive radios that opportunistically share spectrum.

Biological neurons need more energy to transmit a \"spike\" than not to transmit one, and hence the energy complexity of a threshold circuit is defined as the number of gates in the circuit that output \"1\" during computation. Since the firing activity of neurons in the brain is quite sparse, the following question arises: what Boolean functions can or cannot be computed by threshold circuits with small energy complexity. In the paper, we partially answer the question, that is, we show that there exists a tradeoff among three complexity measures of threshold circuits: the energy complexity, size, and depth. The tradeoff implies an exponential lower bound on the size of constant-depth threshold circuits with small energy complexity for a large class of Boolean functions.","doi":"10.1109/CCC.2007.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4262736/4262737/04262761.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCC.2007.4","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'07)","startPage":"169","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Exponential Lower Bound on the Size of Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits with Small Energy Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4262761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Exponential Lower Bound on the Size of Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits with Small Energy Complexity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4262761/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4262761/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9850111","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-16 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Exponential Lower Bound on the Size of Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits with Small Energy Complexity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"27800169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072244S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4262736","isNumber":"4262737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4262736","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4262737","articleId":"4262761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4262799,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Xu","affiliation":["Mobile Systems Lab, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37690440500"},{"name":"Rajive Bagrodia","affiliation":["Mobile Systems Lab, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Rajive","lastName":"Bagrodia","id":"37269537000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2898-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-4097"}],"articleNumber":"4262799","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"abstract":"High-fidelity simulations of mixed wired and wireless network systems are dependent on detailed simulation models, especially in the lower layers of the network stack. However, detailed modeling can result in prohibitive computation cost. In recent years, commercial graphics cards (GPUs) have drawn attention from the general computing community due to the superior computation capability. In this paper, we present our experience with using commercial graphics cards to speed up execution of network simulation models. First, we propose a general simulation framework supporting GPU-accelerated simulation models. Software abstraction is designed to facilitate the use and development of GPU-based models. Second, we implement and evaluate two simulation models using GPUs. We observed that using the GPUs can yield significant performance improvements for large configurations of the model, as compared with pure CPU-based computations, with no degradation in the accuracy of the results. This benefit is particularly impressive for models that include significant data parallel computations. However, we also observed that the overhead introduced by GPUs make them less effective in improving execution time of other network models. This study suggests that besides parallel computing and grid computing, network simulations can also be scaled by reaping computation capability of GPUs and, potentially, other external computational hardware.","displayPublicationTitle":"21st International Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation (PADS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4262777/4262778/04262799.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"21st International Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation (PADS'07)","doi":"10.1109/PADS.2007.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PADS.2007.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4262799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Evaluation Platform for High Fidelity Network Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Concurrent computing","Grid computing","Graphics","Computer networks","Wireless networks","Computational efficiency","Software design","Degradation","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer peripheral equipment","Hi-Fi equipment","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated evaluation platform","high fidelity network modeling","wireless network systems","commercial graphics cards","Software abstraction","parallel computing","grid computing","network simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4262799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Evaluation Platform for High Fidelity Network Modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4262799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9830422","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated Evaluation Platform for High Fidelity Network Modeling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28980131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067348S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4262777","isNumber":"4262778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4262777","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4262778","articleId":"4262799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4262804,"authors":[{"name":"Andriy Naborskyy","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Andriy","lastName":"Naborskyy","id":"37698238000"},{"name":"Richard M.

It is shown that an equivalent to Sabine's equation for reverberation time in a room is valid for the completely diffused field, depending only on the volume, the surface area, and an effective absorption coefficient. An exponential decay of the power as a function of the delay is a consequence of the assumptions. Furthermore, the concept of a reverberation distance is also valid. This is the distance from a transmitting antenna where the received diffuse, randomly scattered power equals the direct line-of-sight received power, such that the diffuse power dominates for distances larger than the reverberation distance. A number of measurements in a large room support the theory with an effective absorption coefficient of 0.5. The power delay profiles around the room from a transmitter in the ceiling vary only in the first arriving part of the impulse, whereas the tail, being dominated by the diffuse field, has the same power level for a given delay and the same decay rate all over the room. It is also a consequence of the theory that the diffuse fields incident on an antenna are uniformly distributed in angle.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2007.376642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4262847/04263141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2007.376642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262847","startPage":"27","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Room electromagnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Room electromagnetics","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9612616","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4263141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Room electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"492007-J-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099236S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4262847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4262847","articleId":"4263141","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4263182,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The method takes into account the electromagnetic field at the receiving antenna due to first- and higher-order propagation mechanisms. Emphasis is given on the computation of the scattered near or Fresnel-zone field using numerical techniques, since in a typical urban environment, the scattered near or Fresnel-zone field occupies a large percentage of the area under investigation. The high resolution radio-coverage plots are computed by complex vector addition of all of the received signals for several values of the channel parameters. Finally, a comparison of the radio-coverage results obtained through this method with the corresponding results based on different electromagnetic methods and measurements, previously published in the literature, is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A radio-coverage prediction model in wireless communication systems based on physical optics and the physical theory of diffraction [Wireless Corner]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2007.376622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4262847/04263182.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2007.376622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"A radio-coverage prediction model in wireless communication systems based on physical optics and the physical theory of diffraction [Wireless Corner]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4263182/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9611756","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A radio-coverage prediction model in wireless communication systems based on physical optics and the physical theory of diffraction [Wireless Corner]","sourcePdf":"492007-E-52.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06916S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4262847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4262847","articleId":"4263182","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4263185,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It will be shown that the complexity of retrieval procedures is a function not only of the independency of different sets of measurements, but also of the characteristics of the antenna under test (AUT). Antenna-pattern features, such as its beam direction, will have a profound effect on the success of phase-reconstruction algorithms. The failure of a well-known phase-retrieval method, the iterative Fourier technique, is investigated for a case where the antenna has a scanned beam. It is found that this is due to a less-than-optimum choice of the initial guess. To alleviate the deficiency of the iterative Fourier technique, a simple but effective initial guess is sought by the use of the differential evolutionary algorithm. This global search technique tries to find the best initial phase guess that minimizes an error criterion. Subsequently, this best guess is fed to the iterative Fourier phase-retrieval routine for further phase refinements. Having done this, the far-field can subsequently be constructed. The improvement in the phase-reconstruction algorithm is examined through a series of simulations and measurements.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2007.376625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4262847/04263185.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2007.376625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4262847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new look at phaseless planar near-field measurements: limitations, simulations, measurements, and a hybrid solution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263185/","displayDocTitle":"A new look at phaseless planar near-field measurements: limitations, simulations, measurements, and a hybrid solution","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9621357","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263185/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new look at phaseless planar near-field measurements: limitations, simulations, measurements, and a hybrid solution","sourcePdf":"492007-S-55.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088071S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4262847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4262847","articleId":"4263185","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263187,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This work presents different pseudo 2D HMM structures for a face recognition showing performances reasonably fast for binary image. The proposed P2-D HMMs are made up of five levels of states, one for each region of interest (Rol) in which the input frontal images are sequenced: forehead, eyes, nose, mouth and chin. Each of P2-D HMMs has been trained by coefficients of an artificial neural network used to compress a bitmap image in order to represent it with a number of coefficients that is smaller than the total number of pixels. All the P2-D HMMs, applied to the validation set consisting of the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) face database, have achieved good rates of recognition compared to other methods proposed in the literature and, in particular, the structure 3-6-6-6-3 has achieved a rate of recognition equal to 100%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Identification Advanced

Most biometric features (such as fingerprints, hand shape, iris or retinal scans) require cooperative subjects in close proximity to the biometric system. Even top 2D face recognition systems today are only reliable at a distance when presented with frontal images. Our approach is accomplished by processing images acquired with an ultra-high resolution video camera, inferring the location of the subjects' head, using this information to crop the region of interest, building a 3D face model, and using this 3D model to perform biometric identification. To build the 3D model, we use an image sequence, as natural head and body motion provides enough viewpoint variation to perform stereo-motion for 3D face reconstruction. The 3D face model allows the use of true shape invariants for recognition against 3D galleries. Also the 3D model can assist in matching non-frontal faces against 2D galleries by rotating and rendering the 3D reconstruction into a 2D frontal image when only a 2D gallery is available. This approach constitutes a considerable step forward in solving the challenging problem of biometric identification at a distance.","doi":"10.1109/AUTOID.2007.380603","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Identification Advanced Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Identification Advanced Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263198/4263199/04263224.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTOID.2007.380603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Non-Cooperative Individuals at a Distance with 3D Face Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263224/","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Non-Cooperative Individuals at a Distance with 3D Face Modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9833573","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263224/","conferenceDate":"7-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Non-Cooperative Individuals at a Distance with 3D Face Modeling","confLoc":"Alghero, Italy","sourcePdf":"AUTOID-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086555S","chronDate":"7-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263198","isNumber":"4263199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263198","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4263199","articleId":"4263224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263234,"authors":[{"name":"Jongsun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Biometrics Engineering Research Center (BERC), Yonsei University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongsun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37697311000"},{"name":"Chulhan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Biometrics Engineering Research Center (BERC), Yonsei University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chulhan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37423026600"},{"name":"Jaihie Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Biometrics Engineering Research Center (BERC), Yonsei University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaihie","lastName":"Kim","id":"37337252800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1299-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1300-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263234","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Face recognition","Bioinformatics","Kernel","Filters","Data engineering","Fingerprint recognition","Data privacy","Degradation","Random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","feature extraction","image representation","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["changeable biometric system","parts-based localized representation","face recognition","biometric data","local nonnegative matrix factorization","feature vector extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","changeable biometrics","LNMF","parts-based localized representation"]}],"abstract":"Biometric data cannot be changed or canceled if they are compromised. To cope with this problem, changeable biometric systems that use transformed biometric data instead of original data have recently been introduced. In this paper, we propose a changeable biometric system for face recognition that uses LNMF (local non-negative matrix factorization), or parts-based localized representation. Two different sets of LNMF bases can be computed from given training images when training them twice and two different LNMF feature vectors can then be extracted from an input face image using these LNMF bases. The two feature vectors are scrambled randomly and a new transformed feature vector can be generated by the addition of the two feature vectors. The scrambling rule is determined by a given user's PIN, and when the transformed feature vector is compromised, it is replaced by using a new scrambling rule. Because the transformed template is generated by the addition of two vectors, the two different original LNMF feature vectors cannot be recovered from the transformed feature vector. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the PCA and original LNMF-based methods. Also the transformed feature vector satisfies the requirement of changeability.","doi":"10.1109/AUTOID.2007.380613","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Identification Advanced Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Identification Advanced Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263198/4263199/04263234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTOID.2007.380613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263199","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Changeable Biometric System That Uses Parts-Based Localized Representation for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Changeable Biometric System That Uses Parts-Based Localized Representation for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263234/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9810101","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4263234/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Changeable Biometric System That Uses Parts-Based Localized Representation for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Alghero, Italy","sourcePdf":"AUTOID-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084001S","chronDate":"7-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263198","isNumber":"4263199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263198","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4263199","articleId":"4263234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263291,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Pittet","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectronique Nanotechnologie et Capteurs, (LENA-EA 3730), Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Pittet","id":"37395218600"},{"name":"Guo-Neng Lu","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectronique Nanotechnologie et Capteurs, (LENA-EA 3730), Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Guo-Neng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37399976100"},{"name":"Laurent Quiquerez","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectronique Nanotechnologie et Capteurs, (LENA-EA 3730), Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Quiquerez","id":"37426967900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0394-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263291","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Voltage","Circuit noise","Analytical models","Instruments","Capacitive sensors","Frequency domain analysis","Circuit simulation","Signal to noise ratio","Photodetectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise modeling","charge amplification","charge sampling","cyclostationarity-based analytical model","charge amplifier","correlated double sampling circuit","power spectral density","squared voltage","model validation","temporal noise simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263291","abstract":"A new cyclostationarity-based analytical model for noise analysis of a charge amplifier followed by a correlated double sampling (CDS) circuit is proposed.

In this study, a novel demodulator architecture is proposed. It is based on a simple self-sampling scheme which is a truly low-cost high-efficiency implementation and has excellent ability to work on a very small difference (0.15 V) between the two modulated levels, which represent the binary '0' and '1' separately. The results show the presented type can be designed to fit the operation carrier for the special need and has a quite area efficiency than the ever published similar works due to its existent digital benefit.

New capacitor sizing rules for splitting the capacitor of cascode compensation into two capacitors for the implementation of hybrid-cascode compensation is also proposed to make the compensation scheme more efficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Guidelines","Operational amplifiers","Capacitors","Transfer functions","Frequency","Design methodology","Poles and zeros","Circuits","Damping","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","circuit stability","compensation","network synthesis","operational amplifiers","poles and zeros","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage cascode-compensated operational amplifiers design","design methodology","open-loop circuit-level parameters","closed-loop stability","open-loop transfer function","zeros effect","capacitor sizing rules","capacitor splitting","hybrid-cascode compensation scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379776","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263354.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Guidelines for Two-Stage Cascode-Compensated Operational Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design Guidelines for Two-Stage Cascode-Compensated Operational Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263354/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263354/","accessionNumber":"9708424","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Guidelines for Two-Stage Cascode-Compensated Operational Amplifiers","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045047S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4263366,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Belenky","affiliation":["The VLSI Systems Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Belenky","id":"38276353100"},{"name":"Alexander Fish","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Fish","id":"37268457100"},{"name":"Orly Yadid-Pecht","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Canada","The VLSI Systems Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Orly","lastName":"Yadid-Pecht","id":"38298354100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0394-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263366","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":303},"abstract":"A novel concept for global shutter CMOS image sensors with Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) implementation is presented. The proposed imager is based on the multi sampling WDR approach and it allows an efficient global shutter pixel implementation achieving small pixel size and high fill factor. The proposed imager provides wide DR by applying adaptive exposure time to each pixel, according to the local illumination intensity level. Two pixel configurations, employing different kinds of 1-bit in-pixel memory were implemented. An imager, including all proposed pixels was designed and simulated in a mixed-signal 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology. While operating at 1.8V voltage supply the proposed sensors achieve the DR up to 120dB. System architecture and operation are discussed and simulation results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263366.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Shutter CMOS Image Sensor With Wide Dynamic Range","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","dynamic range","global shutter pixel implementation","fill factor","adaptive exposure time","illumination intensity level","mixed-signal CMOS technology","active pixel sensors","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.8 V","word length 1 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Global Shutter CMOS Image Sensor With Wide Dynamic Range","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263366/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9718547","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Shutter CMOS Image Sensor With Wide Dynamic Range","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081274S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263367,"authors":[{"name":"Shahram Mohammad Nejad","affiliation":["Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Optoelectronic and Laser Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahram Mohammad","lastName":"Nejad","id":"38191679000"},{"name":"Maryam Pourmahyabadi","affiliation":["Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Optoelectronic and Laser Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Pourmahyabadi","id":"37688111700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0394-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser modes","Ring lasers","Inertial navigation","Frequency","Temperature sensors","Laser theory","Testing","Laser mode locking","Sensor systems","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyroscopes","inertial navigation","measurement by laser beam","ring lasers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ring laser gyro","inertial navigation","dynamic modeling","statistical model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263367","abstract":"In this paper, the performance of a Ring Laser Gyro based inertial navigation is studied.

Based on the simulation platform, we have demonstrated several design styles including short wire, wire segmentation, and 3-wire, 3-phase systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Large scale integration","Wire","Cryptography","Logic","Antenna measurements","Very large scale integration","Analytical models","Pattern analysis","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tamper resistivity analysis","nanometer LSI","process variations","differential electromagnetic analysis","wave dynamic differential logic","short wire","wire segmentation","three-phase systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379806","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263384.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tamper Resistivity Analysis for Nano-meter LSI with Process Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tamper Resistivity Analysis for Nano-meter LSI with Process Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263384/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263384/","accessionNumber":"9703441","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tamper Resistivity Analysis for Nano-meter LSI with Process Variations","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039838S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4263395,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Acar","firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Acar","id":"37283839200"},{"name":"Anne Johan Annema","firstName":"Anne Johan","lastName":"Annema","id":"37272913300"},{"name":"Bram Nauta","firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Nauta","id":"37274378900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0394-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263395","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":873},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Power amplifiers","Switches","Inductance","High power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Capacitance","Zero voltage switching","Power generation","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized analytical design equations","variable slope class E power amplifier","switching RF power amplifiers","analytical design equations","frequency 40 GHz"]}],"abstract":"The Class-E power amplifier is widely used because of its high efficiency, resulting from switching at zero voltage and zero slope of the switch voltage.

To limit the propagation error that is a major drawback of conventional motion compensated methods, motion estimation is performed using original lines only, for same and opposite parity fields. In addition, a threshold value is used during the search to recognize situations where the motion estimator fails to find an optimal matching block. Enhanced edge-based line average with median filtering is used in these situations.

The first two adders compare favorably against other competing adders in terms of simplicity of design and hardware used. Even though the third one uses more transistors in its implementation, it is faster than the fastest RBA cell reported in the literature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","CMOS logic circuits","Logic gates","Encoding","Chip scale packaging","Delay effects","Application software","Digital arithmetic","Hardware","Electronic equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","delays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundant binary adders","arithmetic circuits","constant time addition property","4:2 compressor","CMOS logic gates","transmission gates","RBA cell","delay optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263416","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379838","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379838","startPage":"514","endPage":"517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Optimized Redundant Binary Adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay Optimized Redundant Binary Adders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263416/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263416/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703467","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Optimized Redundant Binary Adders","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037896S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4263420,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Performance-optimized IEEE floating-point implementations can be particularly hard verification cases for their size and their irregularities, for the redundancy that is often used in the representations of intermediate values, and by the complex non-standard logic optimizations that are incorporated in the designs. We formally verify the highly optimized Even-Seidel rounding algorithm for IEEE floating-point multiplication and IEEE floating-point addition which incorporates the use of rounding injections. Our verification efforts are based on the PVS theorem-prover. We structure the whole verification process in a hierarchical fashion where existing specifications and properties are re-used to ease the overall effort.

Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs), in which multiple ADCs are combined, are an effective way to achieve high sampling rates in order to comply with modern telecommunication standards. The drawback of such TI-ADCs are additional errors that are due to mismatches among the channels, which degrade the overall performance. Several qualified methods have been proposed to compensate offset, static gain, and timing (or linear-phase) mismatches. However, an effective method to compensate frequency-dependent magnitude response mismatches is still missing. In this paper we consider the compensation of frequency-dependent magnitude response mismatches for a two-channel time-interleaved sampling system. A single linear-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filter cascaded by a single time-varying multiplier provides the magnitude response compensation so that the performance of a TI-ADC is no longer limited by linear channel mismatches.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379888","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263466.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compensation Method for Magnitude Response Mismatches in Two-channel Time-interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263466/","displayDocTitle":"A Compensation Method for Magnitude Response Mismatches in Two-channel Time-interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263466/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compensation Method for Magnitude Response Mismatches in Two-channel Time-interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069035S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263479,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Yachide","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Yachide","id":"37563594400"},{"name":"Makoto Ikeda","affiliation":["VLSI Design and Education Center, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37273902900"},{"name":"Kunihiro Asada","affiliation":["Tokyo Daigaku, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Kunihiro","lastName":"Asada","id":"37273906700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0394-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4263479","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Field programmable gate arrays","Engines","Cameras","Intelligent sensors","Data acquisition","Data processing","Timing","Design engineering","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","distance measurement","field programmable gate arrays","intelligent sensors","measurement systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed 3D measurement system","FPGA based 3D engine","field programmable gate arrays","range finder","smart CMOS image sensor","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor","system controller","3D geometry calculation","calibration parameter","3D range-finding rate","multiple viewpoint 3D measurement"]}],"abstract":"We realize a high-speed 3-D measurement system consists of a range-finder based on a smart CMOS image sensor and a system-controller with 3-D calculation capability based on an FPGA.

The digital circuitry is in charge of PCM to PWM conversion and feed forward correction of non-linearity and non-ideality of the modulation scheme and of the switching power output stage. A new digital modulator combining oversampling, noise shaping and cross-point estimation is proposed to reduce the audio signal distortion below a HI-FI target level of -54 dB. The complexity and power cost of the digital circuitry are kept as low as possible to make direct digital amplifiers competitive in the consumer market scenario and to maintain the high power efficiency of the switching approach. The final architecture is implemented by logic synthesis of the digital processing part in FPGA while off-chip components are used for the power output stage.

Furthermore, the drive towards integration with deep submicron CMOS process aggravates the difficulties in high frequency mixed signal circuit design. This paper first summarises the challenges in system and circuit facing GHz IF complex sampling. It then proposes a charge sampling receiver architecture which combines MEMS filter and complex FIR sampling filter in order to achieve high IF digitization suitable for multi-standard cellular applications. The architecture is validated through system behavioural models emulating deep submicron MOS characteristics. It can be shown that with existing MEMS filter technology and advanced standard CMOS process, it is possible to realise a reconfigurable high IF SDR receiver.

This image sensor uses global shutter pixel architecture in order to avoid distortion in imaging fast moving objects. To limit shutter leakage, a new PMOS pixel architecture is implemented. The high dynamic range is reach through a logarithmic architecture pixel. An on-chip calibration method is implemented to reduce the FPN caused by process variations, weakness of this architecture. The basic principle is the calibration of each pixel against an in-pixel reference current in place of the normal diode photocurrent. Two pixel levels corresponding to the photocurrent and a known reference current become available for every pixel. Then a double sampling technique allows to remove offsets due to threshold voltage variations. An innovation of this work consists in the implementation of the current calibration source inside the pixel.

This work presents a novel design methodology of dual-input single-output fuzzy logic controllers in search of a cost-effective solution. For this, instead of synthesizing the classical three-stage fuzzification, rule inference and defuzzification units, a further stage is added inspired in modeling the resultant control surface: the whole nonlinear area is split in specific rectangular sectors and each of them is approximated by a second-order polynomial function. In this way, the hardware-software co-design of the fuzzy controller is reduced to a computer that for each input point (x,y) calculates its output z=f(x,y) according to the surface model of the particular sector that encloses this input point. The physical implementation of the fuzzy controller is based on a MCU-FPGA platform where the control surface is segmented, parameterized, stored through initialized SRAM memory and appended to the design bitstream as a simple and customizable data file. Moreover, the dynamically reconfigurable FPGA makes feasible to multiplex the silicon-based functionality at run-time while the sequential execution of the fuzzy algorithm is in progress.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2006.379683","publicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263277/4263278/04263595.pdf","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1231","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2006.379683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Software Co-design of a Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Fuzzy Logic Controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Software Co-design of a Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Fuzzy Logic Controller","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4263595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9718629","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Software Co-design of a Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Fuzzy Logic Controller","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.188216S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4263277","isNumber":"4263278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263277","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4263278","articleId":"4263595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263607,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Minghua","lastName":"Shi","id":"37416104800"},{"name":"A.

A t-EC w-bit parallel BCH ECC code was designed for correcting the random bit errors of the flash memory chip, which is suitable for the randomly bit errors property and parallel I/O interface of the NAND type Flash memory. A Code-Banking mechanism was designed for the trade-offs between the controller cost and the ISP (in system programmability) support. With the ISP functionality and the Flash Parameters programmed in the reserved area of the Flash Memory chip during the card production stage, the function for supporting various kinds of NAND Flash memory could be provided by a single controller. In addition, built-in defect management and wear-leveling algorithm enhanced the product life cycle and reliability.

Electroplating of Rh is shown to have similar to Cu superconformal filling capability, allowing us to successfully fill high aspect ratio vias (40nm \u00d7 240nm). Plating of 300 mm wafers with 60nm \u00d7 290nm vias was demonstrated using CVD or ALD ruthenium (Ru) as the seed layer. An annealing process was developed to obtain a thin Rh film resistivity of 6.5 &3x003BC;\u03a9-cm, which is 1.5 to 3X lower than the resistivity of CVD W films. Since Rh is stable in Si environment, when compared to a fast diffusing Cu, a very thin Ti/Ru layer can be implemented. Therefore we propose to use PVD Ti/ALD Ru/electroplated Rh as the alternative MOL metallurgy. With this simple liner/seed/fill stack, the overall MOL resistance is calculated to be 2x lower than the overall MOL resistance of the conventional W stacks, and slightly lower than Cu fill stacks. In addition, the ability to use a thinner liner layer than that used for Cu-base fill process, provides a greater potential for extendibility of Rh fill into future CMOS MOL generations.","doi":"10.1109/IITC.2007.382360","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conferencee","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conferencee","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263633/4263634/04263672.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITC.2007.382360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative low resistance MOL technology with electroplated rhodium as contact plugs for 32nm CMOS and beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An alternative low resistance MOL technology with electroplated rhodium as contact plugs for 32nm CMOS and beyond","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866864","htmlLink":"/document/4263672/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative low resistance MOL technology with electroplated rhodium as contact plugs for 32nm CMOS and beyond","confLoc":"Burlingame, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IITC-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055981S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263633","isNumber":"4263634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263633","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4263634","articleId":"4263672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263702,"authors":[{"name":"Mizuhisa Nihei","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Mizuhisa","lastName":"Nihei","id":"38549252900"},{"name":"Takashi Hyakushima","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Hyakushima","id":"37658596700"},{"name":"Shintaro Sato","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Sato","id":"37593406000"},{"name":"Tatsuhiro Nozue","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuhiro","lastName":"Nozue","id":"37658595400"},{"name":"Masaaki Norimatsu","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Norimatsu","id":"37650075900"},{"name":"Miho Mishima","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Miho","lastName":"Mishima","id":"37702972300"},{"name":"Tomo Murakami","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomo","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37689530000"},{"name":"Daiyu Kondo","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Daiyu","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37664318100"},{"name":"Akio Kawabata","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Kawabata","id":"37284474600"},{"name":"Mari Ohfuti","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Ohfuti","id":"37658638400"},{"name":"Yuji Awano","affiliation":["MIRAI-Selete, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Awano","id":"37284475300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1069-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1070-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-632X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6338"}],"articleNumber":"4263702","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes","Ballistic transport","Electric resistance","Filling","Dielectric substrates","Temperature","Wiring","Tin","Lead compounds","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","electron mean free path","optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical properties","carbon nanotube","Damascene process","interconnection fabrication","electron mean free path"]}],"abstract":"We studied the electrical properties of a carbon nanotube (CNT) via interconnect fabricated by a novel damascene process which is mostly compatible with conventional Cu interconnects. It was found that the resistance of 60-nm-height vias was independent of temperatures as high as 423 K, which suggests that the carrier transport is ballistic. The obtained resistance of 0.05\u03a9 for 2.8-\u03bcm-diameter vias is the lowest value ever reported. From the via height dependence of the resistance, the electron mean free path was estimated to be about 80 nm, which is similar to the via height predicted for 32-nm technology node (year 2013). This indicates that it will be possible to realize CNT vias with ballistic transport for 32-nm technology node and below.","doi":"10.1109/IITC.2007.382390","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conferencee","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conferencee","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263633/4263634/04263702.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITC.2007.382390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanotube Via Interconnects Fabricated by Novel Damascene Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263702/","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanotube Via Interconnects Fabricated by Novel Damascene Process","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9866894","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263702/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanotube Via Interconnects Fabricated by Novel Damascene Process","confLoc":"Burlingame, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IITC-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048719S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263633","isNumber":"4263634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263633","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4263634","articleId":"4263702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4263704,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Leduc","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Leduc","id":"37265370400"},{"name":"Francois de Crecy","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"de Crecy","id":"37297622100"},{"name":"Murielle Fayolle","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Murielle","lastName":"Fayolle","id":"37265376100"},{"name":"Barbara Charlet","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Charlet","id":"37354489000"},{"name":"Thierry Enot","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Enot","id":"37687896600"},{"name":"Marc Zussy","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Zussy","id":"37352181400"},{"name":"Bob Jones","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Austin Silicon Technology Solutions, Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Jones","id":"37690423700"},{"name":"Jean-Charles Barbe","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Barbe","id":"37088618618"},{"name":"Nelly Kernevez","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Nelly","lastName":"Kernevez","id":"37413114700"},{"name":"Nicolas Sillon","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Sillon","id":"37401787400"},{"name":"Sylvain Maitrejean","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Maitrejean","id":"37268132300"},{"name":"Didier Louis","affiliation":["CEA L\u00e9ti, MINATEC, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Louis","id":"37325364500"},{"name":"Gerard Passemard","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Passemard","id":"37284551600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1069-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1070-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-632X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6338"}],"articleNumber":"4263704","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1543},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Quality management","Wafer bonding","Temperature","Thermal resistance","Silicon","Stacking","Integrated circuit interconnections","Dielectric substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","silicon compounds","thermal management (packaging)","thermal resistance","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wafer-to wafer two-stratum 3D IC integration","thermal management","hydrophilic bonding","process optimization","thermal resistance","SiO2-SiO2"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, two main challenges for wafer-to wafer 3D integration are investigated: bonding quality (including wafer-to-wafer alignment) and thermal management.

A realized four-stage ABTL low-noise amplifier circuit exhibited a small-signal gain of more than 18 dB between 216 and 238 GHz, while a four-stage coplanar LNA MMIC achieved a linear gain of 15 dB at 225 GHz and more than 12 dB over the bandwidth from 217 to 245 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380443","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263820.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metamorphic H-Band Low-Noise Amplifier MMICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263820/","displayDocTitle":"Metamorphic H-Band Low-Noise Amplifier MMICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727562","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263820/","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamorphic H-Band Low-Noise Amplifier MMICs","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121592S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4263820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263823,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hao Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656961800"},{"name":"John Whalen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Whalen","id":"37701301900"},{"name":"Dimitrios Peroulis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Peroulis","id":"37275343300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0687-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0688-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"4263823","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":893},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microswitches","Switches","Coplanar waveguides","Radio frequency","Circuits","Transmission line measurements","Wideband","Micromechanical devices","Impedance","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","liquid metals","microswitches","microwave switches","millimetre wave devices","UHF devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liquid metal MEMS switch","coplanar waveguide line","shunt switch","wide-band capacitive switch","Galinstan","micro-channel","impedance","RF short circuit","frequency 2 GHz to 100 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF","liquid metal","Galinstan","MEMS","shunt switch"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the first wide-band MEMS capacitive switch using non-toxic liquid metal, Galinstan, is reported. Controlled movement of Galinstan in a micro-channel alters the impedance of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) line from 50\u03a9 (off-state) to an effective RF short circuit (on-state). The RF short circuit in particular is achieved when a slug of Galinstan capacitively connects the center conductor with the ground planes of the CPW line. Galinstan is reliably manipulated by surrounding it with Teflon solution. Because of Teflon, no residual liquid metal is observed when Galinstan moves. In addition, the Teflon solution has insignificant RF loss and therefore does not adversely affect the switch loss in its off-state even up to 100GHz. The insertion loss of the switch is measured at 0.2, 0.7 and 1.3dB at 20, 40 and 100GHz respectively and is mainly due to the 1500\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03bc</i>\nm long transmission line.

This platform consists of broadband coplanar waveguide transmission lines with integrated microfluidic channels for characterizing the dielectric properties of submicroliter fluid samples. On-wafer calibration techniques are used to obtain the S-parameters of the composite structure (transmission line and microfluid channel) up to 40 GHz. Using microwave network analysis theory, we isolated the response of the microfluidic channel. We modeled the microfluidic channel as a distributed transmission line segment and as a single RLCG elemental segment. Both approaches analytically yield the circuit capacitance CF and conductance GF per unit length of the segment incorporating the microfluidic channel. A finite element electromagnetic simulator is then used to obtain the permittivity of the fluid as a continuous function of frequency. We applied this technique to extract the permittivity of submicroliter liquid volumes. Here we present results on polystyrene latex beads suspended in an aqueous solution over the frequency range from 100 MHz to 40 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380523","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263866.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Permittivity of Liquids Extracted from Transmission Line Measurements of Microfluidic Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Permittivity of Liquids Extracted from Transmission Line Measurements of Microfluidic Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727588","htmlLink":"/document/4263866/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Permittivity of Liquids Extracted from Transmission Line Measurements of Microfluidic Channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063974S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4263866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4263877,"authors":[{"name":"Munkyo Seo","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Munkyo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37418869300"},{"name":"Bharath Ananthasubramaniam","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bharath","lastName":"Ananthasubramaniam","id":"37284010800"},{"name":"Mark Rodwell","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Rodwell","id":"37270330900"},{"name":"Upamanyu Madhow","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Upamanyu","lastName":"Madhow","id":"37274246600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0687-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0688-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"4263877","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263877","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Image sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Optical imaging","Prototypes","Optical sensors","Large-scale systems","Extraterrestrial measurements","Frequency measurement","Employment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave detectors","millimetre wave imaging","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeterwave imaging sensor nets","wireless sensor network","data collection","data localization","millimeterwave beacon","angular location measurement","2D matched filtering","low-cost passive sensor","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor network","localization","radio position measurement","beam steering","millimeterwave communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380552","endPage":"566","startPage":"563","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeterwave Imaging Sensor Nets: A Scalable 60-GHz Wireless Sensor Network","abstract":"We report first experimental results on the prototype for a novel wireless sensor network that offers both data collection and localization capability.

The methodology utilizes a Lagrangian approach to solve a modified set of Maxwell's equations on a map of the physical domain, for which all boundaries are parallel to a Cartesian coordinate system. Hence, a rectangular Yee's lattice can be used for the spatial discretization of Maxwell's equations. The proposed scheme avoids the need for the staircase approximation of curved boundaries and provides for enhanced accuracy in a systematic manner. The proposed methodology is validated through its application to the modeling of wave propagation through the two-dimensional geometry of a non-uniform section of a parallel-plate waveguide formed by the cascading of two exponential tapers.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380021","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","startPage":"717","endPage":"720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lagrangian Approach for the Handling of Curved Boundaries in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Lagrangian Approach for the Handling of Curved Boundaries in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263918/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9718824","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4263918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lagrangian Approach for the Handling of Curved Boundaries in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055047S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4263918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4263919,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis M.

Off-diagonal terms of permittivity or permeability tensors lead to the coupling between two orthogonal E-or H-field components, respectively. To avoid the need for large matrix inversion, several explicit and implicit ways of decoupling the system have been proposed in the literature, and are investigated herein, together with a new asymmetrical semi-implicit approach. To accentuate the effect of component coupling, as opposed to the dispersion effects, a unified model of gyrotropic media is proposed reflecting the worse case dispersion asymptotic behaviour of magnetised ferrites and magnetised plasma. It is shown that explicit and, counter-intuitively, also implicit FDTD schemes are inherently unstable. It is also shown that the FDTD algorithms are stabilised via either semi-implicit or, again counter-intuitively, higher order implicit approach.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380041","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","startPage":"725","endPage":"728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Stability of FDTD Algorithms in Gyrotropic Media Analysed through Their Dispersion Relations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4263920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Stability of FDTD Algorithms in Gyrotropic Media Analysed through Their Dispersion Relations","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263920/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727623","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4263920/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Stability of FDTD Algorithms in Gyrotropic Media Analysed through Their Dispersion Relations","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06585S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4263920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4263921,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Qing-xin","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chu","lastName":"Qing-xin","id":"38272082300"},{"name":"Chen Zhi-hui","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhi-hui","id":"38270733300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0687-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0688-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"4263921","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"The numerical dispersion characteristic of the extended ADI-FDTD algorithm including lumped models is systematically studied in this paper, and three common lumped models are investigated: resistor, capacitor and inductor, and their explicit, semi-implicit, and implicit temporal difference scheme are discussed.

The atmosphere and materials exhibit attenuating characteristics that can vary markedly with frequency. These phenomenological issues must be traded off with component performance, architectural designs, as well as resolution requirements.

The purpose of the presented switch-based model is to facilitate and speed up considerably extraction and implementation of large-signal device models for computer added design (CAD). Only a small number of DC and low-frequency small-signal S-parameter measurements are required for the extraction of the complete set of element parameters of the model. Accuracy and efficacy of the nonlinear model in predicting the performance of a single-ended RF power amplifier (PA) is demonstrated by experimental results. For a PA based on a commercial GaN HEMT, measured output power and efficiency match with simulations over a broad frequency range. Moreover, robustness of the developed switch-based model is demonstrated by the design of a voltage-mode class-D PA.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380078","startPage":"795","endPage":"798","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04263939.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switch-based GaN HEMT model suitable for highly-efficient RF power amplifier design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Switch-based GaN HEMT model suitable for highly-efficient RF power amplifier design","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4263939/","accessionNumber":"9727633","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4263939/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switch-based GaN HEMT model suitable for highly-efficient RF power amplifier design","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043712S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4263939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4263942,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan B.

The PA is nonlinear since it is compressed by 2.2 dB when achieving a 59% PAE at 10 GHz. Load-pull is performed under a two-tone test and the resulting optimal efficiency impedance is found to be over 30% different from the single-tone load-pull. In addition standard two-tone load-pull measurements indicate that the impedance for max P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">out</sub>\n coincide with worst nonlinearity (IMD).

Therefore, under polar modulation a different matching circuit should be designed for optimal linearity and efficiency. The PA is part of a digital polar transmitter which enables linearization including phase predistortion, with IMD levels over 11 dB lower than in the standard two-tone test. Load-pull performed on the polar class-E PA shows that the level of intermodulation products varies for different signals input into the PA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4264015/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727690","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linearity of X-band Class-E Power Amplifiers in a Digital Polar Transmitter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity of X-band Class-E Power Amplifiers in a Digital Polar Transmitter","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046973S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4264016,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For GaN HEMT and SiC MESFET cases, the power-added efficiency (PAE) of 70% with a gain of 13.0 dB and 72.3% with a gain of 10.3 dB are achieved at an output power of 43.0 dBm and 40.3 dBm, respectively, through significant reduction of harmonic power levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264019.pdf","startPage":"1099","endPage":"1102","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of GaN HEMTs and SiC MESFETs in High Efficiency Class-E Power Amplifier Design for WCDMA Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","HEMTs","MODFETs","Silicon carbide","MESFETs","High power amplifiers","Multiaccess communication","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","MOS integrated circuits","Schottky gate field effect transistors","silicon compounds","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEMT","high electron mobility transistors","MESFET","Schottky gate field effect transistors","class-E power amplifier","WCDMA","harmonics suppression","power-added efficiency","PAE","frequency 2.14 GHz","gain 13.0 dB","gain 10.3 dB","GaN","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E power amplifier","GaN HEMT","power added efficiency","SiC MESFET","Si LDMOS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applications of GaN HEMTs and SiC MESFETs in High Efficiency Class-E Power Amplifier Design for WCDMA Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4264019/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727694","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of GaN HEMTs and SiC MESFETs in High Efficiency Class-E Power Amplifier Design for WCDMA Applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04954S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4264020,"authors":[{"name":"Hifumi Noto","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hifumi","lastName":"Noto","id":"37640504200"},{"name":"Kazuhisa Yamauchi","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhisa","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37274606200"},{"name":"Masatoshi Nakayama","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Nakayama","id":"37274586500"},{"name":"Yoji Isota","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoji","lastName":"Isota","id":"37298341400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0687-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0688-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"4264020","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":907},"abstract":"We present a design and an implementation of a negative group delay circuit, which consists of lumped parameter element.

For relative dielectric permittivity measurements a square ring resonator prototype has been fabricated. Three solvents have been used as standards to measure seven unknowns at 1GHz, 2GHz and 3GHz. The measured results show excellent agreement with theoretical. An open loop resonator has also been developed to characterize glucose-water solutions of various concentrations at 1GHz.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380342","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264041.pdf","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip Resonator Technique for Measuring Dielectric Permittivity of Liquid Solvents and for Solution Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264041/","displayDocTitle":"Microstrip Resonator Technique for Measuring Dielectric Permittivity of Liquid Solvents and for Solution Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727712","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4264041/","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstrip Resonator Technique for Measuring Dielectric Permittivity of Liquid Solvents and for Solution Sensing","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047306S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4264055,"authors":[{"name":"Isar Mostafanezhad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Isar","lastName":"Mostafanezhad","id":"37398471700"},{"name":"Byung-Kwon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Byung-Kwon","lastName":"Park","id":"37291732100"},{"name":"Olga Boric-Lubecke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Boric-Lubecke","id":"38277504400"},{"name":"Victor Lubecke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lubecke","id":"38508230200"},{"name":"Anders Host-Madsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Host-Madsen","id":"37284887100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0687-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0688-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"4264055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264055","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler radar","Humans","Radar detection","Mechanical sensors","Stability","Antenna measurements","Phase measurement","Phase detection","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","Doppler radar","medical signal processing","radar applications","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar measurement","human life signs","monostatic Doppler radar","CW mode","phase stability","mechanical motion","transmit antenna","received signal","bistatic radar","sensor node receiver","biomedical monitoring","biomedical signal detection","range correlation","cardiopulmonary monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","biomedical signal detection","Doppler radar","range correlation","sensor nodes"]}],"abstract":"Human life signs can be detected at a distance using mono-static Doppler radars operating in the CW mode.

A carrier amplifier and a peak amplifier in the Doherty amplifier are set to asymmetrical drain voltages to extend the power range where a high drain efficiency of the Doherty amplifier is maintained. Matching circuits of the carrier amplifier and the peak amplifier are designed for each drain voltage so that the drain efficiency and signal linearity of the Doherty amplifier at a 9 dB backoff point from its saturated output power (Psat) become higher than those of a conventional Doherty amplifier. These simple steps optimize the power range of the Doherty amplifier for a wideband code-division multiple-access (W-CDMA) signal that has a peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of 9 dB. A Doherty amplifier containing gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) achieves an adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) of -38 dBc and a drain efficiency of 50% at an output power of 45 dBm. This is the highest drain efficiency of a Doherty amplifier for a W-CDMA signal to the best of the authors' knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380422","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264061.pdf","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"50% Drain Efficiency Doherty Amplifier with Optimized Power Range for W-CDMA Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264061/","displayDocTitle":"50% Drain Efficiency Doherty Amplifier with Optimized Power Range for W-CDMA Signal","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727727","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4264061/","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"50% Drain Efficiency Doherty Amplifier with Optimized Power Range for W-CDMA Signal","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038936S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4264062,"authors":[{"name":"J.X.

Among all the linearization techniques, Digital Predistortion (DPD) is one of the most cost effective. For wider bandwidth applications, PA memory effects can no longer be ignored. Therefore in order to achieve a higher linearization performance, the Predistorter (PD) requires to compensate for memory nonlinearities. In this paper a new PD model based on piecewise polynomial approximation in the form of splines is described and compared with memory polynomial PD. The purpose of the spline PD is to increase the approximation accuracy and/or reduce the complexity. Simulation results with 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) show a significant improvement in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) for a Wiener-Hammerstein power amplifier model. A set-up to perform the measurements on a 100 watt High Power Amplifier (HPA) is also developed. The experiments are carried out on both an uplink WCDMA and a crest-reduced two-carrier WCDMA signal. The results show that a higher linearization performance is obtained by using spline basis functions as compared to conventional memory polynomial PD.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380504","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264109.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1444","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spline-Based Model for Digital Predistortion of Wide-Band Signals for High Power Amplifier Linearization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spline-Based Model for Digital Predistortion of Wide-Band Signals for High Power Amplifier Linearization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4264109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9718856","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264109/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spline-Based Model for Digital Predistortion of Wide-Band Signals for High Power Amplifier Linearization","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044354S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4264111,"authors":[{"name":"SungWon Chung","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"SungWon","lastName":"Chung","id":"37536639800"},{"name":"Jack W.

Indeed, the amplifiers represent prototype test vehicles for a larger hybrid amplifier to be used as the final power stage in the transmitting chain of a T/R module of an L-band SAR antenna for earth observation. The amplifiers described in this paper exploit a discrete bar of a commercial 0.35\u03bcm pHEMT process as active device. The first amplifier, featuring a single discrete device, delivers 12 Watts with 56.5% PAE and 12.3 dB gain at 2 dB compression. The second amplifier exploits 4 discrete pHEMT bars using input/output microstrip splitter/combiner and lumped wire bonding/ceramic MIM capacitor output matching networks. It delivers 42 watts with 50% PAE and 13 dB gain at 2.5 dB compression. Since it is a space application, these performances have been achieved with the required de-rating on break-down voltages, current densities and operating channel temperature. The latter has been evaluated by means of a 3-D device model implemented in the framework of a finite differences numerical thermal simulator. In spite of the constraints due to space de-rating rules, the obtained output power densities are 1W/mm and 0.875W/mm for the single-discrete and the 4-discrete amplifiers, respectively, which represent a value very close to the state of the art for pHEMT processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4264149/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727791","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid High Power Amplifiers for L-Band Space Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid High Power Amplifiers for L-Band Space Application","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047875S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4264161,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yang","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Li Yang","id":"37087023140"},{"name":"Manos M.

Through a multiport decoupling network, these modes can be separated into different independent driving ports and matched individually; hence, although the strong mutual coupling still exists between the antennas, the mutual coupling between the modes are destructively canceled. The close antenna spacing impacts on the radiation impedances and the radiation Q factors of the higher order modes rather than the existence of the modes themselves. This finding overcomes the degradation caused by strong mutual coupling and leads to practical supergain arrays for beamforming. A pair of closely coupled monopole antennas is built as an example to validate this concept. Simulation and experiment have shown, with a pair of quarter-wave monopoles at 0.1\u03bb spacing, 4~5dB gain increase of a single quarter-wave monopole can be achieved, which is very close to the ideal theoretical directivity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264185.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1726","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode-Based Beamforming with Closely Spaced Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Mutual coupling","MIMO","Antenna radiation patterns","Impedance","Directive antennas","Optical coupling","Antenna arrays","Q factor","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","coupled circuits","monopole antenna arrays","multiport networks","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode-based beamforming","closely spaced antennas","orthogonal radiation mode","multiport decoupling network","driving port","mutual coupling","radiation impedance","radiation Q factor","supergain arrays","closely coupled monopole antenna","quarter-wave monopoles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","decoupling of systems","directive antennas","MIMO systems","multiport circuits","mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Mode-Based Beamforming with Closely Spaced Antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4264185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727814","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode-Based Beamforming with Closely Spaced Antennas","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078086S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4264199,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For the same power consumption, a cascode LNA optimized for narrowband exhibits a gain of 17 dB, a noise figure of 2.5 dB. This LNA also achieves a gain of 10 dB and 3.6 dB noise figure for an associated power consumption of only 0.8 mW. These values are the best reported X-band gains per mW DC power reported in any technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","Heterojunction

The electromagnetic design and experimental evaluation of two antenna arrays in the 2-6 and 6-18 GHz bands, with 2 x 7 x 8 elements each, is described. The electromagnetic performance has been simulated using commercial and in-house developed codes. Experimental evaluation show that the arrays have reflection levels below -10 dB and good radiation properties in a frequency range of up to 1:3 and scan angles of up to 60deg. A concept with wideband reconfigurable beamforming with frequency tapered aperture areas is also presented. Two objectives are to enable adaptation of beamwidths to different requirements, and to enable a frequency independent beamwidth over a wide frequency range.

The LNAs have been characterized through the measurement of phase modulation (PM) noise power spectral density as a function of carrier power level. The degradation of the amplifier noise figure (NF) due to input power is obtained from the residual PM white noise. Measurements show that the LNA NF can increase dramatically with the gain compression level. The growth of NF in nonlinear operating conditions can be explained due to the gain compression itself and the increasing level of the internal noise added by the amplifier. The flicker PM noise behavior introduced by the amplifier is also discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise figure","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise measurement","Noise level","1f noise","Density measurement","Power measurement","Phase measurement","Phase modulation","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flicker noise","low noise amplifiers","phase modulation","phase noise","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase modulation noise","amplifier noise figure","low noise amplifier","LNA","power spectral density","white noise","nonlinear operating condition","gain compression","flicker PM noise","small signal conditions","large signal conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear noise","low noise amplifier","noise figure","phase modulation noise","noise measurements","additive noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380300","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4263706/4263707/04264282.pdf","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4263707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2007.380300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of PM Noise and Noise Figure in Low Noise Amplifiers Working under Small and Large Signal Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study of PM Noise and Noise Figure in Low Noise Amplifiers Working under Small and Large Signal Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264282/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4264282/","accessionNumber":"9727887","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of PM Noise and Noise Figure in Low Noise Amplifiers Working under Small and Large Signal Conditions","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSYM-00-575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057534S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4263706","isNumber":"4263707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4263706","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4263707","articleId":"4264282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4264283,"authors":[{"name":"David E.

We report that an effective solution is the recasting of the input artificial transmission line into a transformer filter that matches the more favorable high resistor values to the external impedance.

The filter is tuned from 2.71 to 4.03 GHz, with insertion losses ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 dB across the range for a 2.5% bandwidth filter. Secondarily, an exceptionally narrow band filter is fabricated to show the potential for using the actuators to fine tune the response to compensate for fabrication tolerances. While most traditional machining techniques would not allow for such narrow band filtering, the high-Q and the sensitive tuning combine to allow for near channel selection for a front-end receiver. For further analysis, a widely tunable resonator is also created with a 100% tunable frequency range, from 2.3 to 4.6 GHz. The resonator analysis gives unloaded quality factors ranging from 360 to 700 with a maximum frequency loading of 89%.

Among others, how we can achieve message efficiency for saving resource consumption has been the focus of research. In this paper, we present the HC protocol, a message efficient consensus protocol for MANETs. We consider the widely used system model where the hosts fail by crashes and the system is equipped with Chandra-Toueg's unreliable failure detectors. Unlike existing consensus protocols, the HC protocol uses a two-layer hierarchy based on clusters to achieve message efficiency. The messages from and to the hosts in the same cluster are merged so as to reduce the message cost. However, adding such a hierarchy is not trivial. Due to host movements and failures, the hierarchy changes from time to time and this may cause message loss. In designing HC, we also propose methods to handle such message losses. Extensive simulations have been carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of the HC protocol and similar protocols in a MANET environment. Simulation results show that, in most cases, our protocol can significantly reduce both the message cost and time cost. With increases in the system scale or the percentage of faulty hosts, the advantage of our protocol becomes more obvious.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4264315/04264321.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4264315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance Evaluation of Efficient Consensus Protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance Evaluation of Efficient Consensus Protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264321/","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4264321/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606440","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance Evaluation of Efficient Consensus Protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"t1055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096178S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4264315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4264315","articleId":"4264321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4264324,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Yeh Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4264315/4264324/4264324-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Yeh Wang received the BS and MS degrees in electronics engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China, in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

This methodology utilizes the rapid computing of statistical analysis and the accurate evaluation of simulation-based analysis to investigate a speedy optimization flow. A statistical error model for varying word-lengths of PE stages of an FFT processor was developed to support this optimization flow. Experimental results designate that the word-length optimization employing the speedy flow reduces the percentage of the total area of the FFT processor that increases with an increasing FFT length. Finally, the proposed hybrid method requires a shorter prediction time than the absolute simulation-based method does and achieves more accurate outcomes than a statistical calculation does.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4264315/04264324.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4264315","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Wordlength Optimization Methods of Pipelined FFT Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4264324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Wordlength Optimization Methods of Pipelined FFT Processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4264324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9656216","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4264324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Wordlength Optimization Methods of Pipelined FFT Processors","sourcePdf":"t1105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089533S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4264315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4264315","articleId":"4264324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4264327,"authors":[{"name":"Xrysovalantis Kavousianos","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Ioannina (UoI), Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Xrysovalantis","lastName":"Kavousianos","id":"37273655300"},{"name":"Emmanouil Kalligeros","affiliation":["Computer Science and Technology Department, University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece","Computer Science Department, University of Ioannina (UoI), Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Kalligeros","id":"37284912500"},{"name":"Dimitris Nikolos","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Nikolos","id":"37273491600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4264327","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":878},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"Selective Huffman coding has recently been proposed for efficient test- data compression with low hardware overhead.

A 4-pole quasi-elliptic bandpass filter composed of four open loop resonators has been developed. It exhibits an insertion loss <3.5 dB, a return loss >15 dB over the pass band (~3.4 GHz) and a 3 dB bandwidth of about 5.46% (~3.4 GHz) at the center frequency of 62.3 GHz. In addition, a series fed 1 4 linear antenna array of four microstrip patches exhibiting high gain and fan-beam radiation pattern has been designed. Its 10 dB bandwidth is experimentally validated to be 55.4-66.8 GHz (~18.5%). The above proposed designs have been combined together, leading to the complete integration of passives with a high level of selectivity over the band of interest. The excellent overall performance of the integrated solution is verified through a 10-dB bandwidth of 4.8 GHz (59.2-64 GHz) and a return loss >10.5 dB over the passband.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4099326/04265587.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2007.891964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2007.891964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Integrated Passive Front-End Solutions for a V-band LTCC Wireless System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Microstrip antenna arrays","Band pass filters","Microstrip antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Topology","Resonator filters","Ceramics","Insertion loss","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","band-pass filters","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave filters","passive filters","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth 4.8 GHz","frequency 62.3 GHz","fan-beam radiation pattern","microstrip patches","linear antenna array","open loop resonators","quasielliptic bandpass filter","V-band modules","low-temperature cofired ceramic","system-on-package","antenna function","3D fully integrated filter","V-band LTCC wireless system","fully integrated passive front-end"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Front-end module","integrated passives","low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC)","millimeter-wave (mm-wave)","patch antenna","quasi-elliptic filters","system-on-package (SOP)","V-band"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fully Integrated Passive Front-End Solutions for a V-band LTCC Wireless System","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4265587/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2007","accessionNumber":"9609725","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Integrated Passive Front-End Solutions for a V-band LTCC Wireless System","sourcePdf":"06lawp01-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043669S","chronDate":"2007","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4099326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4099326","articleId":"4265587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4265594,"authors":[{"name":"Reuven Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4265591/4265594/4265594-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reuven Cohen (M'93\u2013SM'99) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1985, 1988, and 1991, respectively.","From 1991 to 1993, he was with the IBM T.

To this end, it must take into account not only the deadlines of the pending packets, but also the channel conditions for each potential sender, the requirements of nonsynchronous applications, and the packet retransmission strategy. With respect to these factors, we identify three scheduling scenarios and show that the scheduler logic faces a different challenge in addressing each of them. We then present a generic scheduling algorithm that translates all the factors relevant to each scenario into a common profit parameter, and selects the most profitable transmission instances.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893875","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4265591/04265594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265591","startPage":"932","endPage":"943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Quantitative Approach to the Scheduling of Synchronous Packets in a Shared Uplink Wireless Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Quantitative Approach to the Scheduling of Synchronous Packets in a Shared Uplink Wireless Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9605407","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4265594/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Quantitative Approach to the Scheduling of Synchronous Packets in a Shared Uplink Wireless Channel","sourcePdf":"15tnet04-cohen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104409S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4265591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4265591","articleId":"4265594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4265599,"authors":[{"name":"Gbor Fodor","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Kista, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4265591/4265599/4265599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["G\u00e1bor Fodor (M'98) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering (telecommunications) from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary, in 1988 and 1998, respectively.","Between 1993 and 1997, he was a member of the High Speed Networks Laboratory at BUTE, Budapest, Hungary, where he was involved in several joint research projects with Ericsson Research.

This present work extends the classical Kaufman-Roberts formula such that it becomes applicable in CDMA systems in which elastic services with state-dependent instantaneous bit rate and average-bit-rate-dependent residency time are supported. Our model captures the effect of soft blocking, that is, an arriving session may be blocked in virtually all system states but with a state dependent probability. The core of this method is to approximate the original irreversible Markov chain with a reversible one and to give lower and upper bounds on the so-called partially blocking macro states of the state space. We employ this extended formula to establish lower and upper bounds on the steady state and the classwise blocking probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893880","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4265591/04265599.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounding the Blocking Probabilities in Multirate CDMA Networks Supporting Elastic Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265599/","displayDocTitle":"Bounding the Blocking Probabilities in Multirate CDMA Networks Supporting Elastic Services","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9609612","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265599/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounding the Blocking Probabilities in Multirate CDMA Networks Supporting Elastic Services","sourcePdf":"15tnet04-fodor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070557S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4265591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4265591","articleId":"4265599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4265602,"authors":[{"name":"Bernardo A.

More precisely, optimal data rate adaptation and load balancing laws are provided which are applicable to networks where multiple paths are available and multiple classes of service (CoS) are to be provided. Different types of multiple paths are supported, including point-to-point multiple paths, point-to-multipoint multiple paths, and multicast trees. In particular, it is shown that the algorithms presented only need a minimal amount of information for optimal control, i.e., whether a path is congested or not. Hence, the control laws provided in this paper allow source inferred congestion detection without the need for explicit congestion feedback from the network. The proposed approach is applicable to utility functions of a very general form and endows the network with the important property of robustness with respect to node/link failures; i.e., upon the occurrence of such a failure, the presented control laws reroute traffic away from the inoperative node/link and converge to the optimal allocation for the ldquoreducedrdquo network. The proposed control laws set the foundation for the development of highly scalable feature-rich traffic control protocols at the IP, transport, or higher layers with provable global stability and convergence properties.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893874","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4265591/04265602.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Optimal Algorithms for Integrated QoS, Traffic Engineering, and Failure Recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265602/","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Optimal Algorithms for Integrated QoS, Traffic Engineering, and Failure Recovery","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607172","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265602/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Optimal Algorithms for Integrated QoS, Traffic Engineering, and Failure Recovery","sourcePdf":"15tnet04-movsichoff.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11188S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4265591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4265591","articleId":"4265602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4265622,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chi Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4265616/4265622/4265622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Chi Cheng was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1982.

Theory for decimation/interpolation in the DCT domain is presented, and its implementation with fast algorithms is shown. Motivated by the compositing of several video sources in multipoint video conferencing, we propose a new method for single streams that uses the proposed DCT-decimation in the encoder and the corresponding DCT-interpolation in the decoder. Decimated video frames are encoded using an embedded zerotree and an adaptive arithmetic coder to improve the quality of the decoded videos. Zerotree coding is a progressive coding method that quantizes amplitudes of DCT coefficients of video frames into bit streams with increasing precision. Embedded coding scheme depends on coding a symbol by an adaptive arithmetic encoder as soon as the symbol is obtained by the zerotree coding. Zerotree coder gives flexibility of controlling the bit rate precisely at given target bit rate. Compared to conventional coding our proposed algorithm achieves peak signal-to-noise ratio improvements at low bit rate video coding.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.898655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4265616/04265629.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.898655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"833","endPage":"844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Bit Rate Video Coding Using DCT-Based Fast Decimation/Interpolation and Embedded Zerotree Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low Bit Rate Video Coding Using DCT-Based Fast Decimation/Interpolation and Embedded Zerotree Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265629/","volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4265629/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605946","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Bit Rate Video Coding Using DCT-Based Fast Decimation/Interpolation and Embedded Zerotree Coding","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt07-ilgin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083569S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4265616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4265616","articleId":"4265629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4265637,"authors":[{"name":"Fayal Saffih","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratory, University of McMaster, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Fayal","lastName":"Saffih","id":"37698301900"},{"name":"Richard Hornsey","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Hornsey","id":"37273160700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4265637","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Noise reduction","CMOS image sensors","Image sampling","Pixel","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Visual system","Spatial filters","CMOS process","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","spatial filters","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced human perception","fixed pattern noise","CMOS image sensor","CMOS active pixel sensor imager","pyramidal readout architecture","2D ring sampling","diagonal output buses","imager readout speed enhancement","human visual system","spatial filter","pyramidal CMOS imager"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active pixel sensor","CMOS imager","human visual system","oblique effect","pyramidal architecture"]}],"abstract":"A novel CMOS active pixel sensor imager, called pyramidal readout architecture, is presented in which the 1D row sampling of a classical imager is replaced by a 2D ring sampling and diagonal output buses.

Receiver-driven layered multicast (RLM) efficiently addresses the issue of heterogeneity in clients' available bandwidths and packet loss rates by shifting rate control to the receiver side. We propose a system for RLM over the Internet and 3G wireless networks based on layered Wyner-Ziv video coding and digital fountain codes. Layered Wyner-Ziv video coding improves robustness to packet loss compared to current scalable video coders, such as MPEG-4 FGS coder, while generating a scalable output bit stream. Digital fountain codes are near-capacity erasure protection codes that are ideally suited for multicast applications due to their rateless property. By combining an error-resilient Wyner-Ziv video coder and rateless fountain codes, our system allows reliable video multicast to an arbitrary number of heterogeneous receivers without the requirement of feedback channels. Simulation results show performance improvements over a previous scheme that exploits multiple description and layered coding.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.897464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4265616/04265639.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.897464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Compression and Fountain Codes for Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265639/","displayDocTitle":"Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Compression and Fountain Codes for Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast","volume":"17","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607667","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265639/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Compression and Fountain Codes for Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt07-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096617S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4265616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4265616","articleId":"4265639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4265649,"authors":[{"name":"Peter G.

However, the usefulness of the method in a commercial available system is very much dependent on whether the SVM classifier can be pretrained from a factory since it is not realistic that the SVM classifier must be trained by the customers themselves before it can be used. This paper proposes a novel SVM classification system for voltage disturbances. The performance of the proposed SVM classifier is investigated when the voltage disturbance data used for training and testing originated from different sources. The data used in the experiments were obtained from both real disturbances recorded in two different power networks and from synthetic data. The experimental results shown high accuracy in classification with training data from one power network and unseen testing data from another. High accuracy was also achieved when the SVM classifier was trained on data from a real power network and test data originated from synthetic data. A lower accuracy resulted when the SVM classifier was trained on synthetic data and test data originated from the power network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.900065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265649.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1303","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.900065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machine for Classification of Voltage Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machine for Classification of Voltage Disturbances","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4265649/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9597581","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machine for Classification of Voltage Disturbances","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-axelberg.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053433S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4265653,"authors":[{"name":"Sukumar M.

An orthogonal array is first conducted to obtain the initial solution set. The set is then treated as the initial training sample. Next, a back-propagation sequential neural network is trained to simulate the feasible domain for seeking the optimal filter design. The size of the training sample is greatly reduced due to the use of the orthogonal array. In addition, a restart strategy is also incorporated into the SNAOA so that the searching process may have a better opportunity to reach a near global optimum. To illustrate the performance of the SNAOA, a practical harmonic mitigation problem in a chemical plant is studied. The results show that the SNAOA performs better than the original scheme and satisfies the harmonic limitations with respect to the objective of minimizing the total demand distortion of harmonic currents and total harmonic distortion of voltages. Filter loss, reactive power compensation, and the constraints of individual harmonics are also considered. Additional results related to SNAOA are also reported and discussed as well.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899780","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265657.pdf","startPage":"1813","endPage":"1821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of Discrete-Value Passive Harmonic Filters Using Sequential Neural-Network Approximation and Orthogonal Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of Discrete-Value Passive Harmonic Filters Using Sequential Neural-Network Approximation and Orthogonal Array","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598962","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4265657/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of Discrete-Value Passive Harmonic Filters Using Sequential Neural-Network Approximation and Orthogonal Array","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-chang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100409S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":4265659,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Jung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4265647/4265659/4265659-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Jung Chen received the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1998.

The main purpose of this work is to verify the capability of the gate-controlled series capacitor (GCSC) to mitigate SSR.

The actual possibility of controlling SSR was verified by digital simulation using the alternative transients program/electromagnetic transients program. As a result it was shown that GCSC can damp SSR even without a specific control. It was also shown that, using a simple controller, SSR as well as electromechanical oscillation can be damped.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power capacitors","Thyristors","Resonance","Power transmission lines","Flexible AC transmission systems","Load flow","Testing","Resistors","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","IEEE standards","power system simulation","power transmission control","power transmission lines","steam turbines","subsynchronous resonance","turbogenerators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power oscillation damping","gate-controlled series capacitors","GCSC","subsynchronous resonance","SSR","steam turbine-generator","transmission line","series compensation","digital simulation","alternative transients program","electromagnetic transients program","electromechanical oscillation","flexible AC transmission systems","IEEE first benchmark model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controlled series compensation","flexible ac transmission system (FACTS)","GCSC","IEEE First Benchmark","subsynchronous resonance (SSR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265669.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSR and Power Oscillation Damping Using Gate-Controlled Series Capacitors (GCSC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SSR and Power Oscillation Damping Using Gate-Controlled Series Capacitors (GCSC)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265669/","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265669/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9598965","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSR and Power Oscillation Damping Using Gate-Controlled Series Capacitors (GCSC)","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-dejesus.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060355S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4265670,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Deschrijver","affiliation":["University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Dirk Deschrijver was born in Tielt, Belgium, on September 26, 1981.

However, FT suffers from the high computational effort especially when the number of phases increases and it is unable to provide information concerning time content because it provides only an amplitude-frequency spectrum. On the other hand, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preserves both time and frequency information while reducing the computational effort through dividing the frequency spectrum into bands and thus overcomes the limitations of FT. In this paper the three-phase power components definitions contained in the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 are reformulated using the DWT and thus redefined in the time-frequency domain. Also in order to study system unbalance, the concept of symmetrical components is defined in the wavelet domain. The results obtained from applying the IEEE Standard definitions and the DWT-based definitions to balanced and unbalanced three-phase systems under nonsinusoidal operating conditions, indicate that the DWT-based definitions are very accurate and the problem of spectral leakages can be reduced by suitable choice of the mother wavelet and the wavelet family. The DWT-based definitions are useful in studying nonstationary waveforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265704.pdf","startPage":"1917","endPage":"1925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reformulating Three-Phase Power Components Definitions Contained in the IEEE Standard 1459\u20132000 Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Multiresolution analysis","Frequency conversion","Wavelet domain","Reactive power","Fourier transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Wavelet transforms","Power measurement","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","IEEE standards","power apparatus","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency domain","unbalanced three-phase system","discrete wavelet transform","IEEE standard 1459-2000","power component definition reformulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power","apparent power","Daubechies wavelet (db10)","harmonics","nonsinusoidal conditions","reactive power","three-phase systems","wavelet transform (WT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reformulating Three-Phase Power Components Definitions Contained in the IEEE Standard 1459\u20132000 Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4265704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9597593","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reformulating Three-Phase Power Components Definitions Contained in the IEEE Standard 1459\u20132000 Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-morsi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128352S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4265716,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this study, a model winding was used. From knowledge of its measured short-circuit and open-circuit natural frequencies, and pertinent winding data, an equivalent circuit was synthesized (called reference circuit). Next, changes were introduced at different locations in the model winding and its natural frequencies were measured. Corresponding to every new set of measured natural frequencies, a new circuit was synthesized (with topology remaining unchanged). A comparison of these circuits with the reference circuit revealed that a mapping could be established between changes introduced in the model winding and those predicted by the synthesized circuits. Many case studies are presented by considering continuous-disc and interleaved winding representations. Reasonably good results were obtained. Thus, localization of changes, based on terminal measurements, is shown to be a possibility. So, it is believed that these findings could be of some assistance in addressing the ultimate task of locating mechanical deformations in actual transformer windings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","Frequency synthesizers","Equivalent circuits","Windings","Frequency measurement","Iterative methods","Circuit topology","Predictive models","Condition monitoring","Impulse testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","network topology","reference circuits","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformer windings","mechanical deformations","interleaved winding representations","continuous-disc representations","reference circuit","equivalent circuit","open-circuit natural frequencies","short-circuit natural frequencies","iterative circuit synthesis approach","terminal measurements","transformer model winding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","driving-point functions","open-circuit and short-circuit natural frequencies","winding deformation and localization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2006.886789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265716.pdf","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2006.886789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of Changes in a Model Winding Based on Terminal Measurements: Experimental Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization of Changes in a Model Winding Based on Terminal Measurements: Experimental Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265716/","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265716/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9596778","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of Changes in a Model Winding Based on Terminal Measurements: Experimental Study","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-ragavan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058946S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4265719,"authors":[{"name":"Mamun Bin Ibne Reaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4265647/4265719/4265719-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mamun Bin Ibne Reaz was born in Bangladesh in December 1963.

This paper employes a different type of univariate randomly optimized neural network combined with discrete wavelet transform and fuzzy logic to have a better power quality disturbance classification accuracy. The disturbances of interest include sag, swell, transient, fluctuation, and interruption. The system is modeled using VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL), a hardware description language, followed by extensive testing and simulation to verify the functionality of the system that allows efficient hardware implementation of the same.

The SVM strategy is based on a sequential sampling technique. The SVM provides harmonic cancellation/minimization by introducing appropriate phase shift for the corresponding voltage harmonics of the converter modules, while maintaining the fundamental voltage components of modules in-phase to obtain maximum ac-side voltage. The SVM eliminates the need for complicated transformer arrangement for harmonic reduction, and thus provides high degree of modularity by utilization of identical transformers for converter modules. The proposed SVM strategy is developed for a back-to-back HVDC converter station in which each converter system is composed of four identical modules. Based on a dynamic model of the system, converter controls are designed and performance of the SVM strategy in terms of converter harmonics and dynamic performance are presented.

The use of a DC power system to supply sensitive electronic loads will have lower losses compared with a conventional AC uninterruptible power-supply solution due to fewer power conversion steps.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2006.883024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2006.883024","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265723.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Voltage DC Distribution System for Commercial Power Systems With Sensitive Electronic Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low-Voltage DC Distribution System for Commercial Power Systems With Sensitive Electronic Loads","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598977","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4265723/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Voltage DC Distribution System for Commercial Power Systems With Sensitive Electronic Loads","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-salomonsson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082388S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"411","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4265724,"authors":[{"name":"Su Sheng","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China","Changsha University of Science and Technology, Hunan, China","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4265647/4265724/4265724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Su Sheng (M'06) received the M.Sc degree from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2002.

The application of a wide-area broadband network in power utilities introduces underlying danger for protection systems to maloperate when receiving fake data packages from an intruder. This paper proposes identifying a vicious fault by using context information, such as voltage and current, of the same substation. When the protection system detects a fault based on measurements transmitted through a network, it collects all measurements of the substation and feeds these data to a probabilistic neural network. Thereafter, the fault caused by fake data that differs from the known fault pattern can be identified and blocked.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265724.pdf","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2006.886775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2006.886775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context Information-Based Cyber Security Defense of Protection System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer security","Power system protection","Substation protection","Context","Fault diagnosis","Substation automation","Intelligent networks","Instrument transformers","Communication networks","Local area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","local area networks","neural nets","power system protection","substation automation","substation protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault pattern","probabilistic neural network","fake data packages","power utilities","wide-area broadband network","Ethernet-based local-area network","communication network","electronic instrument transformers","intelligent electronic devices-based protection system","substation automation system","context information-based cyber security defense"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber security","probabilistic neural networks (PNNs)","substation automation systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Context Information-Based Cyber Security Defense of Protection System","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4265724/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9600599","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context Information-Based Cyber Security Defense of Protection System","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-sheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063103S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4265725,"authors":[{"name":"Tarlochan S.

In this strategy, besides the minimized harmonic distortion level, the inverter units' fundamental output voltages are also equalized. Therefore, all the inverter units in each phase leg can equally share the exchanged active and reactive power with the utility grid. This greatly helps the DC-link voltages balancing control. A special gating-pattern swapping scheme was developed to further maintain the DC capacitors' charge balance and equalize the current stress of the switching devices. The modulation strategy also includes a redundant operation scheme and a transformer DC magnetization prevention scheme. The performance of the proposed strategy was compared with the conventional fundamental frequency modulation strategy. To implement a fast and robust control of reactive power, a nonlinear feedback linearization controller with a direct voltage control capability was employed. The scheme of modulation index controlling and the operating modulation index range are presented. The effects of the system uncertainties on the closed loop dynamic performance are also discussed.

The algorithm decomposes the current and voltage signals into their first-level details, which consist of frequencies in 500- to 1000-Hz bandwidth, for generating directional signals. A high level of computational efficiency is achieved compared to the other wavelet-transform-based algorithms proposed, since only the high-frequency details at the first level are employed in this algorithm. The validity of this method was exhaustively tested by simulating various types of faults on a substation modeled in the alternative transients program/electromagnetic transients program. The algorithm correctly discriminated between bus faults, various types of external faults, and transformer energization even in the presence of current-transformer saturation. This paper also provides the design details of the algorithm using field-programmable gate array technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4265647/04265734.pdf","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally Efficient Wavelet-Transform-Based Digital Directional Protection for Busbars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Voltage","Frequency","Bandwidth","DC generators","Signal generators","Computational efficiency","Testing","Computational modeling","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["busbars","field programmable gate arrays","power system protection","power system simulation","substation protection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate array technology","substation model","computational efficiency","directional signals","busbars","digital directional protection","wavelet transform","frequency 500 Hz to 1000 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Busbar protection","detail coefficients","digital directional relay","field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation","wavelet transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Efficient Wavelet-Transform-Based Digital Directional Protection for Busbars","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4265734/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596782","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Efficient Wavelet-Transform-Based Digital Directional Protection for Busbars","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd03-valsan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052669S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4265647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4265647","articleId":"4265734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4265742,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Zhongrong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Voltage Engineering and Electrical New Technology.

Since each linear system is numerically underdetermined, the use of prior knowledge in the form of bounded support regions is proposed. To overcome the excessive memory requirements for handling large matrices, a fast implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method is used. Numerical simulation and in vivo experiments using spiral twofold undersampling demonstrate reduced motion artifacts and the improved depiction of fine cardiac structures. The achieved reduction of motion artifacts and motion blur is comparable to simple filtering, which is computationally more efficient, while the proposed algebraic framework offers greater flexibility to incorporate additional algebraic acceleration techniques and to handle arbitrary sampling schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4265754/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596761","pubMedId":"17649905","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Dynamic Spiral MRI by Algebraic Reconstruction From Undersampled <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$k\\hbox{--}t$</tex></formula> Space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Dynamic Spiral MRI by Algebraic Reconstruction From Undersampled <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$k\\hbox{--}t$</tex></formula> Space","sourcePdf":"26tmi07-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08465S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4265743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4265743","articleId":"4265754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4265769,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In the IC assembly factories, the jobs are assigned processing priorities and are clustered by their product types, which must be processed on groups of identical parallel machines. Furthermore, the job processing time depends on the product type, and the machine setup time is sequentially dependent on the orders of jobs processed. Therefore, the ICASP is more difficult to solve than the classical parallel machine scheduling problem. In this paper, we describe the ICASP in detail and formulate the ICASP as in integer programing problem to minimize the total machine workload.

The purposes of this study are twofold: one is to attempt to develop a new, suitable test method for differentiating the factors that affect the variability of die strength, and the other is to investigate the failure and fatigue strengths of silicon dies. In this paper, a new test method, a plate-on-elastic-foundation test (PEFT) associated with point- or line-loading has been proposed and evaluated. It is found that the PEFT can provide not only a simple, chipping-free test for dummy or real IC chips without limitation of size, but also a (bi-axial) stress field similar to the temperature loading. The strength data of failures on IC and ground surfaces in real IC chips are presented. The good consistency of the die strength data with a minor scatter from both the point- and line-load tests is found for the specimens failed on IC surfaces, but not for the ones failed on the ground surfaces. The inconsistency of strength data from both tests for failure on ground surfaces is due to edge chipping involved. The large scatter is caused by the combined factors of the angle of grinding marks, planes of weakness of material, and loading stress states with uni-axial stress for line-load test and with unequal bi-axial stress for point-load test of rectangular specimens. The surface roughness of the dies (including the IC and ground surfaces) measured by atomic force microscopy is correlated with the failure modes and strengths from the tests. It is found that the silicon die strengths are dominated by the roughness on failure surfaces, and their failure modes always appear cracks along the directions parallel and normal to the edges of the die, which might be the weak plane of the crystal lattice of silicon. The specimens with artificial cracks have been further tested. It has been proved that the die strength dominated by the crack initiation depends on the most severe defect but not on the amount of the defects, and its failure mode is controlled by a special weak plane after the crack initiation. Conclusively, there are four factors to influence die strength: the surface conditions of the die (including grinding-mark direction and surface roughness), the edge crack of the die (so-called chipping created during the cutting process), the weak planes of the crystal lattice of silicon, and, sometimes, different tests with various loading conditions. The fatigue strength of the die is also determined to be about 25% lower than the static one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4265772/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9937365","volume":"30","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Testing and Evaluation of Silicon Die Strength","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing and Evaluation of Silicon Die Strength","sourcePdf":"30tepm02-tsai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055404S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4265760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4265760","articleId":"4265772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4265776,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["Laboratoire Syst\u00e8mes et Applications 251 des Technologies de l'Information et de l'Energie (UMR CNRS 8029), University of Cergy-Pontoise SATIE UMR 8029, Cergy-Pontoise Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4265776/4265776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Monmasson (M'97\u2013SM'06) received the Ing. and Ph.D. degrees from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs d'Electrotechnique d'Electronique d'Informatique et d'Hydraulique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 1989 and 1993, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and Head of the Institut Universitaire Professionnalis\u00e9 de G\u00e9nie Electrique et d'Informatique Industrielle (IUP GEII), University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France.

The original application of rapid prototyping has been complemented with a large number of new applications that take advantage of the excellent characteristics of the latest devices. High speed, very large number of components, large number of supported protocols, and the addition of ready- to-use intellectual property cores make programmable devices the preferred choice of implementation and even deployment in mass production quantities. This paper surveys the advanced features, design tools, and application domains for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The main characteristics and structure of modern FPGAs are first described to show their versatility and abundance of available design resources. Software resources are also discussed, as they are the main enablers for the efficient exploitation of the design capabilities of these devices. Current application domains are described, such as configurable computing, dynamically reconfigurable systems, rapid system prototyping, communication processors and interfaces, and signal processing. This paper also presents the authors' prospective view of how FPGAs will evolve to enter new application domains in the future.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04265777.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Features, Design Tools, and Application Domains of FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4265777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4265777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Features, Design Tools, and Application Domains of FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4265777/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Features, Design Tools, and Application Domains of FPGAs","sourcePdf":"54tie04-rodriguezandina.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135595S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"283","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4265777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4265864,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

In this paper, we first study the capacities of MIMO systems, having different antenna assignments between the transmitter and receiver, and propose an optimum assignment from the viewpoint of maximizing the channel capacity. Considering the selections at both transmitter and receiver, the combined antenna selection algorithm is proposed based on the norm and correlation between rows and columns of the channel matrix. The proposed selection requires low computational complexity because of avoiding matrix operations. Simulation analysis and comparisons indicate that its performance is very close to the optimum combined selection, better than the optimum selection only at the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266020/4266021/04266069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Antenna Selection Algorithm in MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Radio frequency","Costs","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","computational complexity","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined antenna selection algorithm","MIMO systems","channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output","systems complexity","RF chains cost","antenna assignments","channel matrix","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","receive","transmit","combined selection","channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Antenna Selection Algorithm in MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9867133","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Antenna Selection Algorithm in MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMMT-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044367S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266020","isNumber":"4266021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266020","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4266021","articleId":"4266069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4266117,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Ding","id":"37557118700"},{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Xin","lastName":"Chu","id":"37285768100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1048-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266117","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectrics","Integral equations","Maxwell equations","Taylor series","Permittivity","Magnetic fields","Tellurium","Microstrip filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","finite difference time-domain analysis","integral equations","Maxwell equations","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order FDTD","dielectric interfaces","integral form","Maxwell curl equations","Taylor series","continuous fields component","nonuniform grid","permittivities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD","second order accuracy","dielectric interface","three dimension case","nonuniform grid"]}],"abstract":"The second order accurate FDTD techniques at the dielectric interface is applied to the case of three dimension through the integral form of Maxwell's curl equations in the nonuniform grids and Taylor series extending of continuous fields component over finite volumes including the interface.

The timing jitter is a key concern and it's widely investigated in the published literatures. However, most of the issues mainly focused on the clock jitter with white Gaussian noise only. This paper present a more realistic analog-to-digital conversion analysis model based on the actual circuit noise conditions, particularly investigating on the clock jitter error with the combination of Gauss distribution noise and circuit noise (interference). An analytical expression for the A/D conversion with the combined clock jitter error is developed. The computer simulations are presented, which showed excellent agreement with the developed expression. Also, a real experiment brings forth a comprehensive evaluation in IF digitization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit noise","Sampling methods","Clocks","Software radio","Analog-digital conversion","Gaussian noise","Computer errors","Timing jitter","Gaussian distribution","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","circuit noise","Gaussian noise","radiofrequency interference","signal sampling","software radio","timing jitter","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise effect","sampling clock","software radio IF digitization","analog-to-digital conversion","timing jitter","white Gaussian noise","clock jitter error","Gauss distribution noise","circuit interference","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","clock jitter","signal-to-noise ratio","software radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381413","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266020/4266021/04266172.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Noise Effect on Sampling Clock in Software Radio IF Digitization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Noise Effect on Sampling Clock in Software Radio IF Digitization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266172/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266172/","accessionNumber":"9867232","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Noise Effect on Sampling Clock in Software Radio IF Digitization","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMMT-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043575S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266020","isNumber":"4266021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266020","xplore-issue":"4266021","articleId":"4266172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4266190,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Shuicheng","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Shuicheng","id":"37087034613"},{"name":"Wang Zhigong","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhigong","id":"37421692600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1048-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266190","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"abstract":"In this paper, the available gain of 7.7dB with bandwidth over 80GHz distributed amplifier based on OMMIC 0.15 \u03bcm GaAs PHEMT is presented.

In order to compensate the distortion caused by PA, it is necessary to obtain the PA's AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics with the latter difficult to track. In this paper, we propose two effective approaches for measuring the above two characteristics of PA. Based on the measured data, the compensation introduced by look-up table (LUT) predistorter can be evaluated by computer simulation. By eliminating the signal distortion and spectral regrowth, good linearization is achieved by this LUT technique, and it becomes better with the increase of LUT size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4266217/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9867275","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LUT Predistortion Based On Measured Non-Linear Characteristics of Power Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LUT Predistortion Based On Measured Non-Linear Characteristics of Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMMT-00-196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047924S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266020","isNumber":"4266021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266020","xplore-issue":"4266021","articleId":"4266217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4266226,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-dong Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37697526000"},{"name":"Jia-you Song","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jia-you","lastName":"Song","id":"37595970400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1048-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266226","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"abstract":"This paper presents a design and optimization method for low noise amplifiers (LNAs), based on the minimization of the noise figure for a given power consumption.

Digital baseband predistortion is a highly cost-effective way to linearize Power amplifiers (PAs), but most existing architectures assume that the PA has a memoryless nonlinearity. For wider bandwidth applications such as wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA) or wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (W-OFDM),PA memory effects can no longer be ignored. In this paper we proposed a new technique for adaptation of digital predistorter that considers memory effects in power amplifiers. This new technique is validated by using a 1.9 GHz 85 W LDMOS power amplifier and various signals such as 3-carrier CDMA and IS95 CDMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplifiers Linearization Based on Digital Predistortion with Memory Effects Used in CDMA","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381487","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266020/4266021/04266246.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplifiers Linearization Based on Digital Predistortion with Memory Effects Used in CDMA","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266246/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9867301","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplifiers Linearization Based on Digital Predistortion with Memory Effects Used in CDMA","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMMT-00-225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043303S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266020","isNumber":"4266021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4266021","articleId":"4266246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4266258,"authors":[{"name":"Huadong Sun","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37693787000"},{"name":"Fulin Su","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fulin","lastName":"Su","id":"37592077400"},{"name":"Weiyi Wang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Weiyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37696486000"},{"name":"Shouhe Tang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shouhe","lastName":"Tang","id":"37686853200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1048-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266258","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Fourier transforms","Azimuth","Object detection","Chirp","Signal analysis","Focusing","Frequency estimation","Radar detection","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","parameter estimation","radar detection","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","moving targets","airborne SAR","fractional Fourier transform","one-aperture radar system","signal-to-noise ratio conditions","cross-term interference"]}],"abstract":"Fractional Fourier transform was used in this paper to realize the localization and velocity estimations in both directions, ground range direction and azimuth direction, when it comes to a one-aperture radar system.

However, the performance of the OFDM scheme is severely affected by the phase noise of the oscillators at the receiver. The modulation error rate (MER) is widely applied as a measure of OFDM signals' performance which integrates impairments such as nonlinearity, IQ imbalance, phase noise as well as Doppler frequency shift. In this paper, we investigate the effects induced on the OFDM signals by Wiener phase noise, and propose analytical equations for MER calculation. Theoretical results show perfect agreement with those obtained by simulation and they can be used to predict the MER degradation of OFDM system and choose suitable oscillators with no need to run extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381517","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266020/4266021/04266276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MER performance analysis of M-QAM-OFDM with Wiener phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266276/","displayDocTitle":"MER performance analysis of M-QAM-OFDM with Wiener phase noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9867329","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266276/","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MER performance analysis of M-QAM-OFDM with Wiener phase noise","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMMT-00-255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035638S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266020","isNumber":"4266021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4266021","articleId":"4266276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4266370,"authors":[{"name":"Aminghasem Safarian","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aminghasem","lastName":"Safarian","id":"37270079800"},{"name":"Amin Shameli","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Shameli","id":"37294656000"},{"name":"Ahmadreza Rofougaran","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmadreza","lastName":"Rofougaran","id":"37275528900"},{"name":"Maryam Rofougaran","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Rofougaran","id":"37294655200"},{"name":"Franco de Flaviis","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"de Flaviis","id":"37281511900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0530-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0531-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"4266370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":1140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266370","abstract":"This paper presents integrated blocker filtering RF front-ends (BF-RF). In wireless cellular systems the blockers are from either self transmitters, such as WCDMA or form the other users' transmitters such as GSM. The proposed blocker filtering deploys the concept of blocker injection through feedforward or feedback paths to create arbitrary narrowband notches for the out-of-band blockers, while not affecting the gain of the desired signal. The BF-RF obviates the use of the off-chip SAW filters. Fabricated in a 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology the prototype achieves a 50dB of signal to blocker ratio.

This technology can potentially reduce cost, size, and improve performance for applications associated with high-speed communications, automotive collision avoidance and navigation, and homeland security weapons detection. Measured results of DC, S-parameter, and responsivity measurements in the 60 GHz band will be presented, including unmatched responsivity at 60 GHz of over 1000 V/W at -20 dBm, which is competitive with detector diodes on GaAs or Sb-based materials.

The main goal is to create a re-configurable radio architecture accepting all the cellular or non-cellular standards working in the 0-5 GHz frequency range. But, in this environment, the analog to digital conversion and the digital operations face issues like power supply and processing speed. The idea is to interface a preprocessing circuit between the antenna and a digital signal processor (DSP) to pre-condition the RF signal. This paper presents the design of an analog discrete-time device located between antenna and a DSP in standard radio architecture. It uses the principle of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to reduce the frequency of the DSP-input-signal treatment to fulfil the SDR purpose.

In the proposed PLL, both an improved multi-modulus (MM) divider and an adaptive four-band LC VCO are depicted. The MM divider provides division ratios of 6 to 455 depending on the division mode of the six-mode prescaler. The LC VCO generates four bands of oscillation frequencies covering 9.1-11.6 GHz, including an adaptive cross-coupled MOS array. The cross-coupled MOS array was devised to reduce the area of the capacitor array and compensate for the oscillation power. The PLL achieves phase noises of -98 dBc/Hz from 11.4 GHz and -102 dBc/Hz from 9.61 GHz, at an offset of 980 kHz. The PLL consumes 32 mA at 1.2 V.

An analysis on a simple equivalent circuit of RFID tag chip for long reading range is presented taking into account the finite turn-on voltage of tag chip. The Schottky diodes used in the passive RFID tag chip were fabricated using Titanium (Ti/Al/Ta/Al)-Silicon (n-type) junction in 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process, and the effect of size of Schottky diode on the turn-on voltage and the input impedance of the voltage multiplier was investigated. For 300 mV RF input voltage, the fabricated voltage multiplier using Schottky diodes generated output voltages of 1.5 V and corresponding voltage conversion efficiency of 45%.

It is used in an 802.11abgn FEM (Front End Module) which further integrates the antenna diplexer, LNA post filters, PA pre-filters, and baluns. The LNAs provide less than 1.2dB noise figure in the 2.4/5-6GHz receive chains at 16dB gain and 10mA. The switches can handle up to 30dBm peak power with less than 1.4dB loss and with 25dB isolation. The power amplifier section provides fully matched 26dB gain with 25dBm of saturated power. In the 802.11g 2.4GHz transmit mode the MMIC gives over 20dBm linear power out under 54Mbps OFDM, at 4% EVM, while drawing only 123mA of peak current. In the 802.11a 5-6 GHz transmit mode the MMIC gives over 20dBm linear power out under 54 Mbps OFDM, at 6% EVM while drawing 149mA of peak current. The MMIC has integrated all control functions for power down and mode select; while the power amplifiers have integrated directional couplers and temperature compensated power detection.

The VCO system is fully integrated and suitable to operate in GSM base station synthesizers. The challenges and requirements for this application will be discussed and the possibility of achieving the performance of the oscillator will be demonstrated. The topology of the VCO core is a varactor tuned Colpitts oscillator which achieves a phase noise of -148 dBc/Hz at 1.8 MHz offset frequency. A 130 nm RF-CMOS process was used for the implementation. The process supports thick oxide devices for higher breakdown voltages. These transistors were chosen in order to obtain the highest possible voltage swing in the VCO core.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2007.380911","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266345/4266346/04266459.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2007.380911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Colpitts Oscillator Design for a GSM Base Station Synthesizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266459/","displayDocTitle":"A Colpitts Oscillator Design for a GSM Base Station Synthesizer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9809362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266459/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Colpitts Oscillator Design for a GSM Base Station Synthesizer","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"RFIC-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076517S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266345","isNumber":"4266346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266345","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4266346","articleId":"4266459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266462,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu Hwan An","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyu Hwan","lastName":"An","id":"37305827000"},{"name":"Younsuk Kim","affiliation":["Samsung RFIC Design Center, Atlanta, GA 30308, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Younsuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37697012300"},{"name":"Ockgoo Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ockgoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37266832400"},{"name":"Ki Seok Yang","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ki Seok","lastName":"Yang","id":"37832875000"},{"name":"Hyungwook Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyungwook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310769700"},{"name":"Wangmyong Woo","affiliation":["Samsung RFIC Design Center, Atlanta, GA 30308, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Wangmyong","lastName":"Woo","id":"37302022100"},{"name":"Jae Joon Chang","affiliation":["Samsung RFIC Design Center, Atlanta, GA 30308, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jae Joon","lastName":"Chang","id":"37351088300"},{"name":"Chang-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Samsung RFIC Design Center, Atlanta, GA 30308, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Chang-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280404200"},{"name":"Haksun Kim","affiliation":["Samsung RFIC Design Center, Atlanta, GA 30308, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Haksun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292767500"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0530-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0531-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"4266462","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1041},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS technology","Radio frequency","Power generation","Integrated circuit technology","Power supplies","Power measurement","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Substrates","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","monolithic integrated circuits","potential transformers","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithic voltage-boosting parallel-primary transformer structures","fully integrated CMOS power amplifier design","interweaved structure","power combining method","power added efficiency","size 0.18 mum","power 1.3 W","resistance 50 ohm","voltage 3.3 V","frequency 1.8 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage-boosting","parallel-primary","transformer","CMOS","power amplifier"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel monolithic voltage-boosting parallel-primary transformer is presented for the fully integrated CMOS power amplifier design.

To facilitate low-voltage operation with 0.8-1.2-V supply, the mixer employs a folded Gilbert cell topology with PMOS devices for LO switches and utilizes on-chip broadband RF chokes for biasing. The folded toplogy allows the transconductance and LO stages to have different bias current. By setting the bias current in the PMOS switches near zero, the mixer DC offset due to device mismatch is greatly reduced The effect of supply voltage on the mixer performance is studied. The mixer consumes 2.5 and 5.8 mW from a 0.8-V and 1.2-V supply, respectively. Under a 1.2-V supply, the mixer achieves a voltage conversion gain (CG) of 5.3-8.2 dB, a single-sideband noise figure (NF) of 9.6-13.5dB, a second-order intermodualtion intercept point (IIP2) of 37.3-43.4dBm, and a third-order intermodualtion intercept point (IIP3) of -3.2 to -0.3 dBm between 3-7 GHz. The DC offset of the mixer is measured systematically to isolate the contributions due to device mismatch, LO self-mixing, and second-order intermodulation. The typical measured DC offset ranges from 2.4 to 4.3 mV.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2007.380930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2007.380930","startPage":"489","endPage":"492","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266345/4266346/04266478.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.2-V, 5.8-mW, Ultra-Wideband Folded Mixer in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 1.2-V, 5.8-mW, Ultra-Wideband Folded Mixer in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266478/","accessionNumber":"9833252","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266478/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.2-V, 5.8-mW, Ultra-Wideband Folded Mixer in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"RFIC-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043298S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266345","isNumber":"4266346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266345","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4266346","articleId":"4266478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4266487,"authors":[{"name":"Brian A.

The HPA utilizes a novel distributed broadband class-E load topology to maintain a simultaneous high PAE and output Power over (6-12 GHz). The HPA's peak PAE and output power performance measured under three pulsed drain voltages at 7.5 GHz are: (67%, 36.8 dBm @ 20 V), (64%, 37.8 dBm @ 25 V) and (58%, 38.3 dBm @ 30 V). The new broadband load also provides a spectrally pure output power response under CW and pulsed modulated RF input conditions. The HPA spurious free performance is evident from its low AM and PM noise figures of <-125 dBc at 10 KHz from carrier and <-130 dBc at 15 KHz from 10 GHz respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest ever reported performance for a high power, 6-12 GHz GaN class-E power amplifier.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","High power amplifiers","Power generation","Pulse measurements","Pulse modulation","Broadband amplifiers","Aluminum gallium nitride","HEMTs","Topology","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","power amplifiers","power HEMT","semiconductor device noise","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband monolithic class-E power amplifier","field-plated HEMT","distributed broadband class-E load topology","output power response","noise figures","frequency 6 GHz to 12 GHz","frequency 10 kHz","voltage 20 V","voltage 25 V","voltage 30 V","frequency 15 kHz","AlGaN-GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband Class E amplifiers","GaN monolithic power amplifiers","high efficiency amplifiers","Broadband class-E load","Avionics radar technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2007.380951","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266345/4266346/04266499.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2007.380951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrally pure 5.0 W, High PAE, (6-12 GHz) GaN Monolithic Class E Power Amplifier for Advanced T/R Modules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrally pure 5.0 W, High PAE, (6-12 GHz) GaN Monolithic Class E Power Amplifier for Advanced T/R Modules","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266499/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266499/","accessionNumber":"9809391","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrally pure 5.0 W, High PAE, (6-12 GHz) GaN Monolithic Class E Power Amplifier for Advanced T/R Modules","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"RFIC-00-153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151374S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4266345","isNumber":"4266346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266345","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4266346","articleId":"4266499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4266500,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin W.

A linearized RF variable gain amplifier is proposed for low power operation. Isolation of over 40dB is obtained by equipping separate GNDs on both the MIMO IC and the circuit board. This results in negligible degradation of EVM. TX EVM of over -31dB is obtained at -8.6 dBm for 2 TX mode when external LO of 10GHz is applied.

Reducing the number of non-zero coefficients optimizes the implementation process especially when dealing with high order filters and when using lookup table (LUT) based techniques such as distributed arithmetic (DA).

The multiplier-less architecture uses shift- and-add operations to realize the complex multiplier and uses the CSD to optimize these operations. The design has been coded in Verilog HDL targeting Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA series. It is fully implemented and tested on real hardware using Virtex-II FG456 prototype board. Based on this architecture, the implementation of 8-points FFT on Virtex-II can run at a maximum clock frequency of about 400 MHz which lead to about 3.2 GS/s throughput with a latency of 6 clock cycles using 16,580 equivalent gates. Comparison with a conventional parallel architecture design of the same size can run only at a maximum clock frequency of 220 MHz or 1.76 GS/s throughput with a latency of 12 clock cycles using 77,418 equivalent gates for the design. The resulting throughput increases by about 82% while the equivalent gates and latency decrease by about 79% and 50% respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a Canonical Signed Digit Multiplier-less based FFT Processor for Wireless Communication Applications","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380712","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266544/4266545/04266695.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a Canonical Signed Digit Multiplier-less based FFT Processor for Wireless Communication Applications","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266695/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9892786","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of a Canonical Signed Digit Multiplier-less based FFT Processor for Wireless Communication Applications","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SMELEC-00-150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051278S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4266544","isNumber":"4266545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266544","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4266545","articleId":"4266695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266698,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Meaamar","affiliation":["VLSI Design Center, Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Meaamar","id":"37680604100"},{"name":"Masuri Bin Othman","affiliation":["VLSI Design Center, Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Masuri Bin","lastName":"Othman","id":"37286262700"},{"name":"Omid Shoaei","affiliation":["University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Shoaei","id":"37273887600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9730-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9731-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1838},"abstract":"A fully differential, high gain opamp to be used in a low-voltage low-power high speed pipeline analog to digital converter (ADC) in a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process is designed.

The theoretical circuit analysis along with the experimental study validates the proposed circuit operation.","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380728","startPage":"708","endPage":"712","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266544/4266545/04266711.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realisation of a Differential Multiplier-Divider based on Current Feedback Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Realisation of a Differential Multiplier-Divider based on Current Feedback Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266711/","accessionNumber":"9882459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266711/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realisation of a Differential Multiplier-Divider based on Current Feedback Amplifiers","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SMELEC-00-166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043975S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4266544","isNumber":"4266545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4266544","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4266545","articleId":"4266711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4266718,"authors":[{"name":"Sharifah Fatmadiana","affiliation":["Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sharifah","lastName":"Fatmadiana","id":"37088283431"},{"name":"Wan Muhamad Hatta","affiliation":["Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wan Muhamad","lastName":"Hatta","id":"37088287140"},{"name":"Norhayati Soin","affiliation":["Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norhayati","lastName":"Soin","id":"37320860700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9730-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9731-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4266718","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1065},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Wireless communication","Resistors","Circuit simulation","Impedance","Circuit topology","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF BJT-low noise amplifier","low-voltage application","bipolar junction transistor","power dissipation","noise figure","MultiSim9","radio frequency","frequency 1 GHz","gain 3.296 dB","loss -6.68 dB","noise figure 0.359 dB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266718","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2006.380735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266545","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4266544/4266545/04266718.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an RF BJT-Low Noise Amplifier at 1GHz","abstract":"A fully-integrated RF Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) suitable for low-voltage applications is proposed using bipolar junction transistors (BJT) cascaded stages.

The growing complexity of building systems has become a major challenge for field technicians to troubleshoot the problems manually; this calls for automated ldquosmart-service systemsrdquo for performing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The focus of this paper is to develop a generic FDD scheme for centrifugal chillers and also to develop a nominal data-driven (ldquoblack-boxrdquo) model of the chiller that can predict the system response under new loading conditions. In this vein, support vector machines, principal component analysis, and partial least squares are the candidate fault classification techniques in our approach. We present a genetic algorithm-based approach to select a sensor suite for maximum diagnosabilty and also evaluated the performance of selected classification procedures with the optimized sensor suite. The responses of these selected sensors are predicted under new loading conditions using the nominal model developed via the black-box modeling approach. We used the benchmark data on a 90-t real centrifugal chiller test equipment, provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, to demonstrate and validate our proposed diagnostic procedure. The database consists of data from sixty four monitored variables of the chiller under 27 different modes of operation during nominal and eight faulty conditions with different severities.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2006.888053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2006.888053","startPage":"469","endPage":"473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4266804/04266818.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling, Fault Diagnosis and Optimal Sensor Selection for HVAC Chillers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling, Fault Diagnosis and Optimal Sensor Selection for HVAC Chillers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266818/","accessionNumber":"9607563","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266818/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Modeling, Fault Diagnosis and Optimal Sensor Selection for HVAC Chillers","sourcePdf":"04tase03-namburu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076375S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4266804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4266804","articleId":"4266818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4266825,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Pillarisetti","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/4266804/4266825/4266825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anand Pillarisetti (S'06) received the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering and mechanics from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, in 2006.

These methods do not have the ability to provide force feedback to an operator. Poor control of cell injection force is one of the primary reasons for low success rates in cell injection and transgenesis in particular. Therefore, there exists a need to incorporate force feedback into a cell injection system. We have developed a force feedback interface, which has the capability of measuring forces in the range of and provide a haptic display of the cell injection forces in real time. Using this force feedback interface, we performed several human factors studies to evaluate the effect of force feedback on cell injection outcomes. We tested our system with 40 human subjects and our experimental results indicate that the subjects were able to feel the cell injection force and confirmed our research hypothesis that the use of combined vision and force feedback leads to a higher success rate in cell injection task compared to using vision feedback alone.","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4266804/04266825.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2006.888051","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2006.888051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force feedback","Biological cells","Cells (biology)","Force control","Force measurement","Haptic interfaces","Displays","Performance evaluation","Human factors","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","biomedical engineering","cellular biophysics","force feedback","human factors","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell injection","biological cell manipulation","molecular biology","transgenesis","force feedback interface","human factors studies","vision feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell injection","force feedback","human factors studies","transgenesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the Effect of Force Feedback in Cell Injection","accessionNumber":"9605845","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4266825/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the Effect of Force Feedback in Cell Injection","sourcePdf":"04tase03-pillarisetti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087891S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4266804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4266804","articleId":"4266825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4266836,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The measurement includes deembedding to the coplanar waveguide input of the chip. The noise was measured at a variety of bias conditions and found to be a minimum of 7.5 dB. The gain of the chip is measured to be 11.4 dB, consistent with -parameter measurements of the same device. This is the highest frequency measurement of noise of a monolithic microwave integrated circuit amplifier and the only known on-wafer measurement of noise at this frequency. The measurement demonstrates that wafer probe techniques developed at lower frequencies can be applied to circuits at submillimeter wavelengths.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.899324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266829","startPage":"546","endPage":"548","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4266829/04266836.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.899324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of a 270 GHz Low Noise Amplifier With 7.5 dB Noise Figure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise figure","Noise measurement","Low-noise amplifiers","Semiconductor device measurement","Integrated circuit measurements","Integrated circuit noise","Wavelength measurement","Frequency measurement","Gain measurement","Coplanar waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","electric noise measurement","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency 270 GHz","noise figure 7.5 dB","gain 11.4 dB","low noise amplifier","noise measurement","wafer probe techniques","coplanar waveguide deembedding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low noise amplifier (LNA)","MM-wave","monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","noise measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of a 270 GHz Low Noise Amplifier With 7.5 dB Noise Figure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4266836/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9598983","publicationDate":"July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of a 270 GHz Low Noise Amplifier With 7.5 dB Noise Figure","sourcePdf":"17lmwc07-gaier.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054423S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4266829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4266829","articleId":"4266836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4266837,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Gonzalez","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37273637400"},{"name":"Jos A.

This letter proposes the combination of the two-port lumped-network FDTD method and rational-fitting techniques to incorporate linear active devices characterized by measured 5-parameters into FDTD simulators. To this end, first the Y-parameters are obtained, which are then approximated by rational functions of the frequency over the band of interest. The polynomial coefficients resulting from the rational fitting are directly used to feed the FDTD simulation. The approach proposed here is applied to the calculation of the S-parameters of a microstrip amplifier. The results obtained are compared with those provided by the commercial simulator advanced design system and with measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4266829/04266837.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.899292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.899292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining the FDTD Method and Rational-Fitting Techniques for Modeling Active Devices Characterized by Measured --Parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Circuit simulation","Frequency measurement","Manufacturing","Fitting","Microwave devices","Microwave circuits","Equivalent circuits","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","equivalent circuits","finite difference time-domain analysis","lumped parameter networks","semiconductor device models","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD method","rational fitting techniques","modeling active devices","S-parameters","finite difference time domain","equivalent circuit model","linear active devices","Y-parameters","polynomial coefficients","microstrip amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active devices","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","lumped networks (LNs)","rational fitting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Combining the FDTD Method and Rational-Fitting Techniques for Modeling Active Devices Characterized by Measured <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$S$</tex> </formula>-Parameters","volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4266837/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9597602","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining the FDTD Method and Rational-Fitting Techniques for Modeling Active Devices Characterized by Measured <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$S$</tex> </formula>-Parameters","sourcePdf":"17lmwc07-gonzalez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04973S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4266829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4266829","articleId":"4266837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266853,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hwa Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hwa","lastName":"Wu","id":"37576290500"},{"name":"Chi-Hsueh Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hsueh","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280022100"},{"name":"Chun Hsiung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun Hsiung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351222600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4266853","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1736},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Resonator filters","Passband","Impedance","Magnetic separation","Frequency response","Feeds","Coupling circuits","System-on-a-chip","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","band-stop filters","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential-mode passband","common-mode stopbands","differential-mode stopbands","common-mode rejection","fourth-order balanced bandpass filter","coupled stepped-impedance resonators","stopband-extended balanced bandpass filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balanced filter (BPF)","coupled-resonator BPF","stepped-impedance resonator (SIR)","stopband extension"]}],"abstract":"A novel fourth-order balanced bandpass filter is proposed based on the half-wavelength (lambda/2) stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs).

We first derive the new QKF for nonlinear systems with additive Gaussian noise by linearizing the process and measurement functions using statistical linear regression (SLR) through a set of Gauss-Hermite quadrature points that parameterize the Gaussian density. Moreover, we discuss how the new QKF can be extended and modified to take into account specific details of a given application. We then go on to extend the use of the new QKF to discrete-time, nonlinear systems with additive, possibly non-Gaussian noise. A bank of parallel QKFs, called the Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter (GS-QKF) approximates the predicted and posterior densities as a finite number of weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The weights are obtained from the residuals of the QKFs. Three different Gaussian mixture reduction techniques are presented to alleviate the growing number of the Gaussian sum terms inherent to the GS-QKFs. Simulation results exhibit a significant improvement of the GS-QKFs over other nonlinear filtering approaches, namely, the basic bootstrap (particle) filters and Gaussian-sum extended Kalman filters, to solve nonlinear non- Gaussian filtering problems.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.894705","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4266867/04266868.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.894705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-Time Nonlinear Filtering Algorithms Using Gauss\u2013Hermite Quadrature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266868","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-Time Nonlinear Filtering Algorithms Using Gauss\u2013Hermite Quadrature","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266868/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9600581","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266868/","volume":"95","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-Time Nonlinear Filtering Algorithms Using Gauss\u2013Hermite Quadrature","sourcePdf":"95jproc05-arasaratnam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154238S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4266867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"350","xplore-issue":"4266867","articleId":"4266868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4266870,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Cappe","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4266867/4266870/4266870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Capp\u00e9 was born in Villeurbanne, France, in 1968.

However, real trajectories of objects are typically characterized by prolonged smooth sections, with sharp, but infrequent, changes. Thus, a more parsimonious representation of a target trajectory may be obtained by direct modeling of maneuver times in the state process, independently from the observation times. This is achieved by assuming the state arrival times to follow a random process, typically specified as Markovian, so that state points may be allocated along the trajectory according to the degree of variation observed. The resulting variable dimension state inference problem is solved by developing an efficient variable rate particle filtering algorithm to recursively update the posterior distribution of the state sequence as new data becomes available. The methodology is quite general and can be applied across many models where dynamic model uncertainty occurs on-line. Specific models are proposed for the dynamics of a moving object under internal forcing, expressed in terms of the intrinsic dynamics of the object. The performance of the algorithms with these dynamical models is demonstrated on several challenging maneuvering target tracking problems in clutter.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.894708","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4266867/04266878.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.894708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models and Algorithms for Tracking of Maneuvering Objects Using Variable Rate Particle Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266878","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266878/","displayDocTitle":"Models and Algorithms for Tracking of Maneuvering Objects Using Variable Rate Particle Filters","volume":"95","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9597579","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266878/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models and Algorithms for Tracking of Maneuvering Objects Using Variable Rate Particle Filters","sourcePdf":"95jproc05-godsill.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101326S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4266867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4266867","articleId":"4266878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266879,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Habibi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Habibi","id":"37340079400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"4266879","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1432},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> In this paper, a new method for state estimation, referred to as the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF), is presented. The SVSF method is model based and applies to smooth nonlinear dynamic systems. It allows for the explicit definition of the source of uncertainty and can guarantee stability given an upper bound for uncertainties and noise levels. The performance of the SVSF improves with more refined definition of upper bounds on parameter variations or uncertainties. Furthermore, most filtering methods provide as their measure of performance the filter innovation vector or (output) estimation error. However in addition to the innovation vector, the SVSF has a secondary set of performance indicators that correlate to the modeling errors specific to each state or parameter that is being estimated. The combined robustness and multiple indicators of performance allow for dynamic refinement of internal models in the SVSF. Dynamic refinement and robustness are features that are particularly advantageous in fault diagnosis and prediction. In this paper, the applications of the SVSF to linear and nonlinear systems, including one pertaining to fault detection, are provided. The characteristics of this filter in terms of its accuracy and rate of convergence are discussed. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","State estimation","Upper bound","Technological innovation","Robustness","Stability","Noise level","Filtering","Estimation error","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","filtering theory","nonlinear dynamical systems","robust control","state estimation","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","robustness","filter innovation vector","nonlinear dynamic systems","state estimation","SVSF","smooth variable structure filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","filtering","sliding mode control","variable structure systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.893255","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4266867/04266879.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.893255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Smooth Variable Structure Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266879","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Smooth Variable Structure Filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266879/","volume":"95","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9598959","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Smooth Variable Structure Filter","sourcePdf":"95jproc05-habibi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076117S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4266867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"118","articleId":"4266879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4266880,"authors":[{"name":"Marija D.

Sensor management, as defined here, is the process of dynamically retasking agile sensors in response to an evolving environment. Sensors may be agile in a variety of ways, e.g., the ability to reposition, point an antenna, choose sensing mode, or waveform. The goal of sensor management in a large network is to choose actions for individual sensors dynamically so as to maximize overall network utility. Sensor management in the multiplatform setting is a challenging problem for several reasons. First, the state space required to characterize an environment is typically of very high dimension and poorly represented by a parametric form. Second, the network must simultaneously address a number of competing goals. Third, the number of potential taskings grows exponentially with the number of sensors. Finally, in low-communication environments, decentralized methods are required. The approach we present in this paper addresses these challenges through a novel combination of particle filtering for nonparametric density estimation, information theory for comparing actions, and physicomimetics for computational tractability. The efficacy of the method is illustrated in a realistic surveillance application by simulation, where an unknown number of ground targets are detected and tracked by a network of mobile sensors.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.893247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266867","startPage":"978","endPage":"999","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4266867/04266881.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.893247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Information-Based Approach to Sensor Management in Large Dynamic Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor phenomena and characterization","Environmental management","Utility programs","State-space methods","Filtering theory","Information filtering","Information filters","Estimation theory","Information theory","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","particle filtering (numerical methods)","sensor arrays","sensor fusion","surveillance","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile sensor network","realistic surveillance","computational tractability","physicomimetics","information theory","nonparametric density estimation","particle filtering","low-communication environments","potential taskings","multiplatform setting","network utility","agile sensors","large dynamic networks","sensor management","information-based approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information theory","joint multitarget probability density","multiplatform sensor management","multitarget tracking","particle filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Information-Based Approach to Sensor Management in Large Dynamic Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","volume":"95","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9596762","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information-Based Approach to Sensor Management in Large Dynamic Networks","sourcePdf":"95jproc05-kreucher.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052735S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4266867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"90","articleId":"4266881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4266897,"authors":[{"name":"Min-an Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266897/4266897-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min-An Song was born in 1966 in Taipei, Taiwan.

The real-time constraint of codec leads to a heavy computational bottleneck on today's data storage devices. To overcome this problem, design analysis and optimization of Reed Solomon code are addressed at the algorithmic level. First, the dominant calculation of spreading function is replaced with small look- , up tables. Second, a method which greatly reduces the number of multipliers in performing the multiplication operations of the codec process is proposed to reduce the RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) system codec complexity while maintaining the quality. Moreover, our algorithm can be expanded to correct multiple failed disks. Therefore, the failed data in disks can be recovered and system still can work as usual without broken. This technique is different from the traditional methods. The proposed design could be implemented in a real-time Reed Solomon codec RAID system with reduction of hardware complexity by 28%. A hybrid strategy considering both data layout and load of storage nodes has a 13-25% higher I/O performance than conventional RS RAID.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266897.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Design of Reed Solomon Code Algorithm for Advanced RAID System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266897/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Design of Reed Solomon Code Algorithm for Advanced RAID System","volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9617557","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266897/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Design of Reed Solomon Code Algorithm for Advanced RAID System","sourcePdf":"p265-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063237S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4266898,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojin Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Technology, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266898/4266898-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojin Li was born in China in 1978.

In 1997, OFDM was officially sanctioned for use in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) EN 300 744 standard known as digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T). As OFDM is such a popular technology, there has been limited research over the years into alternatives. This paper proposes a novel approach to transmit parallel information through a terrestrial channel that could render it a more flexible alternative to OFDM in the future. Investigations have shown that this technique could provide a highly flexible, channel optimized modulation technique based on time-frequency multiplexing and this paper presents the preliminary phase of investigations into this new technique .","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266899.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplex: An Alternative to OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266899/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplex: An Alternative to OFDM","volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9621433","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266899/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplex: An Alternative to OFDM","sourcePdf":"p278-linfoot.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051713S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4266900,"authors":[{"name":"Pilar M.

However, the pilot-Aided channel estimation techniques in CP-OFDM cannot be applied to TDS-OFDM. In this paper, channel impulse responses are estimated in time domain based on the linear correlation between the received samples and the locally generated PN sequence. The iterative threshold detection (ITD), as well as the combination with decision feedback equalization (DFE), is proposed to improve the precision of channel estimation. It is shown by simulation that the proposed algorithm, ITD combined with DFE (ITD-DFE), performs very well even in multipath environments with long- delay and large-amplitude echoes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266905.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ITD-DFE Based Channel Estimation and Equalization in TDS-OFDM Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Head","AWGN","Frequency synchronization","Convolution","Baseband","Sampling methods","Binary phase shift keying","OFDM modulation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","receivers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ITD-DFE","channel estimation","equalization","TDS-OFDM receivers","time-domain synchronous OFDM","spectrum efficiency","channel impulse responses","PN sequence","iterative threshold detection","decision feedback equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"ITD-DFE Based Channel Estimation and Equalization in TDS-OFDM Receivers","volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4266905/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9676845","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ITD-DFE Based Channel Estimation and Equalization in TDS-OFDM Receivers","sourcePdf":"p304 liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078163S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4266908,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266908/4266908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wan-Jin Kim received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Pusan National University, Busan, Korea, in 2005.

Since the noncoherent differential demodulation of existing T-DMB receivers can not track channel variation, it may not work well in fast-fading channels. To overcome this problem, coherent detection based on channel estimation is introduced. The proposed method re- modulates the output of the soft-decision Viterbi decoder for coded DD channel estimation to obtain more accurate decision symbols than hard-decision symbols. To both mitigate the effects of noise and smooth incorrectly-estimated coefficients, the estimated channel coefficients are two- dimensionally averaged. The enhanced accuracy leads to the high-performance DQPSK demodulation robust to Doppler spread and noise. The proposed method may also contribute to the launch of the future T-DMB service of providing a higher data rate. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs much better than the conventional method, especially at high speed-moving receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","startPage":"319","endPage":"326","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266908.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for Coherent Detection in Terrestrial DMB Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Demodulation","OFDM","Noise reduction","Fading","Multimedia communication","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","channel estimation","demodulation","fading channels","multimedia communication","quadrature phase shift keying","receivers","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded decision-directed channel estimation","coherent detection","terrestrial DMB receivers","two-dimensional averaging","noncoherent differential demodulation","fast-fading channels","soft-decision Viterbi decoder","high-performance DQPSK demodulation","Doppler spread","Doppler noise."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Coded Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for Coherent Detection in Terrestrial DMB Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4266908/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9676846","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for Coherent Detection in Terrestrial DMB Receivers","sourcePdf":"p319-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057688S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4266909,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-hyun Park","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266909/4266909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Hyun Park was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1980.

Most of recent works have focused on minimizing the PAPR of OFDM signal to enhance performance. However, after relating this issue with the specific characteristics of high power amplifier (HPA), we propose a new scheme based on iterative partial transmit sequence (I-PTS) scheme that uses the amount of OFDM signal's nonlinear distortion to be caused by high power amplifier (HPA) as a new measure. The proposed scheme can have simple subblock combining method by applying iterative PTS and then, a new measure which is called adaptive nonlinear estimator (ANE), is achieved by estimating the mean square error (MSE) between the OFDM signals before and after the nonlinear HPA. The one with the minimum MSE among OFDM candidate signals is selected for transmission. From the results, it can be seen that a proposed scheme based-iterative PTS can be easily implemented with low combining complexity, still maintaining a better BER performance, compared to the conventional PTS approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique of OFDM System with Nonlinear High Power Amplifier","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381696","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266909.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique of OFDM System with Nonlinear High Power Amplifier","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4266909/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9612637","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New PAPR Reduction Technique of OFDM System with Nonlinear High Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"p327-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044749S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266911,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-jung An","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266911/4266911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ho-Jung An was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1982.

DMB system allows interference-free reception under the conditions of multipath propagation and transmission errors using coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation (COFDM) and unequal error protection (UEP) scheme. For error correction of portable DMB receivers, punctured convolutional code and viterbi decoder is developed but it needs lots of computations for real-time operation. So, it is desired to design a high speed and low-power hardware scheme for viterbi decoder. This paper proposes a combined add-compare-select (ACS) and path metric normalization (PMN) unit using pre-computation technique for DMB system. The proposed PMN unit reduces the critical path by applying fixed value selection algorithm using the comparison tree properties. We also propose an ACS structure using the decomposition and pre-computation technique for reducing the complexity of the adder, comparator and multiplexer. Simulation results shows that area, gate delay and power consumption are reduced about 3.78%, 23.80%, and 12.22%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381700","startPage":"350","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266913.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power efficient Viterbi decoder based on pre-computation technique for portable digital multimedia broadcasting receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient Viterbi decoder based on pre-computation technique for portable digital multimedia broadcasting receiver","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266913/","accessionNumber":"9617558","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266913/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient Viterbi decoder based on pre-computation technique for portable digital multimedia broadcasting receiver","sourcePdf":"p350-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06574S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4266926,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-=Hoon Kim","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266926/4266926-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jee-Hoon Kim was born in Seoul, Korea in 1982.

On the contrary, recently developed cooperative diversity technique, which profits the transmit diversity only with the existing hardware by constituting a virtual antenna array, can be a solution. However, most of the introduced cooperative techniques have a common fault of decreased transmission rate because the destination should receive the decodable compositions of symbols from the source and the relay. In this paper, we propose an alternative use of hierarchical modulation and a suitable cooperative space-time block code (C-STBC). This technique is free from the rate-loss and allows seamless cooperative communication while similar diversity gain is benefited. The proposed technique is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) for multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) system. Simulation results show that cooperative system based on our technique outperforms noncooperative one when relatively reliable source-to-relay link (S-R link) is guaranteed.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement of Cooperative MB-OFDM System Based Coming Home Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of Cooperative MB-OFDM System Based Coming Home Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9612641","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4266926/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of Cooperative MB-OFDM System Based Coming Home Network","sourcePdf":"p442-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047405S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4266932,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghwan Hyun","affiliation":["School of computer science and engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266932/4266932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seunghwan Hyun received the BS and MS degrees in computer science and engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2000, and 2002, respectively.

By imitating the human path, we propose a human- friendly path planner. Also, the designed planner requires a low amount of computations which not only extends the battery running time but also decreases the hardware cost of the RVC. Experimental results show that the proposed path gives a more favorable impression to customers than conventional paths.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266937.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Path Planner for the Robotic Vacuum Cleaner in Rectilinear Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Path Planner for the Robotic Vacuum Cleaner in Rectilinear Environments","volume":"53","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621442","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4266937/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266937/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Path Planner for the Robotic Vacuum Cleaner in Rectilinear Environments","sourcePdf":"p519-doh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081906S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4266939,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yufei","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266939/4266939-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["LiYufei (B.S.'01-M.S.'03) was born in JiuJiang, JiangXi, P.R.C., in 1979.

These partitions further go though a repartitioning test to ensure the absence of any dominating portions.

The exact calculation of the similarity is one of the key issues for the Y/C separation. We propose new approaches for the composite video signal decoding: 1) the use of the wavelet transform of the composite video signal for effective similarity computation, 2) an edge-based separation by using the composite video signal directly for sharp-edged results, 3) a simple motion-compensated similarity computation between frames. Also, the proposed algorithm has an adaptive architecture with which multiplication coefficients are adjusted by the similarity values between two pixels in lines of a field, two consecutive fields, and two consecutive frames. In case of comb failure, the proposed scheme resorts to the traditional band-pass filtering method. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides better performance than that of the conventional Y/C separation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.381738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","startPage":"623","endPage":"629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-Based 3D Y/C Separation Using Wavelet Transform and Motion Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4266951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Edge-Based 3D Y/C Separation Using Wavelet Transform and Motion Compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9687107","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4266951/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-Based 3D Y/C Separation Using Wavelet Transform and Motion Compensation","sourcePdf":"p623-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082309S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4266955,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Load signatures can be applied to produce many useful services and products, such as, determining the energy usage of individual appliances, monitoring the health of critical equipment, monitoring power quality, and developing facility management tools. Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616519","htmlLink":"/document/4266955/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method to Construct Taxonomy Electrical Appliances Based on Load Signaturesof","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method to Construct Taxonomy Electrical Appliances Based on Load Signaturesof","sourcePdf":"p653-lam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04858S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4266963,"authors":[{"name":"Yongtae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266963/4266963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongtae Kim received the B.E, M.S., and Ph.D degrees in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2007 respectively.

When implementing MVC, one of the most critical problems is heavy computational complexity caused by the large amount of information in multi-view sequences. Hence, a fast algorithm is essential. To reduce this computational complexity, we adoptively controlled a search range considering the reliability of each macroblock. In order to estimate this reliability, we calculated the difference between the predicted vectors that were obtained from different methods. When working with conventional encoders, vectors can be predicted using median filtering from causal blocks. Moreover, we calculated another predicted vector using multi-view camera geometry or the relationship between the disparity and motion vectors. We assumed that this difference indicated the reliability of the current macroblock. By using these properties, we were able to determine new search range and reduce the number of searching points within the limited window. The proposed MVC system was tested with several multi- view sequences to evaluate performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm was able to reduce processing time by maximumly 70-80% in estimation process.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.381750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266888","startPage":"712","endPage":"719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4266888/04266963.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Disparity and Motion Estimation for Multi-view Video Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4266963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4266963/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Disparity and Motion Estimation for Multi-view Video Coding","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9687108","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Disparity and Motion Estimation for Multi-view Video Coding","sourcePdf":"p712-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09924S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4266888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4266888","articleId":"4266963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4266969,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["Member"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4266888/4266969/4266969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nQing Wang (M'2005) was born in Xi'an, China.

The performance of HFB (original and two- stage) structures is analyzed for different values of oversampling ratios leading to the choice of the optimal value. The electronic elements of the analysis filter bank of HFB structure are considered with real constraints (realization errors and drifts). Real analysis filters of HFB are considered with the analog elements for which the real values are randomly Gaussian-distributed. Sensitivity to the deviations from real values is simulated and the performance of two HFB (original and two-stage) structures are compared. The possible methods for decreasing the sensitivity to realization errors such as Total Least Squares (TLS) optimization are discussed. Original structure is found to be a better candidate rather than the two-stage one in practical cases. However, it is shown that a blind estimation method would be necessary to compensate the realization errors for practically implementing the HFB-based A/D converters.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382011","startPage":"123","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267032/04267088.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influences of oversampling and analog imperfections on Hybrid Filter Bank A/D converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency conversion","RLC circuits","Circuit synthesis","Performance analysis","Least squares methods","Optimization methods","Equations","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","channel bank filters","channel estimation","Gaussian distribution","least squares approximations","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampling","analog imperfections","hybrid filter bank A-D converters","high-frequency A-D parallel converters","electronic elements","real analysis filters","Gaussian-distribution","total least squares optimization","blind estimation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Influences of oversampling and analog imperfections on Hybrid Filter Bank A/D converters","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4267088/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9867372","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influences of oversampling and analog imperfections on Hybrid Filter Bank A/D converters","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-1-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044379S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4267032","articleId":"4267088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4267109,"authors":[{"name":"Mitchell J.

It is demonstrated how a SystemC transaction level model of the platform can be used for automated architecture design exploration in three imaging application domains: medical, typical, and worst-case imaging. It is shown that with the virtual hardware platform it is possible to determine whether an architecture can sustain real-time processing requirements or not over 240 times faster than with RTL VHDL simulation. The virtual platform gives feedback of the design choices in memory and hardware resource usage and clock frequency requirements. These cannot be obtained from algorithmic C/C++ or Matlab model. In addition, by using a simple procedure to increase the parallelism of the system, our approach enables automated generation of customised architecture for varying processing requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267128/","displayDocTitle":"System Level Design Exploration of JPEG 2000 with SoftSONIC Virtual Hardware Platform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Level Design Exploration of JPEG 2000 with SoftSONIC Virtual Hardware Platform","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-1-96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054421S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","xplore-issue":"4267032","articleId":"4267128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4267129,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Agostini","affiliation":["GACI, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, BRAZIL"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Agostini","id":"37300469400"},{"name":"Marcelo Porto","affiliation":["GACI, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, BRAZIL"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Porto","id":"37409661800"},{"name":"Jose Luis Guntzel","affiliation":["GACI, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, BRAZIL"],"firstName":"Jose Luis","lastName":"Guntzel","id":"37354309200"},{"name":"Roger Porto","affiliation":["GME - Microelectronics Group, UFRGS - Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, BRAZIL"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Porto","id":"37689536100"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["GME - Microelectronics Group, UFRGS - Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, BRAZIL"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0172-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0173-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4267129","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Automatic voltage control","Quantization","Prototypes","Computer architecture","Software prototyping","Data mining","Decoding","HDTV"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design, the validation and the prototyping of a H.264/AVC inverse transform and quantization architecture.

Finally, the architecture was prototyped using a Digilent XUP V2P board that contains a Virtex-II Pro VP30 Xilinx FPGA. The architecture mapped to the target FPGA was stimulated in the prototyping board using a PowerPC processor that is hardwired in that FPGA. The prototype was validated and the results show that the designed architecture was working in accordance with the H.264/AVC standard.

Hardware Description Languages are used for high-level digital system design. VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) provides the capability of different coding styles for FSMs. Therefore, a choice of a coding style is needed to achieve specific performance goals and to minimize resource utilization for implementation in a re-configurable computing environment such as an FPGA. This paper is a study of the tradeoffs that can be made by changing coding styles. A comparative study on three different FSM coding styles is shown to address their impact on performance and resource utilization for the most commonly used encoding methods for FPGA designs. The results show that a particular coding style leads to a savings in resource utilization with a significant performance improvement over the others while the others pose a consistent performance regardless of the resource utilization outcome.","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267032/04267143.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Finite State Machine Coding Styles for Implementation in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Finite State Machine Coding Styles for Implementation in FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4267143/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Finite State Machine Coding Styles for Implementation in FPGAs","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-1-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033483S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4267032","articleId":"4267143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267145,"authors":[{"name":"Sunitha Kopparthi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Sunitha","lastName":"Kopparthi","id":"37277549800"},{"name":"Don M.

This algorithm is one of the set of iterative methods used in the hyperspectral imaging area to estimate abundance. However, ISRA is highly computational, making it difficult to obtain results in a timely manner. In this paper we present the use of specialized hardware in the implementation of this algorithm, specifically the use of VHDL and FPGAs. The implementation of ISRA algorithm has been divided into hardware and software units. The hardware units were implemented on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro XC2VP30 FPGA and the software was implemented on the Xilinx Microblaze soft processor. This illustrates that this approach is a design alternative for iterative hyperspectral imaging algorithms. The main bottleneck found in this implementations was data transfer.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382091","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267032/04267168.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm using FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm using FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267168/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm using FPGAs","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-1-136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056171S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4267032","articleId":"4267168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267173,"authors":[{"name":"Ronak Trivedi","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Ronak","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37088274109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0172-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0173-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4267173","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1375},"abstract":"This paper describes the improved sample- and-hold architecture as a front-end block of low power and high speed pipelined analog to digital converter.

Unlike regular reconfigurable FPGAs, where a new bit-stream is downloaded from a limited bandwidth external memory, multi-context devices can be partially or fully reconfigured from their internal configuration memories by means of a fast context swapping. Their very fast reconfiguration time permits mapping virtual circuits efficiently, that is, a time-multiplexed execution of circuit partitions that behaves as the circuit statically implemented on a larger capacity FPGA. The main drawback of multi-context FPGAs is the lack of commercial devices and design tools to take profit from them.

These techniques are unified by a common structural design approach, based on the following principles: system analysis at the high level of abstraction using the graphic tools like signal flow graphs, and generation of the set of equivalent graph modifications, equivalent graph transformations to the form when every important parameter in the system or the amplifier is controlled by a dedicated feedback loop; stability of these loops is achieved without compensation capacitors, by using one-stage (preferably current) amplifiers, system synthesis consists of implementation of the set of the gain structure modifications followed by simulations based on available library of cells, and final selection of the best circuit solutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Analog circuits","Design methodology","CMOS technology","Silicon","System performance","Low voltage","Rail to rail inputs","Switching circuits","Cost function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382185","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267263.pdf","startPage":"xxxv","endPage":"xxxvi","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Techniques for Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement: Analog Circuit Design with Structural Methodology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Techniques for Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement: Analog Circuit Design with Structural Methodology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267263/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Techniques for Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement: Analog Circuit Design with Structural Methodology","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030927S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4267263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4267283,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Soler-Garrido","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Soler-Garrido","id":"38275567600"},{"name":"Robert J.

BP has been shown to obtain excellent results when solving inference problems in sparsely connected factor graphs. Unfortunately, MIMO detection is an example of inference in a densely connected graph, so other techniques need to be applied. We show that BP in conjunction with simulated annealing can offer near optimal performance when there is enough diversity in the receiver. Interestingly, this algorithm can be easily mapped into analog circuitry, thus leading to potentially low-power area-efficient MIMO detectors. A small analog detector based on this work has been designed and laid out in a 0.25\u03bcm BiCMOS process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267283.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog MIMO detection on the basis of Belief Propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Belief propagation","Signal processing algorithms","Decoding","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Inference algorithms","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","decoding","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radiocommunication","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog MIMO detection","belief propagation algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","BP algorithm","sparsely connected factor graphs","densely connected graph","analog circuitry","MIMO detectors","analog detector design","BiCMOS process","size 0.25 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analog MIMO detection on the basis of Belief Propagation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4267283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10355498","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog MIMO detection on the basis of Belief Propagation","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048587S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267308,"authors":[{"name":"Tang Yong","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest jiaotong universty, Chengdu, china"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Yong","id":"37267655900"},{"name":"Feng Quan Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest jiaotong universty, Chengdu, china"],"firstName":"Feng Quan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085959315"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0172-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0173-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4267308","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low voltage","Circuits","Power MOSFET","Voltage control","FETs","High power amplifiers","Microelectronics","DC-DC power converters","Resistors","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","DC-DC power convertors","low-power electronics","power amplifiers","power MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless low voltage current sense amplifier circuit","power MOSFET current","boost DC-DC converter","USMT BCD process","voltage 2 V","size 0.6 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267308","abstract":"In this paper, a novel low voltage lossless current-sensing amplifier circuit which senses the current of power MOSFET in control scheme for boost DC-DC converter is presented.

We have proposed a mixed approach where the spectrum of each finite short time section of the signal is estimated by realizing a DFT through a bank of IIR Goertzel Filters centered at the specified frequencies. This approach allows computing the time varying spectrum at precisely the frequencies of interest. The Goertzel algorithm can be adjusted to implement the Nonuniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NDFT). Within the NDFT framework the estimation of the spectrum at the desired frequency it is not conditioned to the requirement that the DFT index, k, be an integer. We have termed this implementation of the discrete STFT the \"Nonuniform Discrete Short Time Fourier Transform\" (NSTFT). A MATLAB program was written and validated using this technique, then the methods were compared for different windows size and different number of frequencies of interest, to a MATLAB FIR filtering view implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267319.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform A Goertzel Filter Bank versus a FIR Filtering Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Fourier transforms","Filtering","Discrete Fourier transforms","IIR filters","Frequency estimation","MATLAB","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","discrete Fourier transforms","discrete time filters","FIR filters","IIR filters","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete short-time Fourier transform","Goertzel filter bank","FIR filtering approach","IIR filter","time varying spectrum","Goertzel algorithm","nonuniform Fourier transform","MATLAB program"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform A Goertzel Filter Bank versus a FIR Filtering Approach","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4267319/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10355524","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform A Goertzel Filter Bank versus a FIR Filtering Approach","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070229S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267321,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz K.

In this paper, a new hardware architecture using conjugate distributed arithmetic (CDA) which is suitable for high throughput hardware implementations of LMS adaptive filters is presented. Unlike a traditional distributed arithmetic (DA) implementation where all possible combination sums of the filter coefficients are stored in a look-up-table (LUT), in the CDA architecture, all possible combination sums of the input signal samples are stored in the LUT and updated at the arrival of every sample using an efficient update procedure. We describe the design of CDA adaptive filters and show that practical implementations of CDA adaptive filters have very high throughput relative to multiply and accumulate architectures. We also show that CDA adaptive filters have a potential area and power consumption advantage over DSP microprocessor architectures for a given throughput.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382270","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","startPage":"295","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conjugate Distributed Arithmetic Adaptive FIR Filters and their Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conjugate Distributed Arithmetic Adaptive FIR Filters and their Hardware Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10355543","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate Distributed Arithmetic Adaptive FIR Filters and their Hardware Implementation","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089849S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267382,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuk Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hyuk","lastName":"Park","id":"37290676200"},{"name":"Earl E.

In a practical OFDM system, Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) destroys the orthogonality among the subcarriers, and hence introduces Intercarrier Interference (ICI). This contribution proposes a novel Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator (BCFOE). The BCFOE is based on kurtosis, and can identify CFO within the range of half subcarrier spacing of OFDM systems. Compared with the existing low-complexity blind CFO estimation technique [9, 10, 11], the BCFOE, for the same computational complexity, has the better performance. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed BCFOE.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382313","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267391.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267391/","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9867340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267391/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063291S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267392,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Hoon Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hoon","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37289925000"},{"name":"Yong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0172-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0173-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"4267392","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Delay effects","Interference","Performance gain","Mean square error methods","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information","adaptive modulation and coding","packet scheduling","spectral efficiency","multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","performance degradation","link adaptation","predicted channel gain","minimum mean square error prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel state information","packet scheduling","MMSE prediction","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Channel information is indispensable to employ advanced channel aware technologies such as packet scheduling and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). In this paper, we first investigate the delay effect of instantaneous signal to interference and noise power ratio (SINR) on the spectral efficiency of multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems that employ packet-based channel aware technologies. To alleviate the performance degradation due to delayed channel information, we consider the use of predicted channel gain for link adaptation with packet scheduling. It is shown that the use of predicted channel gain can significantly enhance the spectral efficiency particularly in high mobility environments. For practical realization of an optimum predictor, we propose a grouped minimum mean square error (MMSE) prediction scheme, which can substantially reduce the implementation complexity without noticeable performance degradation. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382314","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267392.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.382314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of channel information in multi-user OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267392/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of channel information in multi-user OFDM systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9867356","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267392/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of channel information in multi-user OFDM systems","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060186S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4267399,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Mobilon","affiliation":["Optical Communication Systems, CPqD Telecom & IT Solutions, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Mobilon","id":"37541118700"},{"name":"Marcos R.

The price paid for the increased efficiency is the distortion of the transmission signal. To fulfill a given spectral mask for the transmission signal and to avoid an unacceptable high bit-error rate on the receiver side, the amplifier must be linearized. If wideband signals as WCDMA or OFDM are used, static nonlinear predistorters are in general not sufficient to obtain the required performance. For this reason, we consider the most general nonlinear system, described by a complex baseband Volterra series, as a starting point for our investigations. Although Volterra series provides the best performance, a serious drawback is the huge number of free parameters and the high implementational complexity. Therefore we reduce the complex baseband Volterra system (43 parameter) to a complex baseband system with a lower complexity (11 parameter) and apply the developed predistorters to a physical 2.2-GHz 90-W Class AB RF power amplifier. Although we have reduced the number of parameters dramatically, the spectral performance is comparable to the full Volterra predistorter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Radio frequency","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Nonlinear distortion","Bit error rate","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","distortion","error statistics","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiocommunication","UHF power amplifiers","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear wideband RF power amplifiers","complex baseband predistorters","wireless communication systems","nonlinear region","transmission signal distortion","WCDMA","OFDM","bit-error rate","receiver","static nonlinear predistorters","complex baseband Volterra series","frequency 2.2 GHz","power 90 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.381821","publicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 49th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267031/4267246/04267445.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2006.381821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Baseband Predistorters for Nonlinear Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Complex Baseband Predistorters for Nonlinear Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267445/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267445/","accessionNumber":"9867422","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Baseband Predistorters for Nonlinear Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"MWSCAS06-2-199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048752S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4267031","isNumber":"4267246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267031","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4267246","articleId":"4267445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4267479,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This parameter consists of a phase, which is a function of all channel gains, and has a simple closed-form expression.

Cheap, smart devices with multiple onboard sensors, networked through wireless links and the Internet and deployed in large numbers, provide unprecedented opportunities for instrumenting and controlling homes, cities, and the environment. One of the crucial issues in wireless sensor networks is position determination. In this work a positioning system based on received signal strength (RSS) and WLAN is presented. In indoor environments, received signal strength is a complex function of distance. In this work artificial neural network is used to establish a relationship between RSS and location. The location determination accuracy of the proposed system has been investigated and promising results have been achieved.

However, the data always enclose uncertainties due to only limited intrusive information available and ambiguous information about computer users' activities. While designing intrusion detection systems, these uncertainties should be taken into consideration. Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process. For verifying the detection accuracy of our classifier, User to Root and Remote to Local attacks of DARPA KDD99 Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set were used. We compared the results of our proposed approach with those of k-NN classifier, fuzzy k-NN classifier and evidence-theoretic k-NN classifier. It indicates that our approach has achieved higher detection rates than those of from the other three classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/IAW.2007.381934","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE SMC Information Assurance and Security Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE SMC Information Assurance and Security Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267526/4267527/04267562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAW.2007.381934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267527","startPage":"207","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Belief k-Nearest Neighbors Anomaly Detection of User to Root and Remote to Local Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Belief k-Nearest Neighbors Anomaly Detection of User to Root and Remote to Local Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9723871","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Belief k-Nearest Neighbors Anomaly Detection of User to Root and Remote to Local Attacks","confLoc":"West Point, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IAW-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106583S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267526","isNumber":"4267527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267526","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4267527","articleId":"4267562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267564,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37292395900"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37288442100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1303-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1304-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4267564","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"Network anomaly detection plays a vital role in securing network security and infrastructures. Current research focuses concentrate on how to effective reduce high false alarm rate and usually ignore the fact that the poor quality data for the modeling of normal patterns as well as the high computational cost make the current anomaly detection methods not act as well as we expect. Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the data reduction mechanisms would greatly improve the performance of TCM-KNN and make it be a good candidate for anomaly detection in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE SMC Information Assurance and Security Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267526/4267527/04267564.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE SMC Information Assurance and Security Workshop","doi":"10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Network Anomaly Detection Scheme Based on TCM-KNN Algorithm and Data Reduction Mechanism","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Data mining","Testing","Data security","Genetic algorithms","Computational efficiency","Conferences","Detection algorithms","Costs","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data reduction","genetic algorithms","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection scheme","data reduction mechanism","computational cost","data mining scheme","genetic algorithm","instance selection","filter based feature selection methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Security","Anomaly Detection","TCM-KNN Algorithm","Data Reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Network Anomaly Detection Scheme Based on TCM-KNN Algorithm and Data Reduction Mechanism","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9723873","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Network Anomaly Detection Scheme Based on TCM-KNN Algorithm and Data Reduction Mechanism","confLoc":"West Point, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IAW-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047522S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267526","isNumber":"4267527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267526","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4267527","articleId":"4267564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267649,"authors":[{"name":"Knut Akesson","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Akesson","id":"37328575900"},{"name":"Martin Fabian","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Fabian","id":"37282468500"},{"name":"Hugo Flordal","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Flordal","id":"37689562600"},{"name":"Robi Malik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Robi","lastName":"Malik","id":"37408403700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0053-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4267649","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete event simulation","Discrete event systems","Automata","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Data structures","IEC standards","Costs","Signal synthesis","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","control system CAD","data structures","discrete event systems","finite automata","IEC standards","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Supremica","discrete event system verification","discrete event system synthesis","discrete event system simulation","finite automata","state spaces","data structure","binary decision diagram","code generation","IEC 61131 standard","IEC 61499 standard"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267649","abstract":"An integrated environment, Supremica, for verification, synthesis and simulation of discrete event systems is presented.

The advantage of this grading system is a good correlation with the biological behavior of the tumor, while its drawback is the subjectivity underlying the judgements of pathologists. Therefore, an automation of Gleason grading would be desirable. In this paper, we examined 780 digitized grayscale images of 78 different cases, which were split into a training and a test set. We developed two methods based on combinations of morphological characteristics like area fraction, line length, and Euler number to classify into the categories \"Gleason score <7\" and \"Gleason score ges7.\" In particular, the distinction between these two classes has great impact on the prognosis of patients. The agreement of each method with visual diagnosis was 87.18% and 92.31% within the training set and 66.67% and 64.10% within the test set, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/4267676/04267694.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2006.888703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2006.888703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Classification of Prostate Carcinoma With Methods from Spatial Statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Prostate cancer","Neoplasms","Glands","Image analysis","Testing","Automation","Gray-scale","Industrial training","Malignant tumors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","cancer","image classification","medical computing","medical image processing","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual diagnosis","patient prognosis","Gleason score","Euler number","line length","area fraction","tumor","histology","prostate cancer","pathology","Gleason grading","spatial statistics","prostate carcinoma"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic classification","Gleason grading","interrater reliability","morphological characteristics","prostatic adenocarcinoma","spatial statistics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adenocarcinoma","Adenocarcinoma","Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Male","Neoplasm Staging","Prostatic Neoplasms","Prostatic Neoplasms","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Severity of Illness Index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Classification of Prostate Carcinoma With Methods from Spatial Statistics","volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267694/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616359","pubMedId":"17674623","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Classification of Prostate Carcinoma With Methods from Spatial Statistics","sourcePdf":"11titb04-wittke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056517S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4267676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4267676","articleId":"4267694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4267698,"authors":[{"name":"Alma Y.

Robust control theory offers a framework for analyzing the stability of feedback control loops, but for the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework used here, all components are required to be represented as linear, time-invariant systems plus uncertainties with, for IQCs used here, bounded gain. In this paper, the stability of a control loop including a recurrent neural network (NN) is analyzed by replacing the nonlinear and time-varying components of the NN with IQCs on their gain. As a result, a range of the NN's weights is found within which stability is guaranteed. An algorithm is demonstrated for training the recurrent NN using reinforcement learning and guaranteeing stability while learning.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.899520","startPage":"993","endPage":"1002","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4267697/04267699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.899520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Reinforcement Learning Control Using Integral Quadratic Constraints for Recurrent Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Feedback control","Stability analysis","Machine learning","Robust stability","Integral equations","Constraint theory","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","linear systems","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets","robust control","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","reinforcement learning control","integral quadratic constraints","recurrent neural networks","machine learning","feedback control system","stability guarantee","linear time-invariant systems","uncertain system","nonlinear component","time-varying component","adaptive control","convex optimization","proportional integral control","PI control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integral quadratic constraints (IQCs)","recurrent neural networks (NNs)","reinforcement learning","robust control"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biomimetics","Computer Simulation","Decision Support Techniques","Feedback","Least-Squares Analysis","Markov Chains","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Reinforcement (Psychology)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Reinforcement Learning Control Using Integral Quadratic Constraints for Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267699/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616373","pubMedId":"17668656","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Reinforcement Learning Control Using Integral Quadratic Constraints for Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-anderson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085986S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4267701,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Colin","affiliation":["LME EA 1206, Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et dEnerg\u00e9tique, Orleans, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267701/4267701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guillaume Colin was born in Metz, France, in 1980.

In this context, an efficient control of the air actuators [throttle, turbo wastegate, and variable camshaft timing (VCT)] is needed for engine torque control. This paper proposes a nonlinear model-based control scheme which combines separate, but coordinated, control modules. Theses modules are based on different control strategies: internal model control (IMC), model predictive control (MPC), and optimal control. It is shown how neural models can be used at different levels and included in the control modules to replace physical models, which are too complex to be online embedded, or to estimate nonmeasured variables. The results obtained from two different test benches show the real-time applicability and good control performance of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9607659","pubMedId":"17668664","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267701/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Control of Fast Nonlinear Systems\u2014 Application to a Turbocharged SI Engine With VCT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Control of Fast Nonlinear Systems\u2014 Application to a Turbocharged SI Engine With VCT","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-colin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093079S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4267705,"authors":[{"name":"Alok Kanti Deb","affiliation":["Center for Soft Computing Research A National Facility, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267705/4267705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alok Kanti Deb (S'02) was born in Ranaghat, West Bengal, India.

A least squares support vector machine (SVM) regressor has been used for generating the control actions, while an SVM-based tree-type neural network (NN) is used as the critic. After a failure occurs, the critic and action are retrained in tandem using the failure data. Failure data is binary classification data, where the number of failure states are very few as compared to the number of no-failure states. The difficulty of conventional multilayer feedforward NNs in learning this type of classification data has been overcome by using the SVM-based tree-type NN, which due to its feature to add neurons to learn misclassified data, has the capability to learn any binary classification data without a priori choice of the number of neurons or the structure of the network.

Specifically, monitoring and controlling the depth of anesthesia in surgery is of particular importance. Nonnegative and compartmental models provide a broad framework for biological and physiological systems, including clinical pharmacology, and are well suited for developing models for closed-loop control of drug administration. In this paper, we develop a neural adaptive output feedback control framework for nonlinear uncertain nonnegative and compartmental systems with nonnegative control inputs. The proposed framework is Lyapunov-based and guarantees ultimate boundedness of the error signals. In addition, the neural adaptive controller guarantees that the physical system states remain in the nonnegative orthant of the state space. Finally, the proposed approach is used to control the infusion of the anesthetic drug propofol for maintaining a desired constant level of depth of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9606757","pubMedId":"17668661","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267708/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Adaptive Output Feedback Control for Intensive Care Unit Sedation and Intraoperative Anesthesia","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Adaptive Output Feedback Control for Intensive Care Unit Sedation and Intraoperative Anesthesia","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-haddad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190853S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4267709,"authors":[{"name":"William Holderbaum","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267709/4267709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["William Holderbaum (M'02) received the M.Sc. degree in automatic control from the University of Reims, France, in 1994 and the Ph.D. degree in contact theory from the University of Lille, France, in 1999.","Currently, he is a Lecturer at the School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, U.K. His research interests are in control theory and its applications.

The approach of this paper can be viewed as a discrete counterpart of our previous paper on approximately solving the continuous-time nonlinear output regulation problem.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.899212","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4267697/04267712.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1208","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.899212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Approximate Output Regulation of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Approximate Output Regulation of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9609817","pubMedId":"17668671","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267712/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network-Based Approximate Output Regulation of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-lan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095937S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267719,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin Sitte","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering and Data Communication, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267719/4267719-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joaquin Sitte received the Licenciado degree in physics from the Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela, in 1968 and the Ph.D. degree in quantum chemistry from Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, in 1974.","Until 1985, he was an Associate Professor at the Universidad de Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela, where he also headed the Surface Physics Research Group.

The second method involves the assumption of stochastic dynamics which introduces a regularizing second derivative term to the HJB equation. A gradual reduction of this term provides further stabilization of the convergence. We demonstrate the solution of several problems, including the 4D inverted-pendulum system with bounded control. Our approach requires no initial stabilizing policy or any restrictive assumptions on the plant or cost function, only knowledge of the plant dynamics.

However, under high EGR levels, the engine exhibits strong cyclic dispersion in heat release which may lead to instability and unsatisfactory performance preventing commercial engines to operate with high EGR levels. A neural network (NN)-based output feedback controller is developed to reduce cyclic variation in the heat release under high levels of EGR even when the engine dynamics are unknown by using fuel as the control input. A separate control loop was designed for controlling EGR levels. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is given and the boundedness of the control input is demonstrated by relaxing separation principle, persistency of excitation condition, certainty equivalence principle, and linear in the unknown parameter assumptions. Online training is used for the adaptive NN and no offline training phase is needed. This online learning feature and model-free approach is used to demonstrate the applicability of the controller on a different engine with minimal effort. Simulation results demonstrate that the cyclic dispersion is reduced significantly using the proposed controller when implemented on an engine model that has been validated experimentally. For a single cylinder research engine fitted with a modern four-valve head (Ricardo engine), experimental results at 15% EGR indicate that cyclic dispersion was reduced 33% by the controller, an improvement of fuel efficiency by 2%, and a 90% drop in NO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n from stoichiometric operation without EGR was observed. Moreover, unburned hydrocarbons (uHC) drop by 6% due to NN control as compared to the uncontrolled scenario due to the drop in cyclic dispersion. Similar performance was observed with the controller on a different engine.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.899199","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4267697/04267721.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.899199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Controller Development and Implementation for Spark Ignition Engines With High EGR Levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Controller Development and Implementation for Spark Ignition Engines With High EGR Levels","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605944","pubMedId":"17668663","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267721/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Controller Development and Implementation for Spark Ignition Engines With High EGR Levels","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-vance.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083253S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4267723,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267723/4267723-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Xu was born in Hubei, P.

By using KLSPI, near-optimal control policies can be obtained without much a priori knowledge on dynamic models of control plants. In KLSPI, Mercer kernels are used in the policy evaluation of a policy iteration process, where a new kernel-based least squares temporal-difference algorithm called KLSTD-Q is proposed for efficient policy evaluation. To keep the sparsity and improve the generalization ability of KLSTD-Q solutions, a kernel sparsification procedure based on approximate linear dependency (ALD) is performed. Compared to the previous works on approximate RL methods, KLSPI makes two progresses to eliminate the main difficulties of existing results. One is the better convergence and (near) optimality guarantee by using the KLSTD-Q algorithm for policy evaluation with high precision. The other is the automatic feature selection using the ALD-based kernel sparsification. Therefore, the KLSPI algorithm provides a general RL method with generalization performance and convergence guarantee for large-scale Markov decision problems (MDPs). Experimental results on a typical RL task for a stochastic chain problem demonstrate that KLSPI can consistently achieve better learning efficiency and policy quality than the previous least squares policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. Furthermore, the KLSPI method was also evaluated on two nonlinear feedback control problems, including a ship heading control problem and the swing up control of a double-link underactuated pendulum called acrobot. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can optimize controller performance using little a priori information of uncertain dynamic systems. It is also demonstrated that KLSPI can be applied to online learning control by incorporating an initial controller to ensure online performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.899161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4267697/04267723.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.899161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267697","startPage":"973","endPage":"992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel-Based Least Squares Policy Iteration for Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-Based Least Squares Policy Iteration for Reinforcement Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9619858","pubMedId":"17668655","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267723/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel-Based Least Squares Policy Iteration for Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101609S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4267697","articleId":"4267723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4267724,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Yadav","affiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37689910200"},{"name":"Radhakant Padhi","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Radhakant","lastName":"Padhi","id":"37296283400"},{"name":"S.

A 1-D distributed parameter model of a fin is developed from basic thermal physics principles. ldquoSnapshotrdquo solutions of the dynamics are generated with a simple dynamic inversion-based feedback controller. Empirical basis functions are designed using the ldquoproper orthogonal decompositionrdquo (POD) technique and the snapshot solutions. A low-order nonlinear lumped parameter system to characterize the infinite dimensional system is obtained by carrying out a Galerkin projection. An ADP-based neurocontroller with a dual heuristic programming (DHP) formulation is obtained with a single-network-adaptive-critic (SNAC) controller for this approximate nonlinear model. Actual control in the original domain is calculated with the same POD basis functions through a reverse mapping. Further contribution of this paper includes development of an online robust neurocontroller to account for unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties inherent in such a complex dynamic system. A neural network (NN) weight update rule that guarantees boundedness of the weights and relaxes the need for persistence of excitation (PE) condition is presented. Simulation studies show that in a fairly extensive but compact domain, any desired temperature profile can be achieved starting from any initial temperature profile. Therefore, the ADP and NN-based controllers appear to have the potential to become controller synthesis tools for nonlinear distributed parameter systems.","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4267697/04267724.pdf","startPage":"1115","endPage":"1128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.899229","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.899229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267724","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Optimal control","Temperature control","Aerospace control","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Vehicle dynamics","Aerodynamics","Neurocontrollers","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","distributed parameter systems","feedback","Galerkin method","heuristic programming","neurocontrollers","optimal control","robust control","space vehicles","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust temperature profile control","optimal temperature profile control","highspeed aerospace vehicle","neural networks","approximate dynamic programming","suboptimal neurocontroller","1D distributed parameter model","thermal physics","dynamic inversion-based feedback controller","proper orthogonal decomposition","snapshot solutions","Galerkin projection","dual heuristic programming","single-network-adaptive-critic controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control of distributed parameter systems","neural networks (NNs)","proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)","temperature control"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Energy Transfer","Feedback","Heat","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Spacecraft","Temperature","Thermography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust/Optimal Temperature Profile Control of a High-Speed Aerospace Vehicle Using Neural Networks","accessionNumber":"9609818","pubMedId":"17668665","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust/Optimal Temperature Profile Control of a High-Speed Aerospace Vehicle Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"18tnn04-yadav.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054293S","chronDate":"July  2007","isNumber":"4267697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4267724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4267725,"authors":[{"name":"Bong-Jun Yang","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4267697/4267725/4267725-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bong-Jun Yang (S'02\u2013M'03) received the B.S. degree in aeronautical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993, the M.S. degree in astronautics and aeronautics from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1998, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2004.","Currently, he is a Research Engineer II at the School of Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

Only two sensed voltages, a passive filter network and a hysteretic comparator are required to implement the main control functions: the output voltage regulation and the adaptive voltage positioning. This paper also shows that other previously reported low-cost control solutions have an important design tradeoff between load transient response and efficiency. In the proposed controller, the closed-loop output impedance can be designed to be resistive and the switching frequency can be adjusted to be independent of the output impedance requirement so that the load transient response and the efficiency can be optimized separately. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed controller (i.e., a load transient response with insignificant output voltage overshoot and selectable switching frequency independent of the output impedance requirement). </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267740/","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605933","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Simple Low-Cost Hysteretic Controller for Single-Phase Synchronous Buck Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Low-Cost Hysteretic Controller for Single-Phase Synchronous Buck Converters","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-castilla.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08303S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4267747,"authors":[{"name":"Karel De Brabandere","affiliation":["Department ESAT/ELECTA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267747/4267747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karel De Brabandere (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree in electrotechnical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2000, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree on the subject of the control of grid-connected power electronic inverters for the integration of distributed energy resources in island grids and the utility grid.","His research interests include power electronics, digital control, distributed power systems and microgrids."]},"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"De Brabandere","id":"37274717000"},{"name":"Bruno Bolsens","affiliation":["Department ESAT/ELECTA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267747/4267747-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno Bolsens (S'03) received the M.Sc. degree in electrotechnical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2000, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree on the subject of power electronic circuits with limited electromagnetic interference properties in electric distribution networks.","His research interests include power electronics, digital control, inverter topologies, power quality and EMC issues."]},"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bolsens","id":"37274715100"},{"name":"Jeroen Van den Keybus","affiliation":["Department ESAT/ELECTA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267747/4267747-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Jeroen Van den Keybus (S'05) was born in Belgium in 1975.

Frequency and voltage control, including mitigation of voltage harmonics, are achieved without the need for any common control circuitry or communication between inverters. Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference ac voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual complex impedance. The reference ac voltage source is synchronized with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between rated and actual grid frequency. A detailed analysis shows that this approach has a superior behavior compared to existing methods, regarding the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behavior and the effectiveness of the frequency and voltage control, as it takes the R to X line impedance ratio into account. Experiments show the behavior of the method for an inverter feeding a highly nonlinear load and during the connection of two parallel inverters in operation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267747.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Voltage and Frequency Droop Control Method for Parallel Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Voltage and Frequency Droop Control Method for Parallel Inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267747/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9607650","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267747/","volume":"22","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Voltage and Frequency Droop Control Method for Parallel Inverters","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-debrabandere.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099638S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"1039","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":4267748,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Feng","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267748/4267748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guang Feng (M'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2005.","Since August 2005, he has been a Power Electronics Engineer with the Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL.

Using the concept of capacitor charge balance, the proposed algorithm predicts the optimal transient response for a dc-to-dc converter during a large signal load current change. During steady state operation, conventional current mode proportional-integral-derivative (PID) is used. During large signal transient conditions, the new control algorithm takes over. The equations needed to calculate the transient time and the required duty cycle series are presented. By using the proposed algorithm, the optimal transient performances, including the smallest output voltage overshoot/undershoot and the shortest recovery time, is achieved. In addition, since the large signal dynamic response of the power converter is successfully predicted, the large signal stability is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior dynamic performance over a conventional current mode PID controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Digital Control Algorithm to Achieve Optimal Dynamic Performance in DC-to-DC Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267748.pdf","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Digital Control Algorithm to Achieve Optimal Dynamic Performance in DC-to-DC Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267748/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Digital Control Algorithm to Achieve Optimal Dynamic Performance in DC-to-DC Converters","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-feng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071365S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267749,"authors":[{"name":"Saulo Finco","affiliation":["CenPRA, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267749/4267749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saulo Finco (M'91) was born in Curitiba, Brazil, in 1965.

Through design, simulation, and experimental characterization, the students were able to experience the different steps of a Smart Power project, from the power device basic switching cell mask layout to the final system prototype, in 60 hours of a one semester course. The referred Smart Power Integrated Circuit (IC) embedding analog and digital basic blocks and high-voltage transistor arrays is the key idea to the presented pedagogical methodology. Based on this Smart Power IC, different topologies required by power electronics and power management systems were implemented.

SiC JFETs and SBDs were packaged in high temperature packages to measure the dc characteristics of these SiC devices at ambient temperatures ranging from 25degC (room temperature) up to 450degC. The results show that both devices can operate at 450degC, which is impossible for conventional Si devices, at the expense of significant derating. The current capability of the SiC SBD does not change with temperature, but as expected the JFET current decreases with rising temperatures. A 100 V, 25 W dc-dc converter is used as an example of a high-temperature power-electronics circuit because of circuit simplicity. The converter is designed and built in accordance with the static characteristics of the SiC devices measured under extremely high ambient temperatures, and then tested up to an ambient temperature of 400degC. The conduction loss of the SiC JFET increases slightly with increasing temperatures, as predicted from its dc characteristics, but its switching characteristics hardly change. Thus, SiC devices are well suited for operation in harsh temperature environments like aerospace and automotive applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267750.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Conversion With SiC Devices at Extremely High Ambient Temperatures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267750/","displayDocTitle":"Power Conversion With SiC Devices at Extremely High Ambient Temperatures","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267750/","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606750","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Conversion With SiC Devices at Extremely High Ambient Temperatures","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-funaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06167S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267754,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghui Huang","affiliation":["GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267754/4267754-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianghui Huang (S'01\u2013M'05) received the dual B.S. degree in both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2005.","From 2004 to 2005, he was a Graduate Research Associate at the Power Electronics and Electrical Machinery Research Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Unlike a line-fed electric motor, the eccentricity-related fault signals exist in the current as well as the voltage of a drive-connected motor. Meanwhile, since the speed and therefore the mechanical load can change widely in variable speed applications, the amplitudes of the fault signals will vary accordingly. An artificial neural network is used in the detection to learn the complex relationship between the eccentricity-related harmonic amplitudes and the operating conditions. The neural network can estimate a threshold corresponding to an operating condition, which can then be used to predict the motor condition. The neural network is trained and tested with data collected on drive-connected 4-pole, 7.5 Hp, three-phase induction motors.

The voltage gain is extended easily and the voltage stress on the switches is reduced with different turns ratios of the coupled inductors.

The simple but effective passive lossless clamp circuits are introduced to limit the voltage stress on the switches when they turn off so that the low-voltage, high-performance devices with low conduction resistor can be used in the proposed converter to reduce the relative losses. The leakage energy is ultimately recovered to the load. The high efficiency of 90.7% at full load and the maximum efficiency of 92.6% are achieved in a 1-kW 40-V-input-to-380-V-output prototype for front-end application.

First, the dynamic model of an indirect field-oriented LIM drive is derived. Next, a backstepping sliding-mode approach is designed to compensate the uncertainties occurring in the motion control system. Moreover, the uncertainties are lumped and the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty is necessary in the design of the backstepping sliding-mode controller. However, the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty is difficult to obtain in advance of practical applications. Therefore, an adaptive law is derived to adapt the value of the lumped uncertainty in real time, and an adaptive backstepping sliding-mode control law is the result. Then, an FPGA chip is adopted to implement the indirect field-oriented mechanism and the developed control algorithms for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by some experimental results.

The equivalent circuit model and ripple current reduction with passive energy storage component are simulated and verified with experiments. An advanced active control technique is then proposed to incorporate a current control loop in the dc-dc converter for ripple reduction.

This converter is also sometimes referred to as a ldquohybrid converterrdquo since it splits high-voltage/low-frequency and low-voltage/pulsewidth-modulation (PWM)-frequency power production between ldquobulkrdquo and ldquoconditioningrdquo converters respectively. Cascaded multilevel converters achieve higher power quality with a given switch count when compared to traditional multilevel converters. This is a particularly favorable option for high power and high performance applications such as naval ship propulsion. This paper first presents a new control method for the topology using three-level bulk and conditioning inverters connected in series through a three-phase load. This control avoids PWM frequency switching in the bulk inverter. The conditioning inverter uses a capacitor source and its control is based on compensating the real and reactive (P-Q) power difference between the bulk inverter and the load. The new control explicitly commands power into the conditioning inverter so that its capacitor voltage remains constant. A unique space vector analysis of hybrid converter modulation is introduced to quantitatively determine operating limitations. The conclusion is then generalized for all types of controls of the hybrid multilevel converters (involving three-level converter cells). The proposed control methods and analytical conclusions are verified by simulation and laboratory measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267768.pdf","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Control and Analysis of Cascaded Multilevel Converters Based on P-Q Compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Switching converters","Switches","Capacitors","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","Production","Power quality","Marine vehicles","Propulsion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drives","DC-AC power convertors","invertors","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector analysis","capacitor voltage","conditioning inverter","bulk inverter","PWM frequency switching","hybrid converter","cascaded multilevel power converter","P-Q compensation","advanced control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","DC\u2013AC power conversion","pulsewidth-modulated inverters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Control and Analysis of Cascaded Multilevel Converters Based on P-Q Compensation","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267768/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606753","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Control and Analysis of Cascaded Multilevel Converters Based on P-Q Compensation","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-lu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070836S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267769,"authors":[{"name":"Sudip K.

The PCS consists of a zero-ripple boost converter (ZRBC) followed by a soft-switched and multilevel high-frequency (HF) inverter and a single-phase cycloconverter. The ZRBC comprises a new zero-ripple filter (ZRF), which significantly reduces the input low- and high-frequency current ripples, thereby potentially enhancing the durability of the stack. A new phase-shifted sinewave modulation of the multilevel HF inverter is proposed, which results in the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of all four switches without the use of any auxiliary circuit components. For such a sine wave modulation technique, >90% ZVS range is obtained per line cycle for about 70% of the rated load. Further, the line-frequency switching of the cycloconverter (at close to unity power factor) results in extremely low switching losses. The intermediate dc bus facilitates the inclusion of power systems based on other forms of alternative-energy techniques (e.g., photovoltaic/high-voltage stack). A 5 kW prototype of the proposed PCS is built, which currently achieves a peak efficiency of 92.4%. We present a detailed description of the operation of the PCS along with its key features and advantages.

Additionally there is often a need for silent operation, which implies switching frequencies above 20 kHz. Increasingly, high-frequency DC-DC converters are being used for these applications, with their advantages of reduced size and weight. However, the requirement to accommodate high-input voltages and switch at high frequencies is challenging for a conventional hard-switched converter based on IGBTs, which makes soft-switching topologies an attractive alternative. This paper presents the design strategy for a zero-voltage switched (ZVS) 6-kW battery charger switching at 20 kHz using IGBTs. This paper illustrates how the design is a tradeoff between managing the hard-switch turn-on losses at light load, minimizing the duty cycle loss caused by soft-switching delays, and minimizing the effects of tail current-switching losses. These tradeoffs affect the selection of the ZVS capacitors, the determination of the series inductance value, the transformer turns ratio, and the selection of the IGBTs to be used. Design details, theoretical predictions, and experimental results are presented in this paper for the conversion system that was developed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267770.pdf","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Soft-Switched 6-kW Battery Charger for Traction Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Soft-Switched 6-kW Battery Charger for Traction Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","volume":"22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267770/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617352","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Soft-Switched 6-kW Battery Charger for Traction Applications","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-mcgrath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049693S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":4267771,"authors":[{"name":"Vctor M.

The technique utilizes very simple hardware, where the switching frequency of a SMPS is dynamically varied over a controlled range. This is achieved by changing the supply voltage of a ring-oscillator based digital pulse-width modulator in a pseudo-random fashion, through 128 discrete steps. The change is performed with a 1-b DeltaSigma digital-to-analog converter. Compensator design guidelines for this variable frequency system are provided for obtaining good dynamic response.

In a closed-loop induction motor drive, eccentricity related fault characteristic harmonics are introduced into both stator current and voltage spectra due to the low-pass filtering property in PI controllers. Therefore, both stator current and voltage harmonics need to be monitored simultaneously. However, a rotor position dependent load torque oscillation has exactly the same effect as a rotor eccentricity fault on the spectrum. Harmonics in stator current and voltage spectra resulting from a load oscillation usually have larger magnitudes, which leads to an ambiguity in the detection of rotor eccentricities. This paper develops an effective method to eliminate load oscillation effects for rotor eccentricity detection in a closed-loop vector-controlled induction motor by monitoring eccentricity induced negative sequence information in both stator currents and voltages. A significant advantage of this scheme is its independence on motor parameters. Experimental results validate the efficacy of using the negative sequence indicator. The practical issues involved in separating the eccentricity related negative sequence information from those resulting from a stator inter-turn fault are also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.900542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.900542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4267737/04267786.pdf","startPage":"1543","endPage":"1551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Eliminating Load Oscillation Effects for Rotor Eccentricity Detection in Closed-Loop Drive-Connected Induction Motors","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9606756","htmlLink":"/document/4267786/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminating Load Oscillation Effects for Rotor Eccentricity Detection in Closed-Loop Drive-Connected Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"22tpel04-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064372S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4267737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4267737","articleId":"4267786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267791,"authors":[{"name":"Junhong Zhang","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4267737/4267791/4267791-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junhong Zhang (S'05) received the B.S and M.S. degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively.

In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM operation associated current ripple can be alleviated by interleaving multiphase currents. However, DCM operation tends to increase turnoff loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus, the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turnoff loss a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the nonactive switch and to divert the current into the antiparalleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can be turned on under zero-voltage condition. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a tradeoff between turnon and turnoff losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. According to the suggested design optimization, a 100-kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested.

However, the inherent limits in performance achievable by electronically processing the signal at the output of a nonlinear photodetector have not received the attention they deserve. In this paper, we investigate the information-theoretic limits of electronic signal processing in transmission systems employing direct photodetection and two possible modulation formats: 1 on-off keying (OOK) with nonreturn-to-zero pulses; and 2 optical duobinary modulation (ODBM). The analysis is based on the computation of the information rate, i.e., the maximum achievable data transfer rate, and accounts for the modulation format as well as relevant parameters of the transmission scheme. In particular, we investigate the impact of sampling rate, uncompensated chromatic dispersion (CD), and quantization resolution of the electrical signal at the output of a direct photodetector. For OOK systems, the obtained results show that the optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty entailed by EDC can be limited to about 2 dB at most values of CD of interest in current applications. Moreover, ODBM systems at high values of CD can almost perform as OOK systems at zero CD. For all the considered modulation formats, the obtained results show that the received electrical signal can be sampled at a rate of two samples per bit interval and quantized with a precision of 3 bits per sample to practically achieve the ultimate performance limits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267793","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4267793/04267804.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.899156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.899156","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Electronic Signal Processing in Direct-Detection Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267804/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Electronic Signal Processing in Direct-Detection Optical Communications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267804/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"9616285","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Electronic Signal Processing in Direct-Detection Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"25jlt07-franceschini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161623S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4267793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4267793","articleId":"4267804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4267820,"authors":[{"name":"Howard R.

In the proposed system, instead of using a high-frequency intensity modulator to modulate the optical carrier with an RF signal, we use two laser diodes (LDs) that are phase locked to generate an RF signal, which is then sent to a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) prism to produce different time delays. Since no optical intensity modulator is used, the system can operate at much higher frequencies with a reduced cost. In addition, the use of only two wavelengths eliminates the power-penalty problem caused by chromatic dispersion. In the proposed approach, the wavelengths from the two LDs are phase-locked using a frequency-discriminator-aided OPLL. A TTD beamforming system, using the OPLL in combination with an FBG prism to achieve tunable time delays, is investigated.

Large diameter (250 mum) gold and platinum wire bonding was evaluated for top side electrical contact. Au wire was reliable after 2000 h at 300degC with Ti/Ti:W/Au pads over passivation on the SiC. However, Au wire on Ti/Pt/Au and Pt wire on both Ti/Tl:W/Au and Ti/Pt/Au exhibited passivation fracture with aging. Polyimide has been demonstrated for 2000 h at 300degC in air as a high-voltage passivation layer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267840/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9986649","volume":"30","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Device Packaging Technologies for Extreme Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Device Packaging Technologies for Extreme Environments","sourcePdf":"30tepm03-johnson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09744S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4267835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4267835","articleId":"4267840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267842,"authors":[{"name":"Stanley Y.

Conductive polymeric coil antennas were screen printed onto flexible substrates, and the coil resistances, the inductances, and the S-parameters of the antenna coils were measured and analyzed. The RFID dies were mounted onto the antenna coils and the read ranges were characterized as a function of curvature. The results show that the coil inductance decreased slowly with increasing curvature, and the maximum read range of the tags was markedly reduced with the curvature. The decrease in the coil inductance and the maximum read range were hypothesized to vary with the projected bent coil area instead of the geometric coil area. Experimental results confirmed that the maximum read range of an RFID tag affixed on a curvilinear surface can be predicted by the classical inductive coupling model with the bent projected coil area. On the basis of the experimental and analytical results, a reading reliability factor of two is proposed as a design parameter for flexible RFID tags.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4267842/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9986651","volume":"30","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Printed Polymer-Based RFID Antenna on Curvilinear Surface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Printed Polymer-Based RFID Antenna on Curvilinear Surface","sourcePdf":"30tepm03-leung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038524S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4267835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4267835","articleId":"4267842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267851,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni Aggelogiannaki","affiliation":["Laboratory of Process Control and Informatics, School of Chemical Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4267850/4267851/4267851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eleni Aggelogiannaki received the Diploma in chemical engineering and the M.Sc. degree from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Athens, Greece, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

The algorithm is based on the simulated annealing concept and returns a single solution that corresponds to the lexicographic ordering approach. The algorithm optimizes simultaneously the multiple objectives by assigning a different initial temperature to each one, according to its position in the hierarchy. A major advantage of the proposed method is its low computational cost. This is very critical, particularly, for online applications, where the time that is available for decision making is limited. The method is tested in a number of benchmark problems, which illustrate its ability to find near-optimal solutions even in nonconvex multiobjective optimization problems. The results are comparable with those that are produced by state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The algorithm is further applied to the solution of a large-scale problem that is formulated online, when a multiobjective adaptive model predictive control (MPC) configuration is adopted. This particular control scheme involves an adaptive discrete-time model of the system, which is developed using the radial-basis-function neural-network architecture. A key issue in the success of the adaptation strategy is the introduction of a persistent excitation constraint, which is transformed to a top-priority objective. The overall methodology is applied to the control problem of a pH reactor and proves to be superior to conventional MPC configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9605927","pubMedId":"17702288","htmlLink":"/document/4267851/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Prioritized Multiobjective Optimization\u2014Implementation in an Adaptive Model Predictive Control Configuration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Prioritized Multiobjective Optimization\u2014Implementation in an Adaptive Model Predictive Control Configuration","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb04-aggelogiannaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125798S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4267850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4267850","articleId":"4267851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267861,"authors":[{"name":"Dao-Qing Dai","affiliation":["Center for Computer Vision and Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Computing, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dao-Qing","lastName":"Dai","id":"37361981700"},{"name":"Pong C.

In addition, many such models have been shown to provide better forecasting results than their conventional counterparts. However, since most of these models require complicated matrix computations, this paper proposes the adoption of a multivariate heuristic function that can be integrated with univariate fuzzy time-series models into multivariate models. Such a multivariate heuristic function can easily be extended and integrated with various univariate models. Furthermore, the integrated model can handle multiple variables to improve forecasting results and, at the same time, avoid complicated computations due to the inclusion of multiple variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267864/","volume":"37","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267864/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619853","pubMedId":"17702283","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multivariate Heuristic Model for Fuzzy Time-Series Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multivariate Heuristic Model for Fuzzy Time-Series Forecasting","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb04-huarng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124004S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4267850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4267850","articleId":"4267864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4267870,"authors":[{"name":"Chulhan Lee","affiliation":["Biometrics Engineering Research Center, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4267850/4267870/4267870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chulhan Lee (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Myungji University, Yongin, Korea, in 2000 and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002.

The concept is to transform a biometric signal or feature into a new one for enrollment and matching. For making cancelable fingerprint templates, previous approaches used either the relative position of a minutia to a core point or the absolute position of a minutia in a given fingerprint image. Thus, a query fingerprint is required to be accurately aligned to the enrolled fingerprint in order to obtain identically transformed minutiae. In this paper, we propose a new method for making cancelable fingerprint templates that do not require alignment. For each minutia, a rotation and translation invariant value is computed from the orientation information of neighboring local regions around the minutia. The invariant value is used as the input to two changing functions that output two values for the translational and rotational movements of the original minutia, respectively, in the cancelable template. When a template is compromised, it is replaced by a new one generated by different changing functions. Our approach preserves the original geometric relationships (translation and rotation) between the enrolled and query templates after they are transformed. Therefore, the transformed templates can be used to verify a person without requiring alignment of the input fingerprint images. In our experiments, we evaluated the proposed method in terms of two criteria: performance and changeability. When evaluating the performance, we examined how verification accuracy varied as the transformed templates were used for matching. When evaluating the changeability, we measured the dissimilarities between the original and transformed templates, and between two differently transformed templates, which were obtained from the same original fingerprint. The experimental results show that the two criteria mutually affect each other and can be controlled by varying the control parameters of the changing functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9605930","pubMedId":"17702294","htmlLink":"/document/4267870/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Alignment-Free Cancelable Fingerprint Templates Based on Local Minutiae Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alignment-Free Cancelable Fingerprint Templates Based on Local Minutiae Information","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb04-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085969S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4267850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4267850","articleId":"4267870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267872,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37557384100"},{"name":"Wen-June Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-June","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280462200"},{"name":"Shu-Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Han","lastName":"Yang","id":"37695441000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4267872","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"This correspondence studies the stabilization problem of large-scale Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. A novel stabilization criterion with decentralized parallel distributed compensation (PDC) fuzzy controller is proposed. The criterion contains two inequalities and one negative definite matrix to be satisfied. The effects of all interconnection terms and all decentralized PDC gains are entirely included in the negative definite matrix. The size of the matrix depends on the number of subsystems; the more the number of subsystems is, the larger the size of the matrix is. By using the linear matrix inequality method, the inequalities in the criterion can be solved to synthesize the local feedback gain of each PDC fuzzy controller such that the whole closed-loop large-scale fuzzy system is asymptotically stable. Finally, we give a practical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4267850/04267872.pdf","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.896016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.896016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Stabilization Criterion for Large-Scale T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy control","Linear matrix inequalities","Control systems","Stability","Control system synthesis","Linear feedback control systems","Interconnected systems","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","feedback","fuzzy control","large-scale systems","linear matrix inequalities","multivariable control systems","stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stabilization criterion","large-scale Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","decentralized parallel distributed compensation","fuzzy controller","negative definite matrix","linear matrix inequality","local feedback gain","closed-loop system","asymptotical stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","large-scale systems","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","parallel distributed compensation (PDC)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Fuzzy Logic","Linear Models","Models, Theoretical","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Stabilization Criterion for Large-Scale T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9609804","pubMedId":"17702304","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Stabilization Criterion for Large-Scale T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb04-lin2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044095S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4267850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"36","articleId":"4267872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267878,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Saadatmand-Tarzjan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran","Department of Electrical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4267850/4267878/4267878-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Saadatmand-Tarzjan was born in Iran, in 1980.

CONN uses a feedback structure similar to Hopfield-type neural networks and a competitive training algorithm similar to the Kohonen-type self-organizing maps (K-SOMs). Consequently, CONN is composed of a constructive part, which grows the tour and an optimizer part to optimize it. In the training algorithm, an initial tour is created first and introduced to CONN. Then, it is trained in the constructive phase for adding a number of cities to the tour. Next, the training algorithm switches to the optimizer phase for optimizing the current tour by displacing the tour cities. After convergence in this phase, the training algorithm switches to the constructive phase anew and is continued until all cities are added to the tour. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of TSP cities and the number of cities to be added in each constructive phase. CONN was tested on nine sets of benchmark TSPs from TSPLIB to demonstrate its performance and efficiency. It performed better than several typical Neural networks (NNs), including KNIES_TSP_Local, KNIES_TSP_Global, Budinich's SOM, Co-Adaptive Net, and multivalued Hopfield network as wall as computationally comparable variants of the simulated annealing algorithm, in terms of both CPU time and accuracy. Furthermore, CONN converged considerably faster than expanding SOM and evolved integrated SOM and generated shorter tours compared to KNIES_DECOMPOSE. Although CONN is not yet comparable in terms of accuracy with some sophisticated computationally intensive algorithms, it converges significantly faster than they do. Generally speaking, CONN provides the best compromise between CPU time and accuracy among currently reported NNs for TSP. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2006.888421","startPage":"754","endPage":"770","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4267850/04267878.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2006.888421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Constructive-Optimizer Neural Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Traveling salesman problems","Cities and towns","Hopfield neural networks","Switches","Neurofeedback","Self organizing feature maps","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive algorithms","neural nets","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constructive-optimizer neural network","traveling salesman problem","competitive training algorithm","TSP cities","Hopfield-type neural network","Kohonen-type self-organizing maps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constructive-optimizer neural network (CONN)","Hopfield-type neural networks (HNNs)","Kohonen-type self-organizing maps (K-SOMs)","traveling salesman problem (TSP)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Decision Support Techniques","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Problem Solving"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Constructive-Optimizer Neural Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem","volume":"37","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267878/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607647","pubMedId":"17702277","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Constructive-Optimizer Neural Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb04-saadatmandtarzjan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225525S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4267850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4267850","articleId":"4267878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4267887,"authors":[{"name":"Jesus Acero","affiliation":["University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain","Aragon Institute for Engineering Research (I3A)"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4267887/4267887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Acero (M'06) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 1992 and 2005, respectively.","From 1992 to 2000, he worked on several industry projects, particularly in custom power supplies for research laboratories.

Sensing of wide-frequency-bandwidth force information is required in achieving the transferring of a keen tactile sensation. A bilateral controller based on acceleration control with disturbance observers is available to achieve transfer of a keen tactile sensation. In this bilateral controller, the frequency bandwidth of sensed force is determined by the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter used in the disturbance observer. The cutoff frequency is in inverse proportion to a sampling period. Therefore, shortening of the sampling period improves performance of bilateral teleoperation. In this paper, a bilateral-teleoperation system using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is introduced. The FPGA is an large scale integration where a user can design its internal logic. When the motion controller is implemented on an FPGA, it operates faster than that implemented in a personal computer with a real-time operating system. The sampling period is shortened from 100 to 10 mus by using an FPGA. The implemented controller is evaluated by experiments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04267889.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Performances in Bilateral Teleoperation by Using FPGA","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Performances in Bilateral Teleoperation by Using FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608226","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4267889/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Performances in Bilateral Teleoperation by Using FPGA","sourcePdf":"54tie04-ishii.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06062S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4267889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267890,"authors":[{"name":"Anne-Marie Lienhardt","affiliation":["LAPLACE-Laboratoire Plasma et Conversion dEnergie Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4267890/4267890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anne-Marie Lienhardt received the B.Eng. degree with honors in electrical engineering from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes d'Ing\u00e9nieur de Lille, Lille, France, in 2003.

This particular topology relies on the use of flying capacitors so as to equally share the voltage constraint on several semiconductors and increase the number of output levels. However, the SMC appropriate operation is guaranteed by the stability of the flying capacitor voltage levels, and the current flow creates variations of those quantities. The idea is therefore to develop an accurate estimation technique that avoids the utilization of differential sensors and allows the active control of the intermediate voltages. The observation has to meet several criteria. It must particularly reproduce in a quasi-analog way the dynamic of those quantities to enable the proper operation of the active control algorithm. The actual research scope thus focuses on the sliding mode observation of the flying capacitor voltages by means of phase current measurements. This paper summarizes the observer design, its digitizing, and the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. It also presents an interesting Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL)-Saber Cosimulation tool that allows validating the VHDL code before being downloaded in the FPGA of the physical system. The last section illustrates and emphasizes the performance and ruggedness of the implemented algorithm through promising experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04267890.pdf","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267890/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Digital Sliding-Mode Observer Implementation Using FPGA","volume":"54","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9608227","htmlLink":"/document/4267890/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Sliding-Mode Observer Implementation Using FPGA","sourcePdf":"54tie04-lienhardt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092803S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4267890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267891,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["SATIE, Cergy-Pontoise University, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4267891/4267891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Monmasson (M'97\u2013SM'06) received the Ing. and Ph.D. degrees from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs d'Electrotechnique d'Electronique d'Informatique et d'Hydraulique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 1989 and 1993, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and Head of the Institut Universitaire Professionnalis\u00e9 de G\u00e9nie Electrique et d'Informatique Industrielle (IUP GEII), University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France.

They enable a holistic functional approach with the major advantage of setting up a unique modeling and evaluation environment for complete industrial electronics systems. Three main design rules are then presented. These are algorithm refinement, modularity, and systematic search for the best compromise between the control performance and the architectural constraints. An overview of contributions and limits of FPGAs is also given, followed by a short survey of FPGA-based intelligent controllers for modern industrial systems. Finally, two complete and timely case studies are presented to illustrate the benefits of an FPGA implementation when using the proposed system modeling and design methodology.

The vibration of the object under acoustic excitation gives rise to a frequency modulated scattered field which depends on both the object and electromagnetic and acoustic source parameters. The objective of this study is to accurately calculate the Doppler spectrum of the bistatic scattered field which is usually orders of magnitude smaller than the fundamental component of the scattered field (the stationary target response). In this analysis the recently developed sheet boundary conditions are used to set up a duplicate problem of a stationary object having time varying sheet impedance and admittance accounting for the object vibration. The problem is formulated using the two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method in an iterative scheme in order to find the broadband response of the scattered field Doppler component. Two-dimensional analytical solutions for a canonical geometry are used to verify the FDTD simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4267893/04267896.pdf","startPage":"1991","endPage":"1998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.900286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.900286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using Sheet Boundary Conditions and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Acoustic scattering","Acoustic waves","Lighting","Frequency modulation","Scattering parameters","Electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustoelectric effects","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","magnetoacoustic effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acousto-electromagnetic wave interaction","electromagnetic wave scattering","seismic illumination","acoustic illumination","frequency modulated scattered field","Doppler spectrum","bistatic scattered field","sheet boundary conditions","time varying sheet impedance","time varying sheet admittance","FDTD method","two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic","Doppler spectra","electromagnetic scattering","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using Sheet Boundary Conditions and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4267896/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607634","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using Sheet Boundary Conditions and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"55tap07-buerkle.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056923S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4267893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4267893","articleId":"4267896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4267901,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4267893/4267901/4267901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Ding was born in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China, on November 12, 1981.

Although materials characterized by the Debye permittivity model can be analyzed accurately and efficiently using well established methods, the treatment of other types of frequency dependence is more difficult. This paper proposes the use of a weighted sum of Debye functions to approximate more general complex permittivity functions. A combination of the particle swarm optimization method and linear least squares optimization is used to find the relaxation frequencies and weights in the expansion, which can then be accommodated in the FDTD method using one of the established methods. Two key advantages of the proposed approach are that the relaxation frequencies are bandlimited and the weights are always positive. These two characteristics help to maintain the accuracy and stability of the FDTD solution. It is also shown that the correlation between the imaginary parts of two Debye functions is the same as that between the real parts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4267893/04267905.pdf","startPage":"1999","endPage":"2005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.900230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.900230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Debye Function Expansions of Complex Permittivity Using a Hybrid Particle Swarm-Least Squares Optimization Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permittivity","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dispersion","Frequency dependence","Least squares approximation","Particle swarm optimization","Least squares methods","Optimization methods","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive media","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","particle swarm optimisation","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Debye function expansion","complex permittivity","finite-difference time-domain method","particle swarm optimization","linear least squares optimization","relaxation frequencies","FDTD method","linear isotropic dispersive media","electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersive media","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","least squares methods","particle swarm optimization","permittivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Debye Function Expansions of Complex Permittivity Using a Hybrid Particle Swarm-Least Squares Optimization Approach","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4267905/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606738","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Debye Function Expansions of Complex Permittivity Using a Hybrid Particle Swarm-Least Squares Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"55tap07-kelley.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059561S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4267893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4267893","articleId":"4267905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267909,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Kosmas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","Department of Electronic Engineering, King''s College, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4267893/4267909/4267909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Panagiotis Kosmas (S'03\u2013M'05) received the Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","From January 2000 until February 2005, he worked as a Research Assistant at the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems, Northeastern University.

First, the effect of certain aspects of the FDTD modeling in the modal analysis of complex waves is studied in detail. Then, the FDTD model is used for the dispersion analysis of the antenna of interest. The calculated values of the leaky-wave attenuation constants suggest that, for an antenna of this type and moderate length, a significant amount of power reaches the edges of the antenna, and thus diffraction can play an important role. To test the validity of our dispersion analysis, measured radiation patterns of a fabricated prototype are presented and compared with those predicted by a leaky-wave approach based on the periodic FDTD results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4267893/04267909.pdf","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.900233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.900233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic FDTD Analysis of a 2-D Leaky-Wave Planar Antenna Based on Dipole Frequency Selective Surfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Planar arrays","Frequency selective surfaces","Modal analysis","Dipole antennas","Attenuation","Diffraction","Testing","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis","frequency selective surfaces","leaky wave antennas","modal analysis","planar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD analysis","2D leaky-wave planar antenna","dipole frequency selective surfaces","FDTD modeling","complex waves modal analysis","dispersion analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","frequency selective surface (FSS)","leaky-wave antenna (LWA)","periodic structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Periodic FDTD Analysis of a 2-D Leaky-Wave Planar Antenna Based on Dipole Frequency Selective Surfaces","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4267909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607635","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic FDTD Analysis of a 2-D Leaky-Wave Planar Antenna Based on Dipole Frequency Selective Surfaces","sourcePdf":"55tap07-kosmas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090498S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4267893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4267893","articleId":"4267909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4267912,"authors":[{"name":"Angus C.

The uniqueness of the antenna designs are that they allow various groups of their operating frequency bands to be selected electronically. In particular, each group of frequency bands, or mode, can be made to serve several different communication systems simultaneously. These systems may include various combinations of GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, Bluetooth, and wireless local-area network (LAN). Therefore, by electronically selecting different antenna modes, a variety of communication systems can be conveniently served by only one antenna. One advantage is that through the different operational modes, the total antenna volume can be reused, and therefore the overall antenna can be made compact. In these designs, the selection of the different modes is achieved by either i) switching different feeding locations of the antenna (switched feed) or ii) switching or breaking of the antenna's connection to the ground (switched ground). This paper demonstrates these two designs. For the first design of switched feed, it can support GSM, DCS, PCS, and UMTS. In the second design, the antenna makes use of a switched-ground technique, which can cover GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, Bluetooth, and 2.4 GHz wireless LAN. The designs are investigated when ideal switches and also various realistic active switches based on PIN diodes, GaAs field effect transistor, and MEMs configurations. The designs are verified through both numerical simulations and measurement of an experimental prototype. The results confirm good performance of the two multiband reconfigurable antenna designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4267893/04267912.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.895634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.895634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4267912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Multiband Antenna Designs for Wireless Communication Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","GSM","Distributed control","Personal communication networks","3G mobile communication","Frequency","Bluetooth","Wireless LAN","Local area networks","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna feeds","Bluetooth","cellular radio","multifrequency antennas","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact reconfigurable multiband antennas","wireless communication devices","mobile communication devices","antenna feeding locations","switched feed","GSM","DCS","PCS","UMTS","Bluetooth","wireless LAN","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Planar inverted F-antenna (PIFA)","reconfigurable antennas","volume reuse","wireless communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Multiband Antenna Designs for Wireless Communication Devices","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4267912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616362","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Multiband Antenna Designs for Wireless Communication Devices","sourcePdf":"55tap07-mak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103171S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4267893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4267893","articleId":"4267912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4267917,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Mias","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Warwick University, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4267893/4267917/4267917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christos Mias (M'96) received the B.Eng. degree (first-class honors) in electronic and communication engineering from Bath University, Bath, U.K., in 1991 and the Ph.D. degree from Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K., in 1995.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., where he leads the Applied Electromagnetics and High-Frequency Telecommunications Laboratory.

Tunability is achieved by connecting adjacent patches with varactor diodes thus altering the capacitance between the patches and hence the surface's resonance frequency. The varactor diodes are biased with the aid of a resistive grid. The grid is made resistive using surface mount resistors. Using an approximate equivalent circuit the effect of the varactor diode resistance is investigated for normal plane wave incidence. It is shown that at resonance, a small varactor resistance may lead to a significant absorption.

It is also increasingly growing. For easier use of the Web, Web search engines (WSEs) are being used frequently. However, there is little information about the characteristics of the Web and also WSEs. One usual way to analysis these characteristics is to use a uniform sample. In such approaches, instead of working on the entire Web we can work on a small subset of the Web representing entire Web. In this paper, we propose a new method, called bucket-based sampling (BBS), to gather this small but uniform subset of the Web. The analyses show that BBS improves the samples' uniformity, at least 6.95% respecting PAGERANK-SMP, one of the best existing methods. Using samples gathered by BBS, we compare the relative size of seven famous WSEs. We also estimate some important characteristics of the Web. For example we estimate that the size of indexable Web is around 20.14 billion pages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4267982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4267982/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9719124","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the Web Using a New Uniform Sampling Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the Web Using a New Uniform Sampling Approach","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"COMSWA07-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0506S","chronDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267954","isNumber":"4267955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267954","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4267955","articleId":"4267982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4268002,"authors":[{"name":"Harish Reddy","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Research Group, Tata Consultancy Services, Bangalore, INDIA"],"firstName":"Harish","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37699476000"},{"name":"M.Girish Chandra","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Research Group, Tata Consultancy Services, Bangalore, INDIA"],"firstName":"M.Girish","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37408874100"},{"name":"P.

The allocation of the same channels in neighbor cells cause inter-cell interference, so the channel allocation needs to be taken carefully to lower the inter-cell interference. For channel allocation, we consider two types of approach: centralized and distributed. In centralized approach, there exists a central server for channel allocation. This approach gives optimal allocation results, but requires a lot of information exchanges and calculations. In this paper, under the assumption of static users, we tackle a channel allocation problem by using the centralized approach and propose heuristic algorithms that require low complexity. Our proposed algorithms show good performance in terms of throughput and power consumption compared to the other centralized schemes. Our algorithms of power allocation with fixed increase (PAFI) and rate allocation with fixed increase (RAFI) show 2 to 3% lower throughput compared to the optimal scheme while they reduce the power consumption by up to 40%. Our schemes show approximately 10% more throughput and 70% less power consumption compared to the scheme of frequency reuse factor 1 that is fully distributed. In distributed approach, each cell independently tries to allocate channels to lower the interference level without using a centralized server. We sketch a way of dynamic channel allocation considering the interference range for our distributed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267954/4267955/04268040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware","doi":"10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4268040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel allocation considering the interference range in multi-cell OFDMA downlink systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Downlink","Throughput","Energy consumption","Wireless networks","Frequency conversion","Radiofrequency interference","Radio control","Control systems","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","code division multiple access","frequency division multiple access","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell OFDMA downlink system","wireless network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","intercell interference control","radio resource management","centralized channel allocation","distributed channel allocation","information exchange","static users","power consumption","power allocation","rate allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Channel allocation considering the interference range in multi-cell OFDMA downlink systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4268040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9719175","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel allocation considering the interference range in multi-cell OFDMA downlink systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"COMSWA07-00-85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047881S","chronDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267954","isNumber":"4267955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267954","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4267955","articleId":"4268040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4268065,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cai","id":"37701011100"},{"name":"Changsheng Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Changsheng","lastName":"Xie","id":"37289552900"},{"name":"Guangxi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guangxi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281082400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0613-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4268065","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":248},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4268065","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Scalability","Laboratories","File servers","Throughput","Concurrent computing","Genetic mutations","Costs","Application software","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["replicated databases","software reliability","storage area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EDRFS","effective distributed replication file system","small-file application","data-intensive application","metadata server","multiple storage nodes","file data caches","replicas consistency method","namespace operation bottleneck","reliability","cluster storage systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["storage area network","reliability","distributed systems","cluster storage systems","file systems","replication systemes"]}],"abstract":"With the system scale keeping grown, the key challenge is to mask the failures that arise among the system components and to improve the performance of data-intensive applications. This paper designs and implements a cluster-based distributed replication file system EDRFS to meet these critical demands. EDRFS works with a single metadata server and multiple storage nodes, deploys whole-file replication scheme at the file level, and tracks what storage node a file is replicated on. We use a linear hash algorithm to evenly distribute data and load across multiple storage nodes so as to achieve balancing workload and incremental scalability of throughput and storage capacity as the system scale grows. In addition, we employ metadata caches and file data caches in clients to enhance system performance. Furthermore, we deploy a concurrency lock scheme to avoid namespace operation bottleneck and a replicas consistency method to keep a consistent mutation order among replicas of a file. We provide the initial experimental evaluations of our prototypical system on a small-file and data-intensive workload.","doi":"10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382422","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267954/4267955/04268065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EDRFS: An Effective Distributed Replication File System for Small-File and Data-Intensive Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"EDRFS: An Effective Distributed Replication File System for Small-File and Data-Intensive Application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9719171","htmlLink":"/document/4268065/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EDRFS: An Effective Distributed Replication File System for Small-File and Data-Intensive Application","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"COMSWA07-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080104S","chronDate":"7-12 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267954","isNumber":"4267955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4267954","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4267955","articleId":"4268065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4268093,"authors":[{"name":"Jyothiram Kasturi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Jyothiram","lastName":"Kasturi","id":"37691529200"},{"name":"Rajesh Sundaresan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Sundaresan","id":"37268314000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0613-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4268093","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Upper bound","Timing","Bandwidth","Clocks","Mobile handsets","Computational complexity","ISDN","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","resource allocation","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequence design","symbol-asynchronous chip-synchronous CDMA system","resource allocation","nonoversized system","nonspread system","N orthogonal sequences","optimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous","code division multiple access","resource allocation","sum capacity","uplink"]}],"abstract":"Sequence design and resource allocation for a symbol-asynchronous chip-synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) system is considered in this paper.

Analogous to the synchronous case, by splitting oversized users in a system with processing gain N, a system with no oversized users is easily obtained, and the lower bound on sum power (upper bound on sum rate, respectively) is shown to be achieved by using N orthogonal sequences.

We search for colluding behavior by examining complete user logs, and incrementally refine a set of collusion detectors to identify common collusion patterns.

Such modules could lead to faults, and as such, may be in need of mitigating actions such as refactoring or more exhaustive testing. Source code metrics can be used as input features for a classifier, however, there exist a large number of measures that capture different aspects of coupling, cohesion, inheritance, complexity and size. In a large dimensional feature space some of the metrics may be irrelevant or redundant. Feature selection is the process of identifying a subset of the attributes that improves a classifier's discriminatory performance. This paper presents initial results of a genetic algorithm as a feature subset selection method that enhances a classifier's ability to discover cognitively complex classes that degrade program understanding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268267/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10290062","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4268267/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Use of a Genetic Algorithm to Identify Source Code Metrics Which Improves Cognitive Complexity Predictive Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of a Genetic Algorithm to Identify Source Code Metrics Which Improves Cognitive Complexity Predictive Models","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"28600297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043099S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4268224","isNumber":"4268225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4268224","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4268225","articleId":"4268267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4268280,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Examples of such systems include certain large scale process control systems, chains of coupled oscillators and supply chain management systems. Receding horizon control (RHC) is a method of choice in these venues as constraints can be explicitly accommodated. In addition, a distributed control approach is sought to enable the autonomy of the individual subsystems and reduce the computational burden of centralized implementations. In this paper, a distributed RHC algorithm is presented for dynamically coupled nonlinear systems that are subject to decoupled input constraints. By this algorithm, each subsystem computes its own control locally. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithm is guaranteed at every update, and asymptotic stabilization is established. The theoretical conditions for feasibility and stability are shown to be satisfied for a set of coupled Van der Pol oscillators that model a walking robot experiment. In simulations, distributed and centralized receding horizon controllers are employed for stabilization of the oscillators. The numerical experiments show that the controllers perform comparably, while the computational savings of the distributed implementation over the centralized implementation is clearly demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Receding Horizon Control of Dynamically Coupled Nonlinear Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.900828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4268363/04268375.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.900828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4268375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Receding Horizon Control of Dynamically Coupled Nonlinear Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4268375/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9609755","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Receding Horizon Control of Dynamically Coupled Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"52tac07-dunbar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114855S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4268363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"4268363","articleId":"4268375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4268388,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo C.

A systematic procedure to construct a family of finite-dimensional LMI relaxations is provided. The robust stability is assessed by means of the existence of a Lyapunov function, more specifically, a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent Lyapunov (HPPDL) function of arbitrary degree. For a given degree , if an HPPDL solution exists, a sequence of relaxations based on real algebraic properties provides sufficient LMI conditions of increasing precision and constant number of decision variables for the existence of an HPPDL function which tend to the necessity. Alternatively, if an HPPDL solution of degree exists, a sequence of relaxations which increases the number of variables and the number of LMIs will provide an HPPDL solution of larger degree. The method proposed can be applied to determine homogeneous parameter-dependent matrix solutions to a wide variety of PD-LMIs by transforming the infinite-dimensional LMI problem described in terms of uncertain parameters belonging to the unit simplex in a sequence of finite-dimensional LMI conditions which converges to the necessary conditions for the existence of a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent solution of arbitrary degree. Illustrative examples show the efficacy of the proposed conditions when compared with other methods from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.900848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4268363/04268388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.900848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268363","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter-Dependent LMIs in Robust Analysis: Characterization of Homogeneous Polynomially Parameter-Dependent Solutions Via LMI Relaxations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4268388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter-Dependent LMIs in Robust Analysis: Characterization of Homogeneous Polynomially Parameter-Dependent Solutions Via LMI Relaxations","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617265","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4268388/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter-Dependent LMIs in Robust Analysis: Characterization of Homogeneous Polynomially Parameter-Dependent Solutions Via LMI Relaxations","sourcePdf":"52tac07-oliveira-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072509S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4268363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"308","xplore-issue":"4268363","articleId":"4268388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4268394,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37421793800"},{"name":"Tongwen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Tongwen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4268394","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":372,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2384},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4268394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Stability","Control systems","History","Linear systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Stochastic systems","Real time systems","Cost function","Switching systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","Markov processes","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic stability","linear matrix inequalities","Markov chains","multiple-packet transmissions","networked control systems stability","packet dropouts","networked control systems design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov chains","networked control systems (NCSs)","packet dropout","stochastic stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.900839","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4268363/04268394.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.900839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Networked Control Systems With Packet Dropouts","abstract":"This note is concerned with stability and controller design of networked control systems (NCSs) with packet dropouts.

Spatial contrast is computed as the ratio between pixel photocurrent and a local average between neighboring pixels obtained with a diffuser network. This current-based computation produces an important amount of mismatch between neighboring pixels, because the currents can be as low as a few pico-amperes. Consequently, a compact calibration circuitry has been included to trimm each pixel. Measurements show a reduction in mismatch standard deviation from 57% to 6.6% (indoor light). The paper describes the design of the pixel with its spatial contrast computation and calibration sections. About one third of pixel area is used for a 5-bit calibration circuit. Area of pixel is 58 mum times 56 mum , while its current consumption is about 20 nA at 1-kHz event rate.

The techniques are based on the basic RNMC and show an inherent advantage over traditional compensation strategies, especially for heavy capacitive loads. Moreover, they are implemented without entailing extra transistors, thus saving circuit complexity and power consumption. A well-defined design procedure, introducing phase margin as main design parameter, is also developed for each solution. To verify the effectiveness of the techniques, two amplifiers have been fabricated in a standard 0.5-mum CMOS process. Experimental measurements are found in good agreement with theoretical analysis and show an improvement in small-signal and large-signal amplifier performances. Finally, an analytical comparison with the nonreversed counterparts topologies, which shows the superiority of the proposed solutions, is also included.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.900170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.900170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4268395/04268405.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in Reversed Nested Miller Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Advances in Reversed Nested Miller Compensation","volume":"54","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4268405/","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9613051","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268405/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in Reversed Nested Miller Compensation","sourcePdf":"54tcsi07-grasso.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069646S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4268395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4268395","articleId":"4268405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4268406,"authors":[{"name":"Gerrit Groenewold","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4268395/4268406/4268406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerrit Groenewold received the Ir. and Ph.D. degrees from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, where he developed a formal design theory for integrated active filters.","Between 1992 and 1997, he worked in the Mass Storage Division of Philips Semiconductors, Sunnyvale, CA, and Philips Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

Two cases of time-varying delays are fully considered; one is the time-varying delay being continuous uniformly bounded while the other is the time-varying delay being differentiable uniformly bounded with the derivative of the delay bounded by a constant. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, some delay-dependent synchronization criteria are first obtained and formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The relationship between synchronization criteria for the two cases of time-varying delays is built. Then, sufficient conditions on the existence of a time-varying delay feedback controller are derived by employing these newly-obtained synchronization criteria. The controller gains can be achieved by solving a set of LMIs. Finally, Chua's circuit is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9613053","volume":"54","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4268407/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Designing Time-Varying Delay Feedback Controllers for Master\u2013Slave Synchronization of Lur'e Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Designing Time-Varying Delay Feedback Controllers for Master\u2013Slave Synchronization of Lur'e Systems","sourcePdf":"54tcsi07-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06383S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4268395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4268395","articleId":"4268407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4268412,"authors":[{"name":"Thian Mury","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications, and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4268395/4268412/4268412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thian Mury received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering (summa cum laude) from Atma Jaya University, Jakarta, Indonesia, and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Delft University of Technology (TUDelft), Delft, The Netherlands, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

The battery powered RFID IC can also work as a passive RFID tag without a battery or when the battery has died (i.e., voltage has dropped below 1.3 V); this novel dual passive and battery operation allays one of the major drawbacks of currently available active tags, namely that the tag cannot be used once the battery has died. When powered by a battery, the current consumption is 700 nA at 1.5 V (400 nA if internal signals are not brought out on test pads). This ultra-low-power consumption permits the use of a very small capacity battery of 100 mA-hr for lifetimes exceeding ten years; as a result a battery tag that is very close to a passive tag both in form factor and cost is made possible. The chip is built on a 1-mum digital CMOS process with dual poly layers, EEPROM and Schottky diodes. The RF threshold power at 2.45 GHz is -19 dBm which is the lowest ever reported threshold power for RFID tags and has a range exceeding 3.5 m under FCC unlicensed operation at the 2.4-GHz microwave band. The low threshold is achieved with architectural choices and low-power circuit design techniques. At 915 MHz, based on the experimentally measured tag impedance (92-j837) and the threshold spec of the tag (200 mV), the theoretical minimum range is 24 m. The tag initially is in a \"low-power\" mode to conserve power and when issued the appropriate command, it operates in \"full-power\" mode. The chip has on-chip voltage regulators, clock and data recovery circuits, EEPROM and a digital state machine that implements the ISO 18000-4 B protocol in the \"full-power\" mode. We provide detailed explanation of the clock recovery circuits and the implementation of the binary sort algorithm, which includes a pseudorandom number generator. Other than the antenna board and a battery, no external components are used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4268395/04268418.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.897768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.897768","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ultra-Low-Power Long Range Battery/Passive RFID Tag for UHF and Microwave Bands With a Current Consumption of 700 nA at 1.5 V","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268418/","displayDocTitle":"An Ultra-Low-Power Long Range Battery/Passive RFID Tag for UHF and Microwave Bands With a Current Consumption of 700 nA at 1.5 V","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4268418/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"9605926","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultra-Low-Power Long Range Battery/Passive RFID Tag for UHF and Microwave Bands With a Current Consumption of 700 nA at 1.5 V","sourcePdf":"54tcsi07-pillai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110951S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4268395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4268395","articleId":"4268418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4268419,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Samadi","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA","Advanced Micro Device Inc, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4268395/4268419/4268419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Samadi received the B.Sc. degree from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, the M.Sc. degree from Tehran University, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, in electrical engineering, in 1992, 1996, and 2006, respectively.","From 1992 to 1993, he was with the research center of Isfahan University of Technology as a Hardware Design Engineer.

This methodology makes it possible to analyze only those parts of the analysis domain that are supposed to evolve in order to satisfy the design specifications.

The distributed phase shifter is implemented using distributed active switches that consist of a periodic placement of series inductors and cascode transistors, thereby obtaining linear phase shift versus frequency with a digital control. The design guideline of the distributed phase shifter is presented. The 4-bit phase shifter achieves 3.5 plusmn 0.5 dB of gain, with an rms phase error of 2.6deg at a center frequency of 12.1 GHz.

Given that the isolation of the branch-line hybrid coupler is 21.5 dB, the enhancement of the isolation is expected to be 13.77 dB. A quadrature Doppler radar front-end with the canceller was implemented. The noise level in the mixer output is lower by 9 dB compared with that of a conventional quadrature radar. This radar can measure speed as low as 0.76 mm/s, which correspond to a 0.12-Hz Doppler shift. It is also able to detect signs of the Doppler shift from a moving target due to its quadrature topology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar applications","Topology","Doppler radar","Couplers","Bandwidth","Doppler shift","Delay lines","Noise level","Radar measurements","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay lines","Doppler radar","Doppler shift","radar applications","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature radar topology","Tx leakage canceller","branch-line hybrid couplers","delay line","Wilkinson combiner","quadrature Doppler radar front-end","Doppler shift","frequency 24 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadrature radar","radar sensor","velocity measurement"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4268421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.900316","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4268421/04268433.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.900316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quadrature Radar Topology With Tx Leakage Canceller for 24-GHz Radar Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Quadrature Radar Topology With Tx Leakage Canceller for 24-GHz Radar Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9606735","publicationDate":"July 2007","volume":"55","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4268433/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4268433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quadrature Radar Topology With Tx Leakage Canceller for 24-GHz Radar Applications","sourcePdf":"55tmtt07-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045852S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4268421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4268421","articleId":"4268433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4268439,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Ojefors","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4268421/4268439/4268439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik \u00d6jefors (S'01\u2013M'06) was born in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1975.

Numerical simulation results are presented for three types of obstacles: polygons, walls, and combinations of both.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2007.382857","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269829/4269830/04269857.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2007.382857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of smooth path planning for a mobile robot by evolutionary multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of smooth path planning for a mobile robot by evolutionary multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9719261","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4269857/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of smooth path planning for a mobile robot by evolutionary multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"CIRA-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058685S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269829","isNumber":"4269830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269829","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4269830","articleId":"4269857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4269867,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Ferrolho","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department Superior School of Technology of Viseu, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, Viseu, Portugal"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Ferrolho","id":"37300270400"},{"name":"Manuel Crisostomo","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Crisostomo","id":"37300271800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0789-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0790-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4269867","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Artificial neural networks","Simulated annealing","Single machine scheduling","Computational intelligence","Robotics and automation","USA Councils","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible genetic algorithm","job-shop scheduling problem","production scheduling problems","combinational search space"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2007.382867","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269829/4269830/04269867.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2007.382867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid and Flexible Genetic Algorithm for the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem","abstract":"A hybrid and flexible genetic algorithm (HybFlexGA) is presented for the job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP).

Many sensors as well as actuators are based on this phenomenon. Because of the nonlinear character of the piezo phenomenon, exact measuring of fast dynamic systems is difficult with piezoelectric sensors. Piezo-based actuators on the other hand need feedback for the exact motion. This has increased the size of the system as well as the power consumption, which are undesirable characteristics in microworld. In this paper a solution for the problem is determined by modeling. First, a third order transfer function is generated to model the piezoactuator at the operating point. The parameters of a grey box-model are implemented as dynamic, because of the nonlinearity of the piezo actuator. This is the way to capture the characters of the transfer function to fit the real actuator at each operating point. A multilayer perception neural network is used to model the behavior of the system. The training data for the network is measured at different operating points. The model is validated by test data at different operating points. The agreement with the model and the measurements is excellent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269900/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9719304","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4269900/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based modeling of a piezodisk dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based modeling of a piezodisk dynamics","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"CIRA-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059361S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269829","isNumber":"4269830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269829","xplore-issue":"4269830","articleId":"4269900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4269901,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-Chul Choi","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Chul","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277428000"},{"name":"Se-Young Oh","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-Young","lastName":"Oh","id":"37279131000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0789-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0790-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4269901","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269901","abstract":"This paper proposes a technique for real-time recognition of facial Identity and expression which uses the active appearance model (AAM) with efficient second order minimization algorithm and neural network, especially the multilayer perceptron.

This implementation was designed to be an image processing subsystem that is mounted on a MAV to assist an autopilot system with vision-related tasks. This paper describes the FPGA vision system architecture and algorithms implemented to segment and locate a colored cloth target that specifies the exact landing location. Once the target landing site is identified, the exact location of the landing site is transmitted to the autopilot, which then implements the trajectory adjustments required to autonomously land the MAV on the target. Results of two flight test situations are presented. In the first situation, the MAV lands on a static target. The second situation includes a moving target, which in our tests was the back of a moving vehicle. This FPGA system is an application-specific configuration of the helios robotic vision platform developed at Brigham Young University.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2007.382912","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269829/4269830/04269912.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2007.382912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269830","startPage":"125","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Vision System for Precision MAV Targeted Landing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Vision System for Precision MAV Targeted Landing","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269912/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9719316","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4269912/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vision System for Precision MAV Targeted Landing","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"CIRA-00-82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056312S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269829","isNumber":"4269830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269829","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4269830","articleId":"4269912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4269914,"authors":[{"name":"Fusaomi Nagata","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Tokyo University of Science, Sanyo-Onoda, Japan"],"firstName":"Fusaomi","lastName":"Nagata","id":"37329507400"},{"name":"Katsutoshi Kuribayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Tokyo University of Science, Sanyo-Onoda, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsutoshi","lastName":"Kuribayashi","id":"37089042396"},{"name":"Kazuo Kiguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Kiguchi","id":"37279644500"},{"name":"Keigo Watanabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280393800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0789-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0790-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4269914","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269914","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Servomechanisms","Robot control","Torque control","Manipulator dynamics","Computational modeling","Service robots","Acceleration","Computer industry","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","genetic algorithms","industrial manipulators","nonlinear control systems","position control","servomechanisms","simulation","stability","torque control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation","fine gain tuning","genetic algorithm","model-based robotic servo controller","acceleration control","computed torque method","nonlinear control system","industrial manipulator","close loop system","position control","velocity control","control stability","feedback","controller design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2007.382914","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269829/4269830/04269914.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2007.382914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of Fine Gain Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms for Model-Based Robotic Servo Controllers","abstract":"Resolved acceleration control method or computed torque method is used for nonlinear control of industrial manipulators, which is composed of a model base portion and a servo portion. The servo portion is a close loop with respect to the position and velocity. On the other hand, the model base portion has the inertia term, gravity term and centrifugal/Coriolis term, which work for canceling the nonlinearity of manipulator. In order to realize high control stability, the position and velocity gains used in the servo portion should be selected suitably. In this paper, a simple but effective fine tuning method after manual tuning is introduced for the position and velocity feedback gains in the servo portion. At the first step, base values of the gains are roughly selected by a controller designer, e.g., considering the critically damped condition. After that, the base values are finely tuned by genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms search for the better combination of the position and velocity gains. Simulations are conducted using a dynamic model of PUMA560 manipulator to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269914/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9719318","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4269914/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Fine Gain Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms for Model-Based Robotic Servo Controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Fine Gain Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms for Model-Based Robotic Servo Controllers","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"CIRA-00-84.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063906S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269829","isNumber":"4269830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269829","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4269830","articleId":"4269914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4269925,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This is far less informative than the commonly used individual image labels (e.g., \"car model X\"), but it is cheaper to obtain. The proposed algorithm learns the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of \"same\" and \"different\" images. These differences are vector quantized by an ensemble of extremely randomized binary trees, and the similarity measure is computed from the quantized differences. The extremely randomized trees are fast to learn, robust due to the redundant information they carry and they have been proved to be very good clusterers. Furthermore, the trees efficiently combine different feature types (SIFT and geometry). We evaluate our innovative similarity measure on four very different datasets and consistently outperform the state-of-the-art competitive approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04269994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Visual Similarity Measures for Comparing Never Seen Objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Binary trees","Geometry","Humans","Glass","Measurement standards","Euclidean distance","Information retrieval","Stochastic processes","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image recognition","object recognition","trees (mathematics)","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual similarity measures learning","objects comparing","image training","images labelling","vector quantization","randomized binary trees","differences quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning Visual Similarity Measures for Comparing Never Seen Objects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4269994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737838","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Visual Similarity Measures for Comparing Never Seen Objects","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102446S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4269994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4269995,"authors":[{"name":"Herve Jegou","affiliation":["INRIA-LEAR, France"],"firstName":"Herve","lastName":"Jegou","id":"37283909100"},{"name":"Hedi Harzallah","affiliation":["INRIA-LEAR, France"],"firstName":"Hedi","lastName":"Harzallah","id":"37398243700"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["INRIA-LEAR, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4269995","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":610},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Vectors","Velocity measurement","Image retrieval","File systems","Information retrieval","Layout","Voting","Image representation","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image retrieval","iterative methods","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contextual dissimilarity measure","image search system","bag-of-features","visual word vectors","iterative estimation","bag-of-words image retrieval approach","CDM design","clustering-based strategy","unsupervised learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present two contributions to improve accuracy and speed of an image search system based on bag-of-features: a contextual dissimilarity measure (CDM) and an efficient search structure for visual word vectors. Our measure (CDM) takes into account the local distribution of the vectors and iteratively estimates distance correcting terms. These terms are subsequently used to update an existing distance, thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimental results on the Nister-Stewenius dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Our efficient search structure for visual word vectors is a two-level scheme using inverted files. The first level partitions the image set into clusters of images. At query time, only a subset of clusters of the second level has to be searched. This method allows fast querying in large sets of images. We evaluate the gain in speed and the loss in accuracy on large datasets (up to 500k images).","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382970","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04269995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A contextual dissimilarity measure for accurate and efficient image search","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A contextual dissimilarity measure for accurate and efficient image search","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269995/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737839","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4269995/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contextual dissimilarity measure for accurate and efficient image search","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056293S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4269995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4269996,"authors":[{"name":"Simon A.

Our matching algorithm combines the discriminative power of feature correspondences with the descriptive power of matching segments. Co-saliency matching score favors correspondences that are consistent with 'soft' image segmentation as well as with local point feature matching. We express the matching model via a joint image graph (JIG) whose edge weights represent intra-as well as inter-image relations. The dominant spectral components of this graph lead to simultaneous pixel-wise alignment of the images and saliency-based synchronization of 'soft' image segmentation. The co-saliency score function, which characterizes these spectral components, can be directly used as a similarity metric as well as a positive feedback for updating and establishing new point correspondences. We present experiments showing the extraction of matching regions and pointwise correspondences, and the utility of the global image similarity in the context of place recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269998/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9737842","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4269998/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image Matching via Saliency Region Correspondences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Matching via Saliency Region Correspondences","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052278S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4269998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4269999,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Tron","affiliation":["Center for Imaging Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Tron","id":"37398528900"},{"name":"Rene Vidal","affiliation":["Center for Imaging Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37270557800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4269999","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":377,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1032},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Benchmark for the Comparison of 3-D Motion Segmentation Algorithms","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04269999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382974","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion segmentation","Computer vision","Layout","Cameras","Statistical analysis","Databases","Application software","Image segmentation","Benchmark testing","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image segmentation","image sequences","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D motion segmentation algorithm","image sequence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4269999","abstract":"Over the past few years, several methods for segmenting a scene containing multiple rigidly moving objects have been proposed. However, most existing methods have been tested on a handful of sequences only, and each method has been often tested on a different set of sequences. Therefore, the comparison of different methods has been fairly limited. In this paper, we compare four 3D motion segmentation algorithms for affine cameras on a benchmark of 155 motion sequences of checkerboard, traffic, and articulated scenes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4269999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737843","htmlLink":"/document/4269999/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Benchmark for the Comparison of 3-D Motion Segmentation Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Benchmark for the Comparison of 3-D Motion Segmentation Algorithms","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073736S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"377","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4269999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
