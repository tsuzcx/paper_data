Several IB composites were fabricated with different commercial and experimental piezoelectric ceramics and evaluated to determine a suitable formulation for use in high-frequency linear arrays. It was found that the fabricated fine-scale 2-2 IB composites outperformed 1-3 IB composites with identical pillar- and kerf-widths. This result was not expected and lead to the conclusion that dicing damage was likely the cause of the discrepancy. Ultimately, a 2-2 composite fabricated using a fine-grain piezoelectric ceramic was chosen for the array. The composite was manufactured using one IB operation in the azimuth direction to produce approximately 19-\u03bcm-wide pillars separated by 6-\u03bcm-wide kerfs. The array had a 50 \u03bcm (one wavelength in water) azimuth pitch, two matching layers, and 2 mm elevation length focused to 7.3 mm using a polymethylpentene (TPX) lens. The measured pulse-echo center frequency for a representative array element was 28 MHz and -6-dB bandwidth was 61%. The measured single-element transmit -6-dB directivity was estimated to be 50\u00b0. The measured insertion loss was 19 dB after compensating for the effects of attenuation and diffraction in the water bath. A fine-wire phantom was used to assess the lateral and axial resolution of the array when paired with a prototype system utilizing a 64-channel analog beamformer. The -6-dB lateral and axial resolutions were estimated to be 125 and 68 \u03bcm, respectively. An anechoic cyst phantom was also imaged to determine the minimum detectable spherical inclusion, and thus the 3-D resolution of the array and beamformer. The minimum anechoic cyst detected was approximately 300 \u03bcm in diameter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6039985/06040010.pdf","startPage":"2202","endPage":"2212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6039985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-frequency linear ultrasonic array utilizing an interdigitally bonded 2-2 piezo-composite","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Ceramics","Electrodes","Finite element methods","Acoustics","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioceramics","biomedical ultrasonics","composite materials","phantoms","piezoceramics","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency linear ultrasonic array","fine-scale interdigitally bonded 2-2 piezocomposite","pillar-width","kerf-width","dicing damage","fine-grain piezoelectric ceramic","interdigitally bonded operation","azimuth direction","azimuth pitch","matching layers","elevation length","polymethylpentene lens","pulse-echo center frequency","representative array element","insertion loss","attenuation","diffraction","water bath","fine-wire phantom","lateral resolution","axial resolution","analog beamformer","anechoic cyst phantom","minimum detectable spherical inclusion","3D resolution","minimum anechoic cyst"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Cattle","Cysts","Equipment Design","Eye","Models, Biological","Phantoms, Imaging","Transducers","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A high-frequency linear ultrasonic array utilizing an interdigitally bonded 2-2 piezo-composite","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6040010/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12288161","pubMedId":"21989884","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-frequency linear ultrasonic array utilizing an interdigitally bonded 2-2 piezo-composite","sourcePdf":"t11a2202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07839S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6039985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6039985","articleId":"6040010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6040016,"authors":[{"name":"Tyler Harrison","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Tyler","lastName":"Harrison","id":"38243368900"},{"name":"Roger J.

Development of a photoacoustic array system can be accelerated by adapting existing commercial ultrasound systems and harnessing their performance-enhancing aspects such as parallel beamforming. One challenge faced when adapting commercial ultrasound systems for photoacoustic imaging is that the dynamic delay sequences required for focusing must account for one-way rather than two-way ultrasound wave propagation. Modifying the hardware may be difficult for developers and impossible for users, but some ultrasound systems provide a parameter, c: the speed of sound used to calculate these delays. A linear-array based ultrasound platform with parallel channel acquisition is used to compare experimental point-spread functions produced using an ultrasound beamformer with a scaled value of c to those produced by a photoacoustic beamformer. Scaling c by a factor of \u221a2 provides the best image quality compared with adjustments by 1 and 2, but requires image rescaling, which can be done postacquisition or by modification of the rendering software. Although optimal focusing is achieved for linear scanning, this is not the case for sector scanning, which requires angular and depth rescaling.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6039985","startPage":"2259","endPage":"2263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6039985/06040016.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The applicability of ultrasound dynamic receive beamformers to photoacoustic imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6040016/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"The applicability of ultrasound dynamic receive beamformers to photoacoustic imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12288167","pubMedId":"21989890","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The applicability of ultrasound dynamic receive beamformers to photoacoustic imaging","sourcePdf":"t11a2259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085446S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6039985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6039985","articleId":"6040016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6040017,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jin","id":"37898570200"},{"name":"Youming Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Youming","lastName":"Li","id":"37899077300"},{"name":"Xiaoli Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900811200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040017","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040017","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Cognitive radio","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized eigenvalue based detector","cognitive radio systems","primary signal detection","multiple antennas","generalized Rayleigh quotient","uniformly most powerful invariant detector","uncorrelated antennas","correlated antennas"]}],"doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040017","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040017.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Eigenvalue Based Detector for Cognitive Radio Systems","abstract":"In this paper, a generalized eigenvalue based detector is presented for detecting primary signals in cognitive radio systems with multiple antennas.

For linear classification, kernel function is proposed to map the input low dimensional vector into a high dimensional feature space. The paper exploits thoroughly two parameters: the parameter in RBF kernel function and the sampling data dimension.

Furthermore, it has a lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040035","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040035.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Proportional Resource Allocation Algorithm in MIMO-OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040035/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Proportional Resource Allocation Algorithm in MIMO-OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040035/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Proportional Resource Allocation Algorithm in MIMO-OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049244S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040037,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqiang Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xueqiang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37652448700"},{"name":"Jinlong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280540300"},{"name":"Liang Shen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37892570600"},{"name":"Juan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656895000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040037","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Relays","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Network coding","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","network coding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm","network coding","cognitive radio systems","relay selection method","space-time code"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing taking into account the error effect on the sensing information reporting is studied.

A novel iterative detection based on parallel interference cancellation is proposed in this paper. The received signal is first processed with MMSE detector, and the decision estimated vector is obtained, then the ICI item can be reconstructed. With the principle of maximize the minimum signal-to-interference and noise power ratio, the strongest interference item will be replaced. The more iterations is carried out, the more the time diversity over time-varying multipath channels will be exploited. Simulation results show that this iterative detector improves the BER performance significantly. When the normalized Doppler frequency offset is comparably large, the BER of the proposed detection can be more improved. Compared with existing ICI mitigation scheme, the proposed scheme has lower computational complexity and better convergence stability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Cancellation Based Iterative Detection for OFDM Systems over Time-Varying Multipath Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Detectors","Doppler effect","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Doppler shift","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","signal detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative detection","OFDM systems","time-varying multipath channels","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM communication systems","intercarrier interference","parallel interference cancellation","MMSE detector","received signal detection","decision estimated vector","minimum signal-to-interference-noise power ratio","BER performance","normalized Doppler frequency offset","ICI mitigation scheme","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Interference Cancellation Based Iterative Detection for OFDM Systems over Time-Varying Multipath Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302345","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Cancellation Based Iterative Detection for OFDM Systems over Time-Varying Multipath Channels","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055402S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040041,"authors":[{"name":"Yinsheng Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Broadband Wireless Mobile Communications, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinsheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37898534500"},{"name":"Zhenhui Tan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhui","lastName":"Tan","id":"37278529400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040041","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"abstract":"In this paper, a MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) estimation of frequency offset for OFDM is proposed, utilizing the ICI (Inter Carrier Interference).

The CES-PTS scheme reduces the complexity of the constellation extension scheme (CES). Although the CES-PTS scheme has lower IFFT operations than the CES, the signals transmitted by the CES-PTS scheme have no error correction capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified CES-PTS scheme, called BCM-CES-PTS, that combines block coded modulation (BCM) codes with the CES-PTS scheme to improve the error correction capability of the CES-PTS scheme. This study further proposes a new mapping of 16-QAM constellation extension scheme to improve the PAPR performance of the CES scheme. Simulation results show that the BCM-CES-PTS scheme has better PAPR performance than the CES-PTS scheme when the number of subblocks is the same.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Constellation Extension Scheme with Error Correction Capability for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040043","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Constellation Extension Scheme with Error Correction Capability for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040043/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302348","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Constellation Extension Scheme with Error Correction Capability for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07181S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040044,"authors":[{"name":"Qianqian Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qianqian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37896852900"},{"name":"Danpu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danpu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277009500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040044","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":283},"abstract":"An improved method of joint time and frequency offset estimation is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, two neighboring identical pilot symbols are embedded in the frequency domain. Zadoff-Chu sequence is utilized as the pilot symbols for its advantage of ideal autocorrelation property. To overcome the Multipath Fading effect, a new timing metric using the length of CP is applied to ensure that the resultant FFT starting point is located in the middle of the ISI-free CP part. The simulation shows that the proposed method has the better performance than the conventional OFDM symbol timing estimation method in the multipath fading channel especially for the case when the first path isn't the strongest.

The channel estimation techniques for OFDM systems based on pilot arrangement are considered. The combined power-allocation and channel estimation based on comb type pilot arrangement is studied through different strategies .We try to estimate channel at pilot frequencies and power allocation of the subcarriers simultaneously. The combined estimation is based on LS while the channel interpolation is linear interpolation. We show that the traditional water-filling strategy applied in general OFDM systems needs to be modified due to the per subcarrier power constraints in such systems. A smooth water-filling strategy is proposed and show better performance .","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040056.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Estimation of Power Allocation and Channel in OFDM-Based Opportunity Spectrum Access System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Resource management","Estimation","Interpolation","Fading","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","interpolation","OFDM modulation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation techniques","OFDM-based opportunity spectrum access system","power allocation strategy","channel capacity","comb type pilot arrangement","channel interpolation","linear interpolation","water-filling strategy","subcarrier power constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Combined Estimation of Power Allocation and Channel in OFDM-Based Opportunity Spectrum Access System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302361","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Estimation of Power Allocation and Channel in OFDM-Based Opportunity Spectrum Access System","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032576S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040057,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, ChengDu, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37896965600"},{"name":"Xu He","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, ChengDu, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"He","id":"37407012400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040057","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Frequency modulation","Spread spectrum communication","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency conversion","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","AFH_OFDM system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","mobile communication","adaptive frequency hopping","BER performance","broadband uniform noise","interferences","4G","multipath Rayleigh fading channel"]}],"abstract":"OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) is the key technology to 4G in the field of mobile communication.

Many theoretical studies of the different ICI-cancellation schemes have been reported earlier by many authors. The need for experimental verification of the theoretically predicted results in 2.4 GHz frequency band is important. One of most widely used systems is Wi-Fi (IEE 802.11b) that makes use of this frequency band for short range wireless communication with throughput as high as 11 Mbps. In this work, several new ICI cancellation schemes have been tested in 2.4 GHz frequency using open source Software Defined Radio (SDR) namely GNU Radio. The GNU Radio system used in the experiment had two Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP N210) modules connected to a computer. Both the USRP units had one-daughterboard (XCVR2450) each for transmission and reception of radio signals. The input data to the USRP was prepared in compliance with IEEE-802.11b specification. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical results of the new Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) cancellation schemes. The comparison of the results revealed that the new schemes are suitable for high performance transmission. The results of this paper open up new opportunities of using OFDM in heavily congested 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (WiFi5: IEEE 802.a) for error free data transmission. The schemes also can be used in other frequencies where channels are heavily congested.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Study of OFDM ICI Cancellation Schemes in 2.4 GHz Frequency Band Using Software Defined Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Hardware","Time domain analysis","MATLAB","Binary phase shift keying","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","software radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM ICI cancellation","software defined radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","inter-carrier-interference","Wi-Fi","IEEE- 802.11","short range wireless communication","GNU Radio","USRP","data transmission","bandwidth 2.4 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Study of OFDM ICI Cancellation Schemes in 2.4 GHz Frequency Band Using Software Defined Radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302364","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Study of OFDM ICI Cancellation Schemes in 2.4 GHz Frequency Band Using Software Defined Radio","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067383S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6040061,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochun Wang","affiliation":["Communication Navigation and Command Automation Instutute of the Equipments Academy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601050900"},{"name":"Samuel Oru Besong","affiliation":["Sch. of Inf.

TR is very simple to implement, but requires an extra negligible complexity for about 1dB improvement and has to sacrifice 4% of the bandwidth as reserved tones. By combining TR with SLM, an optimal and simple PAPR reduction technique is developed to achieve more spectrum band efficiency and reduced complexity.

Subcarrier mapping (SCM) has been shown to evidently improve the average end-to-end capacity in OFDM relay networks. However perfect channel knowledge is required, which leads to large feedback amount of channel state information (CSI). In this paper, the multi-relay scenario of two-way relaying over OFDM based on sub-carrier mapping is investigated. An opportunistic relaying scheme with limit feedback CSI is proposed. The transmission scheme, which is based on instantaneous channel quality, is selected to offer maximum the system capacity. The simulations show that the proposed approach can achieve almost asymptotically performance as full CSI feedback scheme with large number of sub-carriers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040066.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying with Limit Feedback in Two-Way Relaying over OFDM with Subcarrier Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Resource management","Wireless communication","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cooperative communication","feedback","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic relaying scheme","limit feedback","two-way relaying","subcarrier mapping","network capacity","average end-to-end capacity","OFDM relay networks","perfect channel knowledge","channel state information","instantaneous channel quality","system capacity","full CSI feedback scheme","cooperative communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying with Limit Feedback in Two-Way Relaying over OFDM with Subcarrier Mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040066/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302371","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Relaying with Limit Feedback in Two-Way Relaying over OFDM with Subcarrier Mapping","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04151S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040069,"authors":[{"name":"Guangchi Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guangchi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37676623100"},{"name":"Guangping Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guangping","lastName":"Li","id":"37676167700"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37272689000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040069","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Complexity theory","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","relay control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["destination antenna selection technique","amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple-output relay system","AF MIMO relay system","matrix determinant"]}],"abstract":"The antenna selection technique balances the performance and hardware cost in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and the problems on the antenna selection in MIMO relay systems have not been fully solved.

The low complexity transmit antenna selection and user scheduling algorithms shown that the proposed algorithm obtains near optimal performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040075","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040075.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection and Receive User Scheduling for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection and Receive User Scheduling for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6040075/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302380","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040075/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection and Receive User Scheduling for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-04-007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054009S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6040076,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng Shi","affiliation":["SICE, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37711576400"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["SICE, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37897909500"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["SICE, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["SICE, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Network coding","Space time codes","Joints","Encoding","Upper bound","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","network coding","radio networks","relays","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SER performance analysis","DF wireless relay network","joint network coding scheme","distributed space-time code","decode-and-forward wireless relay network","symbol-error-rate performance analysis","upper-bound expression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040076","abstract":"In this paper, a new joint coding scheme that combine the network coding and the conditional distributed space-time codes was proposed in decode-and-forward (DF) wireless relay network.

SM can be combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to improve the reliability, quality and capacity of transmission. However, SM OFDM systems also inherit from OFDM systems the drawback of high sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO), especially in distributed MIMO environment where the CFOs of all transmit antennas are different. To overcome this problem, in this paper, the CFO characteristics of distributed SM OFDM systems are studied and a new iterative CFO compensation algorithm which exploits the interference effect caused by each antenna's CFO is proposed. Moreover, the information-conveying feature of SM system is applied to the proposed CFO compensation algorithm to reduce the computational complexity and provide fast compensation of CFOs. Simulation results show that the proposed CFO compensator achieves considerable performance improvement with low complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6040077/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302382","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative CFO Compensation Algorithm for Distributed Spatial Modulation OFDM Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative CFO Compensation Algorithm for Distributed Spatial Modulation OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-04-009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086019S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6040078,"authors":[{"name":"Mingwei Mo","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Mingwei","lastName":"Mo","id":"37887027000"},{"name":"Chun He","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"He","id":"37401894700"},{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405693500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040078","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Decoding","Detection algorithms","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","error statistics","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding algorithm","fixed complexity sphere decoder","multiple input multiple output wireless system","FSD","minimum mean square error algorithm","ordered successive interference cancellation","ZF criterion","MMSE criterion","maximum likelihood algorithm","bit error rate","MATLAB","ML BER performance","MIMO system","QPSK","QAM","computation complexity","sequential structure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040078","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Analyzation on the Performance and Complexity of Sphere Decoding Algorithms","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an improved sphere decoder (SD) and fixed-complexity sphere decoder (FSD) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems in detail.

The intention is that each group will perform cooperative transmission in the next time slot or slots. We focus on just the first hop, in which the BS chooses the group members and beamforms to them, so that their individual signal to interference and noise ratios all exceed a minimum threshold. The problem we address, therefore, is a combination of spatial multiplexing and multicasting. Our approach does zero forcing on selected nodes and then checks that an adequate number of nodes in each group have at least the minimum signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR).

Theoretical analysis and computer simulation showed the proposed algorithm could improve Symbol Error Rate performance and suppress CCI in STC-OFDM communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040082.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Analysis of Co-Channel Interference Suppression for WHT-STC-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Receiving antennas","Telecommunications","Interchannel interference","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cochannel interference","error statistics","interference suppression","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel interference suppression","OFDM systems","WHT","STC","modern communication systems","mutual interference","CCI","multi-antenna","receiver","ABF","symbol error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved Analysis of Co-Channel Interference Suppression for WHT-STC-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302387","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Analysis of Co-Channel Interference Suppression for WHT-STC-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-04-014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045623S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040084,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-fa Chu","firstName":"Hong-fa","lastName":"Chu"},{"name":"Jun Li","firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Zhi-qiang He","firstName":"Zhi-qiang","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Dan Yu","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Yu"},{"name":"Wei-ling Wu","firstName":"Wei-ling","lastName":"Wu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040084","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"abstract":"This paper gives a novel spatial and temporal Tomlinson Harashima Precoding (THP) algorithm based on concatenated processing for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) frequency selective fading channels. Generally spatial and temporal THP is jointly processed together, using joint optimization THP, and the complexity is very large. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial and temporal concatenated THP algorithm, firstly Spatial THP (S-THP) is performed to cancel spatial interference owing to different antenna or multi-user; then Temporal THP (T-THP) to each sub-channel of MIMO channel model is performed, through this step, MIMO Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) channel model is changed into flat fading MIMO channel. Using this solution, we can change the complex spatial and temporal THP into space and time domain concatenated THP, and in each space, the algorithm is relative simple. From algorithm analysis and performance comparison, we can see the validation and advantage of this method suggested in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040084.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial and Temporal Concatenated Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding under MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Fading","Joints","Channel models","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","concatenated codes","fading channels","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-temporal concatenated Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","MIMO frequency selective fading channels","multiple-input multiple-output channels","THP joint optimization","spatial interference cancellation","MIMO intersymbol interference channel model","flat fading MIMO channel","time domain concatenated THP","antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and Temporal Concatenated Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding under MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040084/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302389","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial and Temporal Concatenated Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding under MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-04-016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048073S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6040089,"authors":[{"name":"Fatang Chen","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communication, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Fatang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597484400"},{"name":"Jie You","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"You","id":"37893291500"},{"name":"Qianjun Fang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qianjun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37892956000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040089","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Digital signal processing","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Matrix decomposition","Downlink","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-out systems","Long Term Evolution","LTE-advanced systems","MMSE matrix selection algorithm","DSP","ZF algorithm","precoding matrix selection algorithm"]}],"abstract":"MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-out) has drawn most attentions during development of LTE (Long Term Evolution) and LTE-Advanced systems.

Compared with conventional MMSE matrix selection algorithm, proposed selection algorithm reduces the complexity and the amount of cycles in DSP implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding matrix selection algorithm performance is superior to conventional ZF algorithm in different channel environment.

The NFS-STBC is designed based on the combination of couples of principles, including minimal complexity, the D.N.A criterion and fast convergence, and does not require the knowledge of the channel matrix at the transmitter side.

Based on the geometrical model, a reference model and the corresponding simulation model are derived. Their statistical properties such as the three-dimensional (3D) space-time cross-correlation function (CCF), the two-dimensional (2D) spatial cross-correlation function (2D spatial CCF), and the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) are studied. For computing the parameters of the simulation model, the extended method of exact Doppler spread (MEDS) are used. The close agreement between the statistical properties of the simulation model and those of the reference model are demonstrated.

When the frequency offset was captured, the loop switched to decision direct algorithm (DDA) to decrease the phase jitter.

The complexity of the decoding algorithm is also analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040180","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040180.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Log-MAP Decoding for Turbo Product Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Log-MAP Decoding for Turbo Product Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12302480","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040180/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040180/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Log-MAP Decoding for Turbo Product Codes","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061378S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040182,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Zhang","affiliation":["National Key laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37895671500"},{"name":"Dengsheng Lin","affiliation":["National Key laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dengsheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37590231900"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040182","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Joints","Parity check codes","Turbo codes","Decoding","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","Gaussian processes","parity check codes","relays","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint soft sparse encoding scheme","three-node relay system","relayed soft information","log-likelihood-ratio","LDPC code","sparse generator matrix","Gaussian approximation","hard encoding scheme","LLR","cellular network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a joint soft sparse encoding scheme for the three-node relay system.

When singular value decomposition (SVD) based precoding is used in the system, the equivalent channel can be decomposed into several parallel non-interfering subchannels. It is showed that some of the singular values of the subchannels can be very small and the performance of the whole system is limited by the subchannels with the lower gains. Thus it is important to decide how many subchannels should be used to maximize the system performance. In this paper, we propose that half of the subchannels with higher singular values should be used, with the joint consideration of data rate and bit error rate (BER). The simulation shows that when the data rate is fixed, the proposed methods can achieve the optimal BER performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040199.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Precoding and Subchannel Selection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Relay Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6040199/","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Precoding and Subchannel Selection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Relay Systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302499","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Precoding and Subchannel Selection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Relay Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058066S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6040200,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Guo","id":"37595202300"},{"name":"Lihong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040200","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Strontium","Fading","Encoding","Signal to noise ratio","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel coding","diversity reception","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","probability","radio links","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way amplify and forward relaying performance analysis","beamforming","Nakagami-m fading channel","multiple antennas","telecommunication terminal","variable-gain relay","outage probability","unidirectional links","diversity gain","coding gain","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"The performance of a two-way relay system with beamforming is investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels.

are proposed in this paper on the condition that channel state information (CSI) is available at the destination, as well to the relays. In order to mitigate the multiple access interference (MAI) due to the usage of non-orthogonal spreading codes, we develop minimum mean square error (MMSE) or parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detectors after matched filters at relays or destination and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. We discuss four kinds of protocols in this paper, which are multiuser detectors at relays, multiuser detector at destination, multiuser detectors at both relays and destination, without relay (direct transmission). The system performance is presented through Monte-Carlo simulations which are developed for different locations of relay and different number of sources to compare these protocols. Simulation results show that the protocol with MUD at both relays and destination achieves the best performance when SNR increases. Several protocols obtain lowest BER when the relay is close to a certain location and system performance degrades when the number of sources increases.","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040211","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040211.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols Based on Decode-and-Forward Relaying and Multiuser Detection in CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040211/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols Based on Decode-and-Forward Relaying and Multiuser Detection in CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302511","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040211/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols Based on Decode-and-Forward Relaying and Multiuser Detection in CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045608S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6040216,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Li","id":"37899049300"},{"name":"Xin-min Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Huanghuai University, Zhumadian, China"],"firstName":"Xin-min","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900827200"},{"name":"Tian-lin Dong","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Huanghuai University, Zhumadian, China"],"firstName":"Tian-lin","lastName":"Dong","id":"38560221500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040216","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040216","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Rectangular waveguides","Radar antennas","Neurons","Training","Biological neural networks","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","neural nets","rectangular waveguides","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","wireless communication system","radar system","rectangular waveguide slot antenna design","ground radar equipment","airborne radars","satellite communication","space communication","Y parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rectangular waveguide","back-propagation neural network","waveguide slot antenna"]}],"doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040216","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040216.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveguide Slot Antenna Design and Optimizing That Uses a Neural Network","abstract":"Antennas are key components of wireless communication systems and radar systems.

Our research shows that SR-FQPSK inherits the desirable advantages of FQPSK, and more importantly, it yields to optimal BER performance when demodulated by a common OQPSK receiver.","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040219","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New FQPSK with Ideal BER Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040219/","displayDocTitle":"A New FQPSK with Ideal BER Performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302519","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040219/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New FQPSK with Ideal BER Performance","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-04-005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090152S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6040224,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-fa Chu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China P.R."],"firstName":"Hong-fa","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085963167"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China","School of Electronic Information and Control Engineering Shandong Polytechnic University (SPU), Jinan, China P.

Obviously, the spectrum handoff is affected by the spectrum sensing results. In this paper, a combined optimization scheme considering the interaction of spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff is proposed to improve the performance of both the functions. Specifically, the spectrum sensing performance parameters false alarm probability and missing detection probability are taken into account to reduce the negative effect (both the interference to PUs and the service block of SUs) during the spectrum handoff procedure. The interference to the PUs could be reduced obviously by adapting this scheme, associated with a potential increase of switch delay of SUs. Besides, the proposed scheme will adjust the spectrum sensing algorithm parameters to enhance the sensing performance. Numerical results demonstrate the above performance improvement by using this scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040270.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Optimization of Spectrum Handoff and Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6040270/","displayDocTitle":"Combined Optimization of Spectrum Handoff and Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302569","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Optimization of Spectrum Handoff and Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-04-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049323S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6040323,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyu Fan","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","School of Electronic Information, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Fan","id":"37891142800"},{"name":"Huifang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huifang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293466200"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139400"},{"name":"Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37402608600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040323","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":582},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Telecommunication traffic","Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Underwater acoustics","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","code division multiple access","underwater acoustic communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic wireless sensor networks","underwater acoustic channel","media access control protocol","UWASN","long propagation delay","path-oriented code assignment","POCA-CDMA- MAC protocol","round-robin method","transmitter-oriented code assignment","TOCA","ROCA","receiver-oriented code assignment"]}],"abstract":"The properties of underwater acoustic channel are quite different from those of terrestrial wireless sensor networks, which brings many challenges to design an efficient media access control (MAC) protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs). In order to overcome the long propagation delay and the funneling effect of UWASNs, a MAC protocol, named path-oriented code assignment (POCA) CDMA MAC (POCA-CDMA-MAC) protocol, is proposed in the paper. In the proposed protocol, a round-robin method and the CDMA technology are used to make the sink receive packets from multiple neighbors at the same time. Unlike other CDMA-based protocols using the transmitter-oriented code assignment (TOCA) or the receiver-oriented code assignment (ROCA), the POCA is used in the CDMA technology. Since the number of the path is much less than the number of nodes, the length of the spreading code used in systems with POCA is greatly shorter than those of the spreading code used in systems with TOCA or ROCA. Simulation results show that compared to existing MAC protocols for UWASNs, the proposed MAC protocol achieves a higher throughput, and a lower end-to-end delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved CDMA-Based MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/wicom.2011.6040323","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036127/6036637/06040323.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/wicom.2011.6040323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6040323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Improved CDMA-Based MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040323/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved CDMA-Based MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052491S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6040345,"authors":[{"name":"Lulu Liang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Interconnection Devices, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lulu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37399148900"},{"name":"Xianfeng Yang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Interconnection Devices, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xianfeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37895458400"},{"name":"Linjuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Interconnection Devices, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linjuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37858402500"},{"name":"Deyun Gao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Interconnection Devices, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37276085100"},{"name":"Hongke Zhang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Interconnection Devices, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongke","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280793000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040345","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Reliability","Event detection","Monitoring","Protocols","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event monitoring","event-driven wireless sensor networks","EWSN","event detection","reliable dissemination","false-alarm probability","high detection probability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Issues for Event Monitoring in Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks","abstract":"This paper gives out a survey on event monitoring in Event-driven wireless sensor networks (EWSNs).

At the beginning of each round, each node first checks its fuzzy module, and based on output of the fuzzy module, if the clusterhead capability exists for node, it would be ready ( in each region, number of the best nodes would be ready), then at the base station by using genetic algorithm and the location of clusterheads based on minimum energy consumed, the optimum network nodes are determined. In this study, consumption of energy for nodes which are not capable of becoming clustered is prevented and also only nodes with high capabilities in genetic algorithm take part in order to converge faster to the optimum solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040358/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12302657","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6040358/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CFGA: Clustering Wireless Sensor Network Using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFGA: Clustering Wireless Sensor Network Using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083733S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036127","isNumber":"6036637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036127","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6036637","articleId":"6040358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6040365,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecomm.

Two novel PSO algorithms namely PSO1-IR and PSO2-IR are designed for this purpose. Extensive experiments were performed on CACM and RCV1 collections. The achieved results exhibit the superiority of PSO2-IR on all the others in terms of scalability while yielding comparable quality.","doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.225","startPage":"36","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036749","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036126/6036749/06040493.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Information Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization Based Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6040493/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Web Information Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization Based Approaches","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6040493/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12302039","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Information Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization Based Approaches","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"4513a036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047928S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036126","isNumber":"6036749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036126","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6036749","articleId":"6040493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6040527,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Urban Rail Transportation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406074300"},{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898495800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6250-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6251-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6040527","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Synchronization","Generators","Decoding","Delay","Patents","EPON"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame boundary detection","fast frame synchronous structure","Ethernet Phy FEC sublayer VLSI implementation","conventional method","hardware overhead","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the 10 Gb/s Ethernet Phy Forward Error Correction (FEC) sub-layer novel VLSI structure with the following 2 ideas: one is the frame boundary detecting methodology and the other is the fast frame synchronous structure.

This technology enables inspection of the digestive system without discomfort or need for sedation, thus preventing the risks of conventional endoscopy, and has the potential of encouraging patients to undergo gastrointestinal (GI) tract examinations. However, currently available clinical products are passive devices whose locomotion is driven by natural peristalsis, with the drawback of failing to capture the images of important GI tract regions, since the doctor is unable to control the capsule's motion and orientation. To address these limitations, many research groups are working to develop active locomotion devices that allow capsule endoscopy to be performed in a totally controlled manner. This would enable the doctor to steer the capsule towards interesting pathological areas and to accomplish medical tasks. This review presents a research update on WCE and describes the state of the art of the basic modules of current swallowable devices, together with a perspective on WCE potential for screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic endoscopic procedures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2011.2171182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121958","startPage":"59","endPage":"72","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/6121958/06041014.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capsule Endoscopy: From Current Achievements to Open Challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6041014/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Capsule Endoscopy: From Current Achievements to Open Challenges","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2011","accessionNumber":"12470270","pubMedId":"22273791","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capsule Endoscopy: From Current Achievements to Open Challenges","sourcePdf":"rbme-ciuti-2171182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197541S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"6121958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"6121958","articleId":"6041014","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":6041022,"authors":[{"name":"Shaocheng Tong","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Liaoning University of Technology, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6144188/6041022/6041022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaocheng Tong received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Jinzhou Normal College, Jinzhou, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in fuzzy mathematics from Dalian Marine University, Dalian, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in fuzzy control from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1997.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Basic Mathematics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou.

Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a fuzzy filters state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states. By using the adaptive backstepping recursive design technique and constructing the dead-zone inverse, a new adaptive fuzzy backstepping output-feedback control approach is developed. It is mathematically proved that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop adaptive control system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin by appropriate choice of design parameters. The proposed approach cannot only solve the problem of the dead zones but also cancel the restrictive assumption in the previous literature that the states are all available for measurement. Two simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6144188/06041022.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2171189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2171189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Tracking Backstepping Control of Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Backstepping","Adaptive systems","Fuzzy logic","Observers","Output feedback","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","feedback","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear functions","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy output feedback tracking backstepping control approach","unknown dead zones","nonlinear strict-feedback systems","unknown functions","immeasurable state estimation","fuzzy logic systems","nonlinear functions","fuzzy filters state observer","adaptive backstepping recursive design technique","dead-zone inverse","closed-loop adaptive control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive output feedback control","backstepping design","filters state observer","fuzzy logic systems (FLSs)","nonlinear strict-feedback systems","stability analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Tracking Backstepping Control of Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6041022/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509229","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Tracking Backstepping Control of Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-tong-2171189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077628S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6144188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"351","xplore-issue":"6144188","articleId":"6041022","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6041024,"authors":[{"name":"Younghoon Cho","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6151927/6041024/6041024-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Younghoon Cho (S'10) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1980.

In the proposed current sensing method, a phase current and a branch current are simultaneously measured twice in a switching period by using a single current sensor. After that, the current reconstruction algorithm is applied to obtain the three-phase current information. Compared to previous single current sensor strategies, in the proposed method, the sensor output is regularly sampled, and the dead zone is located near the boundary of the voltage vector space instead of near the origin and the borders of each sector. This boundary-neighbored dead zone makes the proposed method more attractive in extremely low modulation index cases because it avoids periodical dead zones which have been an issue in the existing methods. Moreover, the online compensation method for a current measurement offset makes it possible to achieve purely balanced three-phase current control without an offset component. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified through simulations and experiments by measuring and reconstructing three-phase currents under various conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2171177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6151927/06041024.pdf","startPage":"2924","endPage":"2933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2171177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy With Online Current Offset Compensation Using a Single Current Sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy With Online Current Offset Compensation Using a Single Current Sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","volume":"59","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041024/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12537490","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy With Online Current Offset Compensation Using a Single Current Sensor","sourcePdf":"tie-cho-2171177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062353S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6151927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6151927","articleId":"6041024","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6041026,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxing Zhong","affiliation":["Centre for Power Electronics, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/6041026/6041026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenxing Zhong was born in China in 1984.

Relay resonators are spaced between the transmitter and receiver coils with the objectives of maximizing energy efficiency and increasing the overall transmission distance between the power source and the load. Analytical expressions for the optimal load and maximum efficiency at resonance frequency are derived. These equations are verified with practical measurements obtained from both coaxial and noncoaxial domino resonator systems. To avoid the use of high operating frequency for wireless power transfer in previous related research, the technique presented here can be used at submegahertz operation so as to minimize the power loss in both the power supply and the output stage. We demonstrated both theoretically and practically that unequal spacing for the coaxial straight domino systems has better efficiency performance than the equal-spacing method. Also, the flexibility of using resonators in various domino forms is demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06041026.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2171176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2171176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Analysis on the Use of Tesla's Resonators in Domino Forms for Wireless Power Transfer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Wireless communication","Inductance","Mathematical model","Windings","Resonant frequency","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","inductive power transmission","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tesla resonators","wireless power transfer","domino forms","relay resonators","transmitter","receiver coils","energy efficiency","transmission distance","resonance frequency","noncoaxial domino resonator systems","coaxial domino resonator systems","power loss","power supply","coaxial straight domino systems","equal-spacing method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domino resonator system","maximum efficiency operation","relay resonator","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"General Analysis on the Use of Tesla's Resonators in Domino Forms for Wireless Power Transfer","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6041026/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968354","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Analysis on the Use of Tesla's Resonators in Domino Forms for Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tie-hui-2171176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07973S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6041026","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6041028,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Lin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6180074/6041028/6041028-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Lin Zhang was born in Sichuan, China.

Even if the proposed feature is computed relying only on DC coefficient statistics, a simple threshold detector can classify NA-JPEG images with improved accuracy with respect to existing methods and on smaller image sizes, without resorting to a properly trained classifier. Moreover, the proposed scheme is able to accurately estimate the grid shift and the quantization step of the DC coefficient of the primary JPEG compression, allowing one to perform a more detailed analysis of possibly forged images.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6166811/06041029.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2170836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2170836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6166811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Nonaligned Double JPEG Compression Based on Integer Periodicity Maps","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Quantization","Forensics","Lattices","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonaligned double JPEG compression","integer periodicity maps","NA-JPEG","image compression","integer periodicity","discrete cosine transform","DCT","JPEG images","DC coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image forensics","JPEG artifacts","nonaligned double JPEG compression","threshold detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Nonaligned Double JPEG Compression Based on Integer Periodicity Maps","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6041029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578148","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Nonaligned Double JPEG Compression Based on Integer Periodicity Maps","sourcePdf":"tifs-bianchi-2170836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070202S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6166811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6166811","articleId":"6041029","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6041033,"authors":[{"name":"David He","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Modeling & Development Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6041033/6041033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David He received the B.S. degree in metallurgical engineering from the Shanghai University of Technology, Shanghai, China, the M.B.A. degree from the University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, and the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1994.","He is a Professor and Director of the Intelligent Systems Modeling & Development Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago.

The technique detects mismatches between two paths without any iteration using predefined five test vector signals. In addition, this technique corrects the path mismatches using unbalanced phase control. Therefore, the proposed scheme does not require additional amplitude mismatch control blocks such as dc/dc converters or low drop output regulators (LDO). The linearity performance of the proposed LINC system is measured with 7-MHz bandwidth orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. According to the measurement results, the proposed technique significantly enhances linearity. The measurement results also shows that the proposed LINC system satisfies the error vector magnitude (EVM) requirement for a 16-state quadratic amplitude modulation (QAM) signal (-24 dB) and a 64-QAM signal (-31 dB) up to 3.8- and 2.35-dB amplitude mismatches, respectively, with any phase mismatch.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2171062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2171062","startPage":"4184","endPage":"4193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06041038.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Amplitude and Phase Mismatches Calibration Technique for the LINC Transmitter With Unbalanced Phase Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Amplitude and Phase Mismatches Calibration Technique for the LINC Transmitter With Unbalanced Phase Control","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041038/","accessionNumber":"12408169","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041038/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Amplitude and Phase Mismatches Calibration Technique for the LINC Transmitter With Unbalanced Phase Control","sourcePdf":"tvt-hur-2171062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07564S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6041038","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6041039,"authors":[{"name":"Yogachandran Rahulamathavan","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6041039/6041039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yogachandran Rahulamathavan (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree (first-class honors) in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2008.

The conventional programming approach involves adapting the duration and magnitude of the injection pulses based on a predictive model which is estimated by using measured data. However, varying the pulse-widths or amplitudes introduces nonlinearity in the injection process which complicates the modeling, calibration and programming procedure. In this paper, we propose a linear hot-electron injection technique which significantly simplifies the programming procedure, and can achieve programming accuracy greater than 13-b which is limited by the thermal noise from the injection process. The procedure employs an active feedback circuit which ensures that all the nonlinear factors affecting the hot-electron injection process are held constant, thus achieving a stable and controllable injection rate. Measured results using an array of floating-gate voltage reference prototyped in a 0.5-\u03bcm standard CMOS process demonstrate that the injection rates can be controlled from 0.1 to 4.1 V for the programmable voltage range. Using 50-ms injection pulses, we show that the average injection rate can be adapted from 6.9 to 250 \u03bcV/cycle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12308581","htmlLink":"/document/6041041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rail-to-Rail, Linear Hot-Electron Injection Programming of Floating-Gate Voltage Bias Generators at 13-Bit Resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rail-to-Rail, Linear Hot-Electron Injection Programming of Floating-Gate Voltage Bias Generators at 13-Bit Resolution","sourcePdf":"jssc-chakrabartty-2167390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052691S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6056707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6056707","articleId":"6041041","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6041050,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jie Li (S'08) received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2003 and the M.S. degree in system engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China in 2006.

IDC's energy efficiency is gaining more attention by data center operators and electricity market operators. Effective IDC electric demand management solutions are eagerly sought by all stakeholders. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model based IDC electric demand management solution is proposed, which integrates both the impacts of locational marginal electricity prices and power management capability of IDC itself. Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling of individual server, cluster server ON/OFF scheduling, and dynamic workload dispatching are optimized while complying with all the IDC system-wide and individual heterogeneous servers' operation constraints according to the IDC applications' temporal variant workload. Reduced electricity cost can be achieved together with guaranteed QoS requirement and reliability consideration by using the proposed model. World Cup '98 data is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. According to the experimental evaluation, electricity cost could be cut by more than 20% in a peak workload period and by more than 80% in a light workload period. Besides, more than 6% electricity cost could be cut by considering the impact of electricity price difference. Experimental results also reveal that higher QoS requirement and reliability consideration could result in higher electricity cost.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2165567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2165567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","startPage":"183","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06041050.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041050","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Power demand","Electricity","Cooling","Reliability","Central Processing Unit","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","energy conservation","integer programming","Internet","load dispatching","power engineering computing","power markets","power system economics","power system management","power system reliability","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal electric demand management","Internet data center","IDC","electricity cost","energy efficiency","electricity market operator","mixed-integer programming model","locational marginal electricity price","power management capability","dynamic voltage-frequency scaling","individual server","cluster server ON-OFF scheduling","dynamic workload dispatching","QoS requirement","World Cup '98 data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic cluster server configuration","dynamic voltage/frequency scaling","electric demand management","Internet data center"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards Optimal Electric Demand Management for Internet Data Centers","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543436","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6041050/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041050/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Optimal Electric Demand Management for Internet Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tsg-li-2165567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064216S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6041050","onlineDate":"10 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6041158,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shibayama","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shibayama","id":"37284207700"},{"name":"Ryoji Ando","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoji","lastName":"Ando","id":"37587467100"},{"name":"Junji Yamauchi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37888364800"},{"name":"Hisamatsu Nakano","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisamatsu","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37277793100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-878-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-876-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3242"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3234"}],"articleNumber":"6041158","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasmons","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Optical waveguides","Waveguide discontinuities","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","optical waveguides","plasmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gap plasmonic waveguide","frequency-dependent 3D LOD-FDTD method","frequency-dependent implicit locally one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method","three-dimensional plasmonic structures","trapezoidal recursive convolution technique"]}],"abstract":"A frequency-dependent implicit locally one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (LOD-FDTD) method is developed for the analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) plasmonic structures.

However, vertical integration of layers exacerbates the reliability and thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. Liquid cooling is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3D thermal simulation model including liquid cooling, supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement liquid cooling. Our results for 3D multicore SoCs, which are based on 3D versions of UltraSPARC T1, show that thermal management approaches that combine liquid cooling with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems. Our proactive management technique provides an additional 75% average reduction in hot spots in comparison to applying only liquid cooling. Furthermore, for systems capable of varying the coolant flow rate at runtime, our feedback controller increases the improvement to 95% on average.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IFIP International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032031/6041291/06041327.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IFIP International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","doi":"10.1109/VLSISOC.2009.6041327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISOC.2009.6041327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and dynamic management of 3D multicore systems with liquid cooling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Liquid cooling","Thermal management","Microchannel","Through-silicon vias","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","feedback","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","system-on-chip","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liquid cooling","three-dimensional circuits","communication delay","vertical integration","reliability","cooling efficiency","accelerated thermal problems","multilayer architectures","3D thermal simulation model","fixed-fluid injection rates","variable-fluid injection rates","HotSpot","dynamic management policies","3D multicore SoC","UltraSPARC T1","thermal management approaches","proactive task allocation","temperature problems","proactive management technique","coolant flow rate","feedback controller","core integration","memory integration","sensor integration","RF device integration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and dynamic management of 3D multicore systems with liquid cooling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041327/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"12290349","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and dynamic management of 3D multicore systems with liquid cooling","confLoc":"Florianopolis, Brazil","sourcePdf":"pag035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080932S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"6032031","isNumber":"6041291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032031","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6041291","articleId":"6041327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6041332,"authors":[{"name":"Sheldon Logan","affiliation":["Department of CE, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheldon","lastName":"Logan","id":"37901954600"},{"name":"Matthew R.

Synthesis and simulation results demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the implemented hardware transcendental functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"12290386","htmlLink":"/document/6041365/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tradeoff of FPGA design of floating-point transcendental functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoff of FPGA design of floating-point transcendental functions","confLoc":"Florianopolis, Brazil","sourcePdf":"pag239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093103S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"6032031","isNumber":"6041291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032031","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6041291","articleId":"6041365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6041377,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Caban","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Sebastian Caban (scaban@nt.tuwien.ac.at) is a postdoc researcher at the Vienna University of Technology.

Advent of digital computers and development of data driven artificial intelligence approaches like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have helped in numerical prediction of humidity. However, very few works have been done till now in this area. The present study developed an ANN model based on the past observations of several meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, air pressure and vapour pressure as an input for training the model. The novel architecture of the proposed model contains several multilayer perceptron network (MLP) to realize better performance. The model is enriched by analysis of several alternative models like online feature selection MLP (FSMLP) and self organizing feature map MLP (SOFM-MLP). The improvement of the performance in the prediction accuracy has been demonstrated by the selection of the appropriate features. The FSMLP is used as preprocessor to select good features. The results obtained after applying the model indicate that it is well suitable for humidity as well as warm weather prediction over large geographical areas.","doi":"10.1109/ICADIWT.2011.6041395","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies (ICADIWT 2011)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICADIWT.2011.6041395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041393","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies (ICADIWT 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032142/6041393/06041395.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Better prediction of humidity using Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041395/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Better prediction of humidity using Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041395/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12290578","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Better prediction of humidity using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Stevens Point, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056145S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032142","isNumber":"6041393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032142","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6041393","articleId":"6041395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6041403,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Lv","affiliation":["Teaching and Research Section of Computer, Artillery Academy, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189200"},{"name":"Weimin He","affiliation":["Department of Computing and New Media Technologies, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Stevens Point, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"He","id":"37532766800"},{"name":"Ping Yan","affiliation":["School of Science, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Yan","id":"37286117900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9825-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9824-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9823-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6041403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","delays","diffusion","Lyapunov methods","mathematical analysis","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential synchronization","Cohen-Grossberg neural network","Lyapunov functional method","Sobolev inequality","drive-response cellular neural network","diffusion term"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["exponential synchronization","Cohen-Grossberg neural networks","Lyapunov functional","diffusion terms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041403","abstract":"In this paper, the exponential synchronization of a class of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with delays and diffusion terms is discussed.

A sinusoidal reference signal and two triangular carrier signals in phase and of the same frequency but different offset voltages were used to generate the PWM signals for the inverter switches. Besides Altera Quartus II software, Matlab/Simulink software was used to simulate and verify the proposed circuit before it was implemented in a prototype hardware. Simulation and experiment results closely agreed.","doi":"10.1109/CET.2011.6041436","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Clean Energy and Technology (CET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Clean Energy and Technology (CET)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032030/6041433/06041436.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CET.2011.6041436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based pulse-width modulation control for single-phase multilevel inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041436/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based pulse-width modulation control for single-phase multilevel inverter","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041436/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12304848","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based pulse-width modulation control for single-phase multilevel inverter","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"12FPGABasedPulseWidthModulationControlforSinglePha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060063S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032030","isNumber":"6041433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032030","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6041433","articleId":"6041436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6041529,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic DiTomaso","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"DiTomaso","id":"37888186700"},{"name":"Avinash Kodi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Avinash","lastName":"Kodi","id":"37271805600"},{"name":"Savas Kaya","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Savas","lastName":"Kaya","id":"37270426400"},{"name":"David Matolak","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Matolak","id":"37270693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1563-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4537-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4794"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5569"}],"articleNumber":"6041529","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":595},"abstract":"Network-on-Chips (NoCs) paradigm is fast becoming a defacto standard for designing communication infrastructure for multicores with the dual goals of reducing power consumption while improving performance. However, research has shown that power consumption and wiring complexity will be two of the major constraints that will hinder the growth of future NoCs architecture. This has resulted in the investigation of emerging technologies and devices to alleviate the power and performance bottleneck in NoCs. In this paper, we propose iWISE, an inter-router wireless scalable express channels for NoCs architecture that minimizes the power consumption via hybrid wireless communication channels, reduces the area overhead with smaller routers and shared buffers, and improves performance by minimizing the hop count. We compared our network to leading electrical and wireless topologies such as mesh, concentrated mesh, flattened butterfly and other wireless hybrid topologies. Our simulation results on real applications such as Splash-2, PARSEC, and SPEC2006 for 64 core architectures indicate that we save 2X power and 2X area while improving performance significantly. We show that iWISE can be further scaled to 256 cores while achieving a 2.5X performance increase and saving of 2X power when compared to other wireless networks on synthetic workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041101/6041513/06041529.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2011.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2011.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iWISE: Inter-router Wireless Scalable Express Channels for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Transceivers","Wires","Bandwidth","Antennas","Wireless sensor networks","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iWISE","interrouter wireless scalable express channels","network-on-chip architecture","NoC architecture","communication infrastructure","power consumption","wiring complexity","hybrid wireless communication channels","wireless topology","electrical topology","Splash-2","PARSEC","SPEC2006","wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["On-chip Interconnects","Wireless Technology","Chip Multiprocessors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"iWISE: Inter-router Wireless Scalable Express Channels for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306797","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iWISE: Inter-router Wireless Scalable Express Channels for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) Architecture","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4537a011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060588S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041101","isNumber":"6041513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041101","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6041513","articleId":"6041529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6041623,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Chernyak","affiliation":["Moscow Aviation Institute, State Technical University, Russia"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Chernyak","id":"37360060700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-927535-28-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0138-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-927535-29-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"6041623","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Radar antennas","Joints","Fluctuations","Gain","Radar measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar tracking","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radars","multisite radar systems","multisite multistatic radar systems","MSRS","search mode","tracking mode"]}],"abstract":"The theoretical issues of using MIMO radars in multisite (multistatic) radar systems (MSRSs) are considered.

Also, weighted least square estimation is used for harmonic state estimation, which is based on singular value decomposition rather than the normal equations. The singular value decomposition approach eliminates the need of observability analysis prior to estimation. Optimal number and position of phasor measurement units among three different cases for harmonic state estimation in unbalanced distribution systems are compared. In first case, it is assumed that phasor measurement unit has enough channels to measure bus voltage phasor and all current phasors connected to this bus. In two other cases, phasor measurement unit has only single channel to measure a three-phase current. In one case, phasor measurement unit measured a current phasors along one branch that is connected to the bus, and in another case, phasor measurement unit measures three single phase current phasors along 1, 2 or 3 branches that are connected to the bus. The proposed algorithms for harmonic state estimation and optimal measurement placement are applied on a real 58-bus unbalanced distribution system and the results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICSEng.2011.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041390/6041554/06041804.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Systems Engineering","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEng.2011.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Placement of Phasor Measurement Units for Harmonic State Estimation in Unbalanced Distribution System Using Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Placement of Phasor Measurement Units for Harmonic State Estimation in Unbalanced Distribution System Using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12306941","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6041804/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Placement of Phasor Measurement Units for Harmonic State Estimation in Unbalanced Distribution System Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"4495a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068064S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041390","isNumber":"6041554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041390","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6041554","articleId":"6041804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6041814,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Abbasi Nozari","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Faculty of Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hasan Abbasi","lastName":"Nozari","id":"37889598900"},{"name":"Hamed Dehghan Banadaki","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Faculty of Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed Dehghan","lastName":"Banadaki","id":"37889035900"},{"name":"Mehdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli","affiliation":["Department of control, K.N.

Consequently, the inflicted interference power of the secondary transmitters on the primary receivers should be less than certain threshold levels that is required to be considered in designing power control algorithms for such networks. In this paper, we first propose a power reduction algorithm for the set of secondary transmitting links in order to guarantee that the members of this set do not violate the interference constraints set by primary users while maintaining their specific SINR quality of service requirements. In addition, in scenarios where it is not possible to meet the constraints while all transmitters are active, a distributed stochastic elimination algorithm is proposed that turns off transmission of a selected number of links. The main advantage of the proposed elimination algorithm is that it can be used in a distributed manner resulting in a more practical solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12306953","htmlLink":"/document/6041816/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel Power Control Algorithms for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Power Control Algorithms for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"4495a206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074873S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041390","isNumber":"6041554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041390","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6041554","articleId":"6041816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6041849,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Shehata","affiliation":["Engineering College, Arab Academy for Science & Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Shehata","id":"37284113200"},{"name":"Atalla Hashad","affiliation":["Engineering College, Arab Academy for Science & Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Atalla","lastName":"Hashad","id":"37284114000"},{"name":"Hanady Husien","affiliation":["Engineering College, Arab Academy for Science & Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hanady","lastName":"Husien","id":"37888974400"},{"name":"Hany Fahmy","affiliation":["Engineering College, Arab Academy for Science & Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Fahmy","id":"37889633700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1078-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6041849","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Video Compression Technique for High Definition Videos Implemented on a FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Random access memory","Discrete wavelet transforms","High definition video","Field programmable gate arrays","Motion estimation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video compression technique","high definition videos","FPGA","motion vector technique","matching block","gray scale","Xilinx Vertex 2 2V250fg456"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video compression","FPGA","High Definition video","Binary motion Estimation"]}],"abstract":"High definition videos contain huge data to be transmitted and received, which is difficult to be sent and stored.

In many cases, not all the tests contribute towards effective diagnosis of a disease. Our work is to classify the presence of heart disease with reduced number of attributes. Original, 13 attributes are involved in classify the heart disease. We use Information Gain to determine the attributes which reduces the number of attributes which is need to be taken from patients.

To provide cloud computing services, it is required to allocate bandwidth to access the processing ability simultaneously. It would be also necessary in the future to consider the case where ICT equipment operates under the condition that the total electric power supply available is restricted, because the percentage of electric power generated by renewable energy, such as photovoltaic power generation and wind power energy, will continue to rise and the power generated by these natural means varies over time considerably. First, this paper presents cloud resource allocation guidelines in the case where there is a limit to electric power capacity available in each area, assuming a cloud computing environment in which both processing ability and network bandwidth are allocated simultaneously. Next, it proposes a method for optimally allocating both processing ability and bandwidth as well as electric power capacity. Optimal allocation means that the number of requests that can be processed is maximized, and the power consumed by a request is minimized. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposed method is effective. Finally, this paper presents an algorithm that attempts to reduce total electric power consumption by aggregating request processing of multiple areas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Optimal Resource Allocation Method for Cloud Computing Environments with Limited Electric Power Capacity","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2011.11","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041102/6041570/06041899.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2011.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Optimal Resource Allocation Method for Cloud Computing Environments with Limited Electric Power Capacity","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6041899/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306833","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Optimal Resource Allocation Method for Cloud Computing Environments with Limited Electric Power Capacity","confLoc":"Tirana, Albania","sourcePdf":"4458a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066141S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041102","isNumber":"6041570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041102","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6041570","articleId":"6041899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6041904,"authors":[{"name":"Admir Barolli","affiliation":["Department of Computers and Information Science, Seikei University, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Admir","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37590382400"},{"name":"Evjola Spaho","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Evjola","lastName":"Spaho","id":"37593782400"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"},{"name":"Leonard Barolli","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37267114100"},{"name":"Makoto Takizawa","affiliation":["Department of Computers and Information Science, Seikei University, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37279376800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0789-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4458-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0418"}],"articleNumber":"6041904","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041904","abstract":"Much work has been done on routing in Ad-hoc networks, but the proposed routing solutions only deal with the best effort data traffic. Connections with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as voice channels with delay and bandwidth constraints, are not supported. The QoS routing has been receiving increasingly intensive attention, but searching for the shortest path with many metrics is an NP-complete problem. For this reason, approximated solutions and heuristic algorithms should be developed for multi-path constraints QoS routing. Also, the routing methods should be adaptive, flexible, and intelligent. In this paper, we use Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Multi-objective Optimization for QoS routing in Ad-hoc Networks. In order to reduce the search space of GA, we implemented a Search Space Reduction Algorithm (SSRA). After the reduction of search space the GAMAN search time improves.

Such problematic is encountered in the context of parallel computing when dealing with conditional precedence constrained parallel tasks on a multi-core machine. The conditional task graph was introduced in order to express conditional precedence constraints and thus to model conditional execution in an application, which is not possible with a conventional task graph. We focus here in the calculation of two probabilistic parameters: the heads (release dates) and the tails (delivery times). An algorithm for computing these parameters is proposed. Although it has a pseudo-polynomial time complexity, the execution time of the algorithm can be further reduced at the price of less precision in the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6041942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6041942/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12306876","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Parameters of Conditional Task Graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Parameters of Conditional Task Graphs","confLoc":"Tirana, Albania","sourcePdf":"4458a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074685S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041102","isNumber":"6041570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041102","xplore-issue":"6041570","articleId":"6041942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6041953,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Oh Park","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Oh","lastName":"Park","id":"37311167600"},{"name":"Sung Jo Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Jo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309968600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0789-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4458-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0418"}],"articleNumber":"6041953","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6041953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","File systems","Flash memory","Arrays","Indexes","Hard disks","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","disc drives","flash memories","hard discs","Linux","NAND circuits","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array file system","multiple small-capacity NAND flash memory","NAND flash memory file systems","multiple NAND flash memory","large-capacity storage","NAFS","cache policy","mount scheme","read and write performance","mount time","conventional NAND file systems","YAFFS2","JFFS2","disk-based file system","Linux","HDD-RAID5-EXT3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash memory","File System","Large-Capacity Storage","Mount","Garbage Collection","Cache"]}],"abstract":"The existing NAND flash memory file systems have not taken into account multiple NAND flash memories for large-capacity storage.

This will be done by studying the jitter influence on the complex ambiguity function (CAF) of GSM signal. The performance of the system depends crucially on the clutter cancellation performance as has been demonstrated in [1]. Moreover it has been shown that the exact reconstruction of the reference signal is a key factor for eliminating the clutter as good as possible. In reality and due to the influence of the oscillator jitter in the analog-to-digital converter the reproduction of an identical reference signal is merely impossible. Thus the synthesized (clean) version of the reference is not coherent with the measured data and may not give satisfying results. This investigation gives bounds on requirements to the oscillator such that the incoherence between the synthesized and the measured reference signal becomes acceptable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time jitter influence on GSM passive radar","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032140/6041611/06042150.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Time jitter influence on GSM passive radar","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042150/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305121","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time jitter influence on GSM passive radar","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"153ZemmariPID1929127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043306S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032140","isNumber":"6041611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6041611","articleId":"6042150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"DGON","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6042163,"authors":[{"name":"Jingying Bi","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jingying","lastName":"Bi","id":"37891384000"},{"name":"Hermann Rohling","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Rohling","id":"37270368300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-927535-28-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0138-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-927535-29-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"6042163","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042163","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Binary codes","Receivers","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","filtering theory","interference (signal)","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched filter","complementary code design","zero range sidelobe property","radar applications","stationary range sidelobe interferences","binary phase codeword pairs"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041611","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatched filter applied to complementary code design","startPage":"559","endPage":"564","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032140/6041611/06042163.pdf","abstract":"Complementary code pairs have zero range sidelobe property, which is useful in radar applications to avoid stationary range sidelobe interferences.

This paper presents a pulse precoding scheme for MIMO radars where two pulses are jointly linearly coded across two transmitters to increase the overall system performance. The algorithm is specifically designed to link the gap between these two extreme cases of emitting a single pulse or two coded pulse in a smooth manner while ensuring that the number of waveforms in use is kept constant. The coding strategy makes use of statistical radar information emphasizing line-of-sight (LOS) reflectivity levels which introduce limited beamforming gain to the system. Simulations are used to demonstrate that the use of statistical information and pulse precoding can be beneficial even for widely separated antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032140/6041611/06042183.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"708","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear bi-pulse precoding for MIMO radar transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","MIMO radar","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","linear codes","MIMO radar","precoding","radar antennas","radar receivers","radar signal processing","radar transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear bi-pulse precoding","MIMO radar transmitter","MIMO radar system","radar receiver","orthogonal pulse","transmitting antenna","two coded pulse","coding strategy","statistical radar information","line-of-sight","LOS reflectivity level","beamforming gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Linear bi-pulse precoding for MIMO radar transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305154","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear bi-pulse precoding for MIMO radar transmitters","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"293AkhtarPID1878767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03556S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032140","isNumber":"6041611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032140","xplore-issue":"6041611","articleId":"6042183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"DGON","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6042185,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Lesturgie","affiliation":["SUPELEC-E3S / SONDRA, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France","ONERA, the French AeroSpace Institute, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Lesturgie","id":"37299279100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-927535-28-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0138-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-927535-29-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"6042185","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":534},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Arrays","Radar","Diversity reception","Clutter","Antenna arrays","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground penetrating radar","MIMO radar","orthogonal codes","radar detection","radar tracking","search radar","space-time adaptive processing","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","multiple input multiple output concept","space time adaptive processing","STAP","ground moving target detection","high frequency surface waves radar","HFSWR","maritime surveillance","orthogonal coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","HFSWR","STAP","RIAS"]}],"abstract":"After a brief introduction of existing MIMO systems, this paper attempts to define the basic properties of a MIMO - Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs concept.

In this paper, we proposed a new localization model for MIMO radar system, which make hyperbolic location method can be extended to MIMO radar. TOAs equations are build from multipath between transmitters and receivers to estimate the target position. The equations are redundant since number of paths is more than number of target coordinates. Our new model makes full use of redundant paths to decrease the impact of TOA measurement errors and improve estimation accuracy. Then, we proposed a two-steps method to solve the overdetermined and nonlinear TOAs equations. Different with conventional Taylor expansion method, which needs an initial position closed to the target and iterative process is necessary, we calculate the initial position in first step and use partly Taylor expansion and BLUE algorithm in the second step to obtain accurate results. GDOP performance of the new method is analyzed. CRLB of the proposed algorithm is derived as well and localization error of new algorithm is almost equal to CRLB which prove the value of the new method.","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032140/6041611/06042212.pdf","startPage":"880","endPage":"885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperbolic localization method for MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042212/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperbolic localization method for MIMO radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042212/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperbolic localization method for MIMO radar","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"410HongWangPID1793605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061453S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032140","isNumber":"6041611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6041611","articleId":"6042212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"DGON","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042272,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-7050-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6042272","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4741},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Industrial & Commercial Power Systems Standards Development Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society"}],"abstract":"The problems of system grounding, that is, connection to ground of neutral, of the corner of the delta, or of the midtap of one phase, are covered.

Connecting the frames and enclosures of electric apparatus, such as motors, switchgear, transformers, buses, cables, conduits, building frames, and portable equipment, to a ground system is addressed. The fundamentals of making the interconnection of a ground conductor system between electric equipment and the ground rods, water pipes, etc., are outlined. The problems of static electricity- how it is generated, what processes may produce it, how it is measured, and what should be done to prevent its generation or to drain the static charges to earth to prevent sparking-are treated. Methods of protecting structures against the effects of lightning are also covered. Obtaining a low-resistance connection to earth, use of ground rods, connections to water pipes, etc., are discussed.

A new ensemble of codes, termed multi-edge-type bilayer expurgated LDPC (MET-BE-LDPC) codes, is introduced where the BE-LDPC code design problem is transformed into the problem of optimizing the multinomials of a multi-edge-type LDPC code. We propose two design strategies for optimizing MET-BE-LDPC codes; the bilayer approach is preferred when the difference in SNR between the source-to-relay and the source to-destination channels is small, while the bilayer approach with intermediate rates is preferred when this difference is large. In both proposed design strategies multi-edge-type density evolution is used for code optimization. The resulting MET-BE-LDPC codes exhibit improved threshold and bit-error-rate performance as compared to previously reported bilayer LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06042298.pdf","startPage":"2993","endPage":"3006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Multi-Edge-Type Bilayer-Expurgated LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward in Relay Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design of Multi-Edge-Type Bilayer-Expurgated LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward in Relay Channels","volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388291","htmlLink":"/document/6042298/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Multi-Edge-Type Bilayer-Expurgated LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward in Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"2993-tc1111-azmi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153634S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6042298","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042299,"authors":[{"name":"Redha M.

The impact of imperfect channel estimation and the effect of phase and time misalignments between desired and undesired signals are implicitly investigated. It is assumed that the desired signal replicas and interfering signals undergo statistically independent flat Rayleigh fading. The analysis is applicable for arbitrary transmit antenna selection, based either on receive combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or receive combined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). For the scenario of identical multiple-antenna channels, closed-form analytical results for the combined SNR statistics and some performance measures are first presented. The SNR-based and SINR-based selection algorithms are then employed to obtain expressions for the distribution of combined SINR and outage probability performance, which are applicable for different statistical models of interfering signals. The adopted system models herein as well as the analytical development add enhancements on many existing results, and can be used to study the performance of different architectures under various channel conditions when the implementation complexity is of interest.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06042299.pdf","startPage":"3177","endPage":"3191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Arbitrary Transmit Selection for Threshold-Based Receive MRC with and without Co-Channel Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Fading channels","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","cochannel interference","diversity reception","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels","signal processing","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary transmit selection performance","threshold-based receive MRC","cochannel interference","multiple-antenna diversity system performance","signal replicas","threshold-based maximal ratio combining","receiver","transmitter","signal strength","imperfect channel estimation","phase misalignments","time misalignments","statistically independent flat Rayleigh fading","transmit antenna selection","SNR","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","identical multiple-antenna channel","combined SNR statistics","SNR-based selection algorithm","SINR-based selection algorithm","outage probability","statistical model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arbitrary transmit selection","threshold-based receive MRC","multiple-antenna systems","imperfect channel estimation","co-channel interference","performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Arbitrary Transmit Selection for Threshold-Based Receive MRC with and without Co-Channel Interference","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6042299/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388292","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Arbitrary Transmit Selection for Threshold-Based Receive MRC with and without Co-Channel Interference","sourcePdf":"3177-tc1111-raday.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121226S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6042299","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6042301,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey G.

These models have been used extensively but suffer from being both highly idealized and not very tractable, so complex system-level simulations are used to evaluate coverage/outage probability and rate. More tractable models have long been desirable. We develop new general models for the multi-cell signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using stochastic geometry. Under very general assumptions, the resulting expressions for the downlink SINR CCDF (equivalent to the coverage probability) involve quickly computable integrals, and in some practical special cases can be simplified to common integrals (e.g., the Q-function) or even to simple closed-form expressions. We also derive the mean rate, and then the coverage gain (and mean rate loss) from static frequency reuse. We compare our coverage predictions to the grid model and an actual base station deployment, and observe that the proposed model is pessimistic (a lower bound on coverage) whereas the grid model is optimistic, and that both are about equally accurate. In addition to being more tractable, the proposed model may better capture the increasingly opportunistic and dense placement of base stations in future networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06042301.pdf","startPage":"3122","endPage":"3134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tractable Approach to Coverage and Rate in Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Tractable Approach to Coverage and Rate in Cellular Networks","volume":"59","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042301/","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388293","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042301/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tractable Approach to Coverage and Rate in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"3122-tc1111-andrews.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076855S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2108","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6042301","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6042302,"authors":[{"name":"Jane Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6110251/6042302/6042302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jane Wei Huang (S'07) received her bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University, China in 2005, and M.Phil.

By incorporating cognitive capabilities into femtocell base stations, the Home evolved Node Bs (HeNBs) can be formulated as secondary base stations seeking to maximize the spectrum utility while minimizing interference to primary base stations (evolved Node-Bs). The competition amongst cognitive HeNBs for spectrum resources is formulated as a non-cooperative game-theoretic learning problem where each agent (HeNB) seeks to adapt its strategy in real time. We formulate the resource block (RB) allocation among HeNBs in the downlink of a LTE system using a game-theoretic framework, where the correlated equilibrium solutions of the formulated game are being investigated.

The proposed detector relies on a modified Matched Filter (MF) concept. More specifically, we exploit both the constellation diagram of the modulation scheme employed as well as the Inter-Element-Interference (IEI)-free STSK architecture. Furthermore, we generalize the Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)- or PSK-aided Differentially-encoded STSK (DSTSK) concept and conceive its more bandwidth-efficient QAM-aided counterpart. Then, the proposed reduced-complexity CSTSK detector is applied to the QAM-aided DSTSK scheme, which enables us to carry out low-complexity non-coherent detection, while dispensing with channel estimation. It is revealed that the proposed detector is capable of approaching the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector's performance, while avoiding the exhaustive ML search. Interestingly, our simulation results also demonstrate that the reduced-complexity detector advocated may achieve the same performance as that of the optimal ML detector for the specific STSK scheme's parameters. Another novelty of this paper is that the star-QAM STSK scheme tends to outperform its square-QAM counterpart, especially for high number of dispersion matrices. Furthermore, we provided both the theoretical analysis and the simulations, in order to support this unexpected fact.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.110154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.110154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06042304.pdf","startPage":"3090","endPage":"3101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Coherent Versus Non-Coherent QAM-Aided Space-Time Shift Keying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Coherent Versus Non-Coherent QAM-Aided Space-Time Shift Keying","volume":"59","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042304/","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388294","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042304/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Coherent Versus Non-Coherent QAM-Aided Space-Time Shift Keying","sourcePdf":"3090-tc1111-sugiura.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131764S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6042304","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6042306,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6042306/6042306-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongzheng Wang received a B.S. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China in 2002, a M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2005, and a Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong in 2010, all in electrical engineering.

The locations of the relays are essentially random due to their unpredictable mobility and are thus assumed to form a spatial Poisson process. A general analytical approach to performance analysis is developed to accommodate the randomness of the locations as well as the underlying channels. The outage probability of the system is derived based on the theory of point processes. In particular, two relay selection criteria, namely the best forward channel selection and the best worse channel selection, are used as examples to illustrate the proposed approach. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte-Carlo simulations with various system configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Analytical Approach for Opportunistic Cooperative Systems with Spatially Random Relays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101386","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06042306.pdf","startPage":"4122","endPage":"4129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"A General Analytical Approach for Opportunistic Cooperative Systems with Spatially Random Relays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6042306/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425529","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Analytical Approach for Opportunistic Cooperative Systems with Spatially Random Relays","sourcePdf":"4122-tw1112-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055209S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6042306","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042307,"authors":[{"name":"Geyong Min","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Bradford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6042307/6042307-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Geyong Min is a Reader in Computer Networking in the Department of Computing at the University of Bradford, UK.

Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) is a promising MAC protocol extension for provisioning of differentiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) in multimedia WLANs. However, for analytical tractability and simplicity, most existing performance models of TXOP have been restricted to unrealistic working scenarios where the traffic is saturated or follows a Poisson process, which is unable to capture the heterogeneous characteristics of multimedia traffic. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an original analytical model for TXOP in WLANs with heterogeneous stations in the presence of multimedia applications. Specifically, the traffic generated by heterogeneous stations with background, voice and video applications is modelled by the non-bursty Poisson, bursty Markov-Modulated Poisson Process, and fractal self-similar process, respectively. QoS measures including throughput, end-to-end delay, and frame loss probability are derived. The extensive comparison between the analytical results and those obtained from simulation experiments subject to the traffic parameters of real-world voice and video sources validates the accuracy of the developed model for WLANs with practical multimedia applications. The performance results reveal the importance of taking into account the heterogeneous stations for the accurate evaluation of TXOP in wireless multimedia networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101387","endPage":"4139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06042307.pdf","startPage":"4130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Modelling and Analysis of the TXOP Scheme in Wireless Multimedia Networks with Heterogeneous Stations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042307/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Modelling and Analysis of the TXOP Scheme in Wireless Multimedia Networks with Heterogeneous Stations","volume":"10","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"12425530","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6042307/","publicationDate":"December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Modelling and Analysis of the TXOP Scheme in Wireless Multimedia Networks with Heterogeneous Stations","sourcePdf":"4130-tw1112-min.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115347S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6042307","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6042310,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Boostanimehr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6042310/6042310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamidreza Boostanimehr (S'08) received the Bachelors degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008, and the M.

The relay forwards the message received from the source on a subset of available subcarriers in the second time slot. Firstly, a subcarrier pairing and selection algorithm is proposed, assuming that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at all nodes, then, power is allocated to both the source and relay stations under individual power constraints in order to maximize the capacity. Secondly, subcarrier selection and pairing, and power allocation (PA) under partial CSI assumption along with individual power constraints are addressed. The result is a novel distributed algorithm with low complexity maximizing the expected value of capacity at the source and relay nodes. Finally, the simulation results show that selective relaying combined with subcarrier pairing and PA improves the system capacity to a considerable extent in both perfect and partial CSI cases.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.092911.101200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06042310.pdf","startPage":"4057","endPage":"4067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.092911.101200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation for DF OFDM Relay Systems with Perfect and Partial CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042310/","displayDocTitle":"Selective Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation for DF OFDM Relay Systems with Perfect and Partial CSI","volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425532","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042310/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation for DF OFDM Relay Systems with Perfect and Partial CSI","sourcePdf":"4057-tw1112-boost.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074986S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6042310","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042311,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna P.

Here we derive distributions and moments for changes in the link gain and maximum eigenvalue and autocorrelation functions for the link gain and maximum eigenvalue as well as simple approximate results for the ordered eigenvalue differences. We then consider variations in performance via the level crossing rates (LCRs) of the bit error rates (BERs) across the frequency bins of the MIMO OFDM system operating over a Rayleigh fading channel. Each eigenmode constitutes a random process in the frequency domain and we compute the LCR for the BER of transmission down the eigenchannels of the MIMO OFDM channel.

Our contributions are summarized as follows. For linear arrays with constrained form factor, an asymptotic analysis based on the properties of prolate spheroidal wave functions shows that a sparse array producing a spatially uncorrelated channel matrix effectively provides the maximum number of spatial degrees of freedom in a LOS environment, although substantial beamforming gains can be obtained by using denser arrays. This motivates our proposed mm-wave MIMO architecture, which utilizes arrays of subarrays to provide both directivity and spatial multiplexing gains. System performance is evaluated in a simulated indoor environment using a ray-tracing model that incorporates multipath effects and potential LOS blockage. Eigenmode transmission with waterfilling power allocation serves as a performance benchmark, and is compared to the simpler scheme of beamsteering transmission with MMSE reception and a fixed signal constellation. Our numerical results provide insight into the spatial variations of attainable capacity within a room, and the combinations of beamsteering and spatial multiplexing used in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.092911.101843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.092911.101843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06042312.pdf","startPage":"4150","endPage":"4160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Millimeter Wave MIMO: Feasibility and Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Millimeter Wave MIMO: Feasibility and Performance","volume":"10","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042312/","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425533","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042312/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Millimeter Wave MIMO: Feasibility and Performance","sourcePdf":"4150-tw1112-tork.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076444S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6042312","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6042313,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6042313/6042313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gan Zheng received the B.

Our aim is to maximize the sum-rate subject to individual and total power constraints on the relays and a relay assignment constraint. In the case of fixed relay selection, the power allocation optimization is convex and an efficient recursive algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimum. The joint optimization of relay selection and power allocation, however, appears to be non-convex and is not known to be tractable. To tackle this, we propose a novel algorithm using Markov chain Monte-Carlo with Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization (MCMC-KLDM), which is proved to converge to the global optimum almost surely. Results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms a greedy approach and achieves near-optimal performance at very low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06042313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.093011.101685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","startPage":"4091","endPage":"4099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach for Joint Relay Assignment and Power Allocation in Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach for Joint Relay Assignment and Power Allocation in Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425534","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6042313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach for Joint Relay Assignment and Power Allocation in Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"4091-tw1112-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064448S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6042313","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042314,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris E.

The major limiting factors of the capacity are the propagation phenomena (rain attenuation for frequencies above 10GHz) and intercell interference. Several power control schemes have been proposed to mitigate these factors and decrease the outage time. In this Letter we propose a new Climate-Driven Fuzzy Inference System for downlink power control with engineering inputs such as the rain induced attenuation on the wanted and the interfering links, the deterministic path loss and the clear-sky carrier-to-interference ratio. The proposed FIS scheme has different parameters based on the statistics of rain rate and is more energy efficient.

If these quantities can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, they can be used in global and local control methods. In the classic state estimation methods, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique, the linear approximations of the system at a given moment in time may introduce errors in the states. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the EKF, the authors of this paper have applied the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimating and predicting the states of a synchronous machine, including rotor angle and rotor speed, using phasor measurement unit (PMU) quantities. The UKF algorithm propagates the pdf of a random variable in a simple and effective way and is accurate up to the second order in estimating the mean and covariance. The overall impression is that the performance of the UKF is better than the EKF in terms of robustness, speed of convergence, and also different levels of noise. Simulation results including saturation effects and grid faults show the accuracy and efficiency of the UKF method in state estimation of the system, especially at higher noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2011.2168225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2011.2168225","startPage":"1099","endPage":"1108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/6083464/06042326.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online State Estimation of a Synchronous Generator Using Unscented Kalman Filter From Phasor Measurements Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Online State Estimation of a Synchronous Generator Using Unscented Kalman Filter From Phasor Measurements Units","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12376690","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042326/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online State Estimation of a Synchronous Generator Using Unscented Kalman Filter From Phasor Measurements Units","sourcePdf":"tec-ghahremani-2168225-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045516S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6083464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"172","articleId":"6042326","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":6042331,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Parasiliti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/6042331/6042331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Parasiliti was born in Tortorici, Italy, in 1956.

quality in positron emission tomography (PET). In order to minimize its effects, the use of respiratory synchronized acquisitions, leading to gated frames, has been suggested. Such frames, however, are of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as they contain reduced statistics. Super-resolution (SR) techniques make use of the motion in a sequence of images in order to improve their quality. They aim at enhancing a low-resolution image belonging to a sequence of images representing different views of the same scene. In this work, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) super-resolution algorithm has been implemented and applied to respiratory gated PET images for motion compensation. An edge preserving Huber regularization term was used to ensure convergence. Motion fields were recovered using a B-spline based elastic registration algorithm. The performance of the SR algorithm was evaluated through the use of both simulated and clinical datasets by assessing image SNR, as well as the contrast, position and extent of the different lesions. Results were compared to summing the registered synchronized frames on both simulated and clinical datasets. The super-resolution image had higher SNR (by a factor of over 4 on average) and lesion contrast (by a factor of 2) than the single respiratory synchronized frame using the same reconstruction matrix size. In comparison to the motion corrected or the motion free images a similar SNR was obtained, while improvements of up to 20% in the recovered lesion size and contrast were measured. Finally, the recovered lesion locations on the SR images were systematically closer to the true simulated lesion positions. These observations concerning the SNR, lesion contrast and size were confirmed on two clinical datasets included in the study. In conclusion, the use of SR techniques applied to respiratory motion synchronized images lead to motion compensation combined with improved image SNR and contrast, without any increase in the overall acquisition times.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6042337/","accessionNumber":"12508940","pubMedId":"21997249","displayDocTitle":"Super-Resolution in Respiratory Synchronized Positron Emission Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Resolution in Respiratory Synchronized Positron Emission Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmi-wallach-2171358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111243S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6142636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6142636","articleId":"6042337","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6042338,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6130620/6042338/6042338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Chun Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in information engineering from I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2007.

The state-based bimodal alignment strategy in SC-HMM is proposed to align the temporal relation between audio and visual streams. The Bayesian classifier weighting scheme is then adopted to explore the contributions of the SC-HMM-based classifiers for different audio-visual feature pairs in order to obtain the emotion recognition output.

In the design of the controller, only available input-output data is required instead of known system dynamics. A data-driven model is established by a recurrent neural network (NN) to reconstruct the unknown system dynamics using available input-output data. By adding a novel adjustable term related to the modeling error, the resultant modeling error is first guaranteed to converge to zero. Then, based on the obtained data-driven model, the ADP method is utilized to design the approximate optimal tracking controller, which consists of the steady-state controller and the optimal feedback controller. Further, a robustifying term is developed to compensate for the NN approximation errors introduced by implementing the ADP method. Based on Lyapunov approach, stability analysis of the closed-loop system is performed to show that the proposed controller guarantees the system state asymptotically tracking the desired trajectory. Additionally, the obtained control input is proven to be close to the optimal control input within a small bound. Finally, two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2168538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099846/06042339.pdf","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2168538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Robust Approximate Optimal Tracking Control for Unknown General Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Robust Approximate Optimal Tracking Control for Unknown General Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042339/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12409259","pubMedId":"21997259","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042339/","volume":"22","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Robust Approximate Optimal Tracking Control for Unknown General Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming Method","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhang-pt2-2168538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136228S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"380","xplore-issue":"6099846","articleId":"6042339","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6042342,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6042342/6042342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Yu (S\u201911) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include switching-mode system modeling and class-D amplifier design."]},"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085382791"},{"name":"Meng Tong Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6042342/6042342-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Meng Tong Tan (S\u201994\u2013M\u201903) received the B.Eng (Hons.), M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 1995, 1998, and 2003, respectively.","From 2001 to 2002, he was a Senior R&D Engineer with a spin-off company of NTU specializing in advanced audio products.

presently ubiquitous in the context of mobile wireless communications among other application domains. A decoder for such codes is typically the most power intensive component in the baseband processing chain of a wireless receiver. The iterative nature of these decoders represents a dynamic workload. This brief presents a dynamic power management policy for these decoders. An algorithm is proposed to tune a power manageable decoder according to a prediction of the workload involved within the decoding task. By reclaiming the timing slack left when operating the decoder at a high power mode, the proposed algorithm continuously looks for opportunities to switch to a lower power mode that guarantees the task completion. We apply this technique to an long term evolution Turbo decoder and explore the feasibility of a VLSI implementation on a CMOS technology of 65 nm. Energy savings of up to 54% were achieved with a relatively low loss in error-correction performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2167765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6252108/06042349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2167765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6252108","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Power Management for the Iterative Decoding of Turbo Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power Management for the Iterative Decoding of Turbo Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12884076","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6042349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Power Management for the Iterative Decoding of Turbo Codes","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-amador-2167765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086051S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6042349","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6042353,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshitomo Hatakeyama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hosei University, Koganei, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshitomo","lastName":"Hatakeyama","id":"38241938900"},{"name":"Kazuki Nomoto","affiliation":["Research Center of Micro-Nano Technology, Hosei University, Koganei, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Nomoto","id":"37960001600"},{"name":"Naoki Kaneda","affiliation":["Corporate Advanced Technology Group, Hitachi Cable Limited, Tsuchiura, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Kaneda","id":"38061354300"},{"name":"Toshihiro Kawano","affiliation":["Corporate Advanced Technology Group, Hitachi Cable Limited, Tsuchiura, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Kawano","id":"37348103600"},{"name":"Tomoyoshi Mishima","affiliation":["Corporate Advanced Technology Group, Hitachi Cable Limited, Tsuchiura, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyoshi","lastName":"Mishima","id":"37302459900"},{"name":"Tohru Nakamura","affiliation":["Research Center of Micro-Nano Technology, Hosei University, Koganei, Japan"],"firstName":"Tohru","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37335621500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6042353","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1611},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Substrates","Periodic structures","P-n junctions","P-i-n diodes","Passivation","Plasmas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","p-n junctions","power semiconductor diodes","substrates","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-n junction diodes","free-standing substrates","two-step electrode process","low specific ON-resistance","high breakdown voltage","anode electrodes","sputtering process","field-plate structure","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breakdown voltage","gallium nitride","power semiconductor devices"]}],"abstract":"This letter describes a new two-step electrode process on p-GaN and characteristics of GaN p-n junction diodes on free-standing GaN substrates with low specific ON-resistance R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03bfn</sub>\n and high breakdown voltage V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n.

The coefficients of the endmembers for each pixel are called proportions. The endmembers and proportions are often the sought-after quantities; the full image is an intermediate representation used to calculate them. Here, a method for estimating proportions and endmembers directly from compressively sensed hyperspectral data based on \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LMM</i>\n is shown. Consequently, proportions and endmembers can be calculated directly from compressively sensed data with no need to reconstruct full hyperspectral images. If spectral information is required, endmembers can be reconstructed using compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, given known endmembers, the proportions of the associated materials can be measured directly using a compressive sensing imaging device. This device would produce a multiband image; the bands would directly represent the material proportions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directly Measuring Material Proportions Using Hyperspectral Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2167652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06042357.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2167652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Directly Measuring Material Proportions Using Hyperspectral Compressive Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6042357/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directly Measuring Material Proportions Using Hyperspectral Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zare-2167652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05457S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6042357","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6042359,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059695/6042359/6042359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Plaza (M'05\u2013SM'07) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.","He was a Visiting Researcher with the Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, with the Applied Information Sciences Branch, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, and with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Data Facility, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.

Knowledge of this historical process would however aid to understand how WiMAX has become the widespread technology that it is today. Furthermore, it would give insight in the steps to undertake for anyone aiming at introducing a new wireless technology on a worldwide scale. Therefore, this article presents a survey on all relevant activities that took place within three important organizations: the 802.16 Working Group of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) for technology development and standardization, the WiMAX Forum for product certification and the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) for international recognition. An elaborated and comprehensive overview of all those activities is given, which reveals the importance of the willingness to innovate and to continuously incorporate new ideas in the IEEE standardization process and the importance of the WiMAX Forum certification label granting process to ensure interoperability. We also emphasize the steps that were taken in cooperating with the ITU to improve the international esteem of the technology. Finally, a WiMAX trend analysis is made. We showed how industry interest has fluctuated over time and quantified the evolution in WiMAX product certification and deployments. It is shown that most interest went to the 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz frequencies, that most deployments are in geographic regions with a lot of developing countries and that the highest people coverage is achieved in Asia Pacific. This elaborated description of all standardization and certification activities, from the very start up to now, will make the reader comprehend how past and future steps are taken in the development process of new WiMAX features.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.16 Standards","WiMAX","Metropolitan area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX","Mobile

For each humanoid robot, three cameras and a computer are equipped to form a stereovision system and a monocular vision system. The stereovision system consisting of two smart cameras and a computer measures the 3-dimensional position of the table tennis ball. It adopts parallel processing mode in order to realize hundred frames level measurement per second. A high-speed digital camera and the computer compose the monocular vision system, which measures the pose of the robot relative to the table via a color mark attached on the robot. The two smart cameras in each stereovision system are synchronized via I/O signals. The vision systems for the two robots are synchronized by time verification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the designed vision system and the proposed methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system with multiple cameras designed for humanoid robots to play table tennis","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CASE.2011.6042396","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033676/6042395/06042396.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE.2011.6042396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A vision system with multiple cameras designed for humanoid robots to play table tennis","conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042396/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305534","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system with multiple cameras designed for humanoid robots to play table tennis","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120437S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033676","isNumber":"6042395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033676","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6042395","articleId":"6042396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042409,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Oil-free bearing has merits that the continuous operation is possible because the lubrication system is not required and the refrigerant is not contaminated by the oil. This paper presents the design procedure of thrust hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB) and its controller for turbo refrigerant compressor. Thrust HMB consists of permanent magnet and electromagnet and it is designed to support 2,000N thrust force by compressor at 21,000rpm operating speed. After building the thrust bearing test rig and control system with PID controller, plant model of hybrid thrust bearing was established by measuring FRF(frequency response function) from the test rig. Based on FRF, PID gain was optimized and the test rotor was successfully levitated with 4.7\u00b5m standard deviation from the reference axial position. The additional DOB(disturbance observer) was designed to attenuate the low frequency disturbance and the measured error sensitivity transfer function shows that DOB works well as it has designed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305547","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and control for hybrid magnetic thrust bearing for turbo refrigerant compressor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and control for hybrid magnetic thrust bearing for turbo refrigerant compressor","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050456S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","isNumber":"6042395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033676","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6042409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6042425,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Pampuri","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Pampuri","id":"37889175100"},{"name":"Andrea Schirru","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Schirru","id":"37901847200"},{"name":"Giuseppe Fazio","affiliation":["Numonyx, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Fazio","id":"37271249500"},{"name":"Giuseppe De Nicolao","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"De Nicolao","id":"37300726900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1732-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1730-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1731-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"6042425","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":494},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Lasso applied to Virtual Metrology in semiconductor manufacturing","abstract":"In semiconductor manufacturing, the state of the art for wafer quality control is based on product monitoring and feedback control loops; the related metrology operations, that usually involve scanning electron microscopes, are particularly cost-intensive and time-consuming. It is therefore not possible to evaluate every wafer: commonly, a small subset of a productive lot is measured at the metrology station and delegated to represent the whole lot. Virtual Metrology (VM) methodologies aim to obtain reliable estimates of metrology results without actually performing measurement operations; this goal is usually achieved by means of statistical models, linking process data and context information to target measurements. In this paper, we tackle two of the most important issues in VM: (i) regression in high dimensional spaces where few variables are meaningful, and (ii) data heterogeneity caused by inhomogeneous production and equipment logistics. We propose a hierarchical framework based on \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-penalized machine learning techniques and solved by means of multitask learning strategies.

However, in these fields, applications require dexterous and skillful manipulation. Hence, realizing high productivity is still difficult. To solve this problem, assisted cell manipulation and automated systems have been researched and microfluidic channel technology has been used in these fields. Most research focuses on only one part of the cell manipulation process, such as the cutting or sorting of cells. In the meantime, less attention has been paid to methods of supplying the target cells to a microfluidic channel. We have developed a multiple cell supply system for the microfluidic channel to realize automated cell cloning. This system sucks bovine egg cells with a size of 100[\u03bcm] and sends them to the microfluidic channel, then finally sends them to the cell manipulation part. It consists of a microfluidic channel, a pump, solenoid valves, camera systems, and an automatic stage. The cell supply action can be realized by controlling these parts through a computer program.","doi":"10.1109/CASE.2011.6042486","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033676/6042395/06042486.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE.2011.6042486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple cell suction and supply system for automated cell manipulation on microfluidic channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042486/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple cell suction and supply system for automated cell manipulation on microfluidic channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305624","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042486/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple cell suction and supply system for automated cell manipulation on microfluidic channel","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"0173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099827S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033676","isNumber":"6042395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033676","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6042395","articleId":"6042486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6042503,"authors":[{"name":"Ethan Stump","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ethan","lastName":"Stump","id":"37591317100"},{"name":"Nathan Michael","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Michael","id":"37302499000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1732-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1730-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1731-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"6042503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":992},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-robot persistent surveillance planning as a Vehicle Routing Problem","abstract":"We consider a persistent surveillance problem as one of finding sequences of visits to discrete sites in a periodic fashion, cast it as a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, and solve it using exact methods developed in the operations research community.

Unlike previous techniques, our method combines learned local shape priors with constraints that are directly derived from the current curvature of the model in order to restrict adaptation to regions where large deformations are expected and observed. Our approach is based on a multi-tiered framework that is more robust against model initialization errors than existing methods, because the model's degrees of freedom are step-wise increased. We evaluated our method on a large data base of 86 CT liver scans from different vendors, protocols, varying resolution and contrast enhancement. For comparison, 50 of the scans were taken from 2 public data bases, one of it being the MICCAI'07 liver segmentation challenge data base. Evaluation shows state of the art results with an average mean surface distance between 1.3 mm and 1.85 mm compared to ground truth depending on the image resolution. With an average segmentation time of 45 seconds our approach outperforms other automatic methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.2010.6042650","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032141/6042608/06042650.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.2010.6042650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast automatic liver segmentation combining learned shape priors with observed shape deviation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast automatic liver segmentation combining learned shape priors with observed shape deviation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/6042650/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12305226","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast automatic liver segmentation combining learned shape priors with observed shape deviation","confLoc":"Bentley, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065185S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6032141","isNumber":"6042608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032141","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6042608","articleId":"6042650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":6042721,"authors":[{"name":"Iyad Amro","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Birzeit University, Israel"],"firstName":"Iyad","lastName":"Amro","id":"37893385200"},{"name":"Wassel Ghanem","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Birzeit University, Israel"],"firstName":"Wassel","lastName":"Ghanem","id":"37888709400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0817-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4449-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6042721","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Interchannel interference","GSM","Heuristic algorithms","Radio spectrum management","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","encoding","genetic algorithms","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GSM automatic frequency planning","genetic algorithms","mobile services","mobile allocated spectrum","optimum frequency allocation","alphabetical encoding","system parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evloutionary Algorithm","Genetic Algorithm (GA)","crossover","mutation","GSM","TCH","SDCCH","TCH"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042721","abstract":"Due to the high demand of mobile services, and the full loading of the mobile allocated spectrum, a very tight frequency reuse schemes appeared, and high levels of interference occurred and due to the overlap of cells, which in turn made it very difficult to allocate frequencies for the different cells in the cellular system.

The significance of this work is introducing an agent-based paradigm for constructing software tools and testbeds for cloud resource management. The novel contributions of this work include: 1) developing Cloudle: an agent-based search engine for cloud service discovery, 2) showing that agent-based negotiation mechanisms can be effectively adopted for bolstering cloud service negotiation and cloud commerce, and 3) showing that agent-based cooperative problem-solving techniques can be effectively adopted for automating cloud service composition. Cloudle consists of 1) a service discovery agent that consults a cloud ontology for determining the similarities between providers' service specifications and consumers' service requirements, and 2) multiple cloud crawlers for building its database of services. Cloudle supports three types of reasoning: similarity reasoning, compatibility reasoning, and numerical reasoning. To support cloud commerce, this work devised a complex cloud negotiation mechanism that supports parallel negotiation activities in interrelated markets: a cloud service market between consumer agents and broker agents, and multiple cloud resource markets between broker agents and provider agents. Empirical results show that using the complex cloud negotiation mechanism, agents achieved high utilities and high success rates in negotiating for cloud resources. To automate cloud service composition, agents in this work adopt a focused selection contract net protocol (FSCNP) for dynamically selecting cloud services and use service capability tables (SCTs) to record the list of cloud agents and their services. Empirical results show that using FSCNP and SCTs, agents can successfully compose cloud services by autonomously selecting services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agent-Based Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2011.52","startPage":"564","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2011.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6365209/06042853.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","displayDocTitle":"Agent-Based Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6042853/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","accessionNumber":"13150452","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent-Based Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tsc2012040564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092654S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6365209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6365209","articleId":"6042853","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6042863,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Nusairat","affiliation":["Motorola Solutions, Hoffman Estates, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ashraf","lastName":"Nusairat","id":"37869855100"},{"name":"Xiang-Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37280866600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6042863","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1054},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","WiMAX","Throughput","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiMAX/OFDMA burst scheduling algorithm","maximize scheduled data","OFDMA resource allocation algorithm","basestation","subcarrier allocation","downlink TDD OFDMA subframe structure","subchannel","rectangular burst","downlink subframe","WiMAX TDD OFDMA system","downlink system throughput","partially used subcarrier subchannalization permutation mode","best channel burst assignment","downlink OFDMA subframe","PUSC subchannalization permutation mode","user channel quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX","OFDMA","wireless scheduling","burst scheduling","throughput maximization"]}],"abstract":"OFDMA resource allocation algorithms manage the distribution and assignment of shared OFDMA resources among the users serviced by the basestation. The OFDMA resource allocation algorithms determine which users to schedule, how to allocate subcarriers to them, and how to determine the appropriate power levels for each user on each subcarrier. In WiMAX, the downlink (DL) TDD OFDMA subframe structure is a rectangular area of N subchannels \\times K time slots. Users are assigned rectangular bursts in the downlink subframe. The size of burst, in terms of number of subchannels and number of time slots, varies based on the user's channel quality and data to be transmitted for the assigned user. In this paper, we study the problem of assigning users to bursts in WiMAX TDD OFDMA system with the objective of maximizing downlink system throughput for the Partially Used subcarrier (PUSC) subchannalization permutation mode. Our main contributions in this paper are: 1) we propose different methods to assign bursts to users, 2) we prove that our Best Channel burst assignment method achieves throughput within a constant factor of the optimal, 3) through extensive simulations with real system parameters, we study the performance of the Best Channel burst assignment method. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the problem of DL Burst Assignment in the downlink OFDMA subframe for PUSC subchannalization permutation mode taking user's channel quality into consideration in the assignment process.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6308604/06042863.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiMAX/OFDMA Burst Scheduling Algorithm to Maximize Scheduled Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042863/","displayDocTitle":"WiMAX/OFDMA Burst Scheduling Algorithm to Maximize Scheduled Data","volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999225","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042863/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiMAX/OFDMA Burst Scheduling Algorithm to Maximize Scheduled Data","sourcePdf":"ttm2012111692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099319S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","isNumber":"6308604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6042863","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6042865,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lingjie","lastName":"Duan","id":"37404722200"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Network Communications and Economics Laboratory, Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293538200"},{"name":"Biying Shou","affiliation":["Department of Management Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Biying","lastName":"Shou","id":"37392004200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6042865","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1343},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Bandwidth","Investments","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Games","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","oligopoly","pricing","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duopoly competition","dynamic spectrum leasing","pricing","competitive secondary operator investment","transmission power","channel conditions","three-stage dynamic game","backward induction","dynamic game equilibria","equilibrium price","leasing costs","signal-to-noise ratio","channel gain","duopoly equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum trading","dynamic spectrum leasing","spectrum pricing","multistage dynamic game","subgame perfect equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive analytical study of two competitive secondary operators' investment (i.e., spectrum leasing) and pricing strategies, taking into account operators' heterogeneity in leasing costs and users' heterogeneity in transmission power and channel conditions. We model the interactions between operators and users as a three-stage dynamic game, where operators simultaneously make spectrum leasing decisions in Stage I, and pricing decisions in Stage II, and then users make purchase decisions in Stage III. Using backward induction, we are able to completely characterize the dynamic game's equilibria. We show that both operators' investment and pricing equilibrium decisions process interesting threshold properties. For example, when the two operators' leasing costs are close, both operators will lease positive spectrum. Otherwise, one operator will choose not to lease and the other operator becomes the monopolist. For pricing, a positive pure strategy equilibrium exists only when the total spectrum investment of both operators is less than a threshold. Moreover, two operators always choose the same equilibrium price despite their heterogeneity in leasing costs. Each user fairly achieves the same service quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the equilibrium, and the obtained predictable payoff is linear in its transmission power and channel gain. We also compare the duopoly equilibrium with the coordinated case where two operators cooperate to maximize their total profit. We show that the maximum loss of total profit due to operators' competition is no larger than 25 percent. The users, however, always benefit from operators' competition in terms of their payoffs. We show that most of these insights are robust in the general SNR regime.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6308604/06042865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308604","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duopoly Competition in Dynamic Spectrum Leasing and Pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Duopoly Competition in Dynamic Spectrum Leasing and Pricing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999227","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6042865/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duopoly Competition in Dynamic Spectrum Leasing and Pricing","sourcePdf":"ttm2012111706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064038S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","isNumber":"6308604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"80","articleId":"6042865","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042868,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Markham, ONT, Canada","Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6335093/6042868/6042868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Feng received the bachelor\u2019s degree and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

The sparse nature of location finding makes the theory of Compressive Sensing (CS) desirable for accurate indoor positioning using Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access Points (APs). We propose an accurate RSS-based indoor positioning system using the theory of compressive sensing, which is a method to recover sparse signals from a small number of noisy measurements by solving an `1-minimization problem. Our location estimator consists of a coarse localizer, where the RSS is compared to a number of clusters to detect in which cluster the node is located, followed by a fine localization step, using the theory of compressive sensing, to further refine the location estimation. We have investigated different coarse localization schemes and AP selection approaches to increase the accuracy. We also show that the CS theory can be used to reconstruct the RSS radio map from measurements at only a small number of fingerprints, reducing the number of measurements significantly. We have implemented the proposed system on a WiFi-integrated mobile device and have evaluated the performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to substantial improvement on localization accuracy and complexity over the widely used traditional fingerprinting methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","volume":"11","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13064164","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6042868/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Received-Signal-Strength-Based Indoor Positioning Using Compressive Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Received-Signal-Strength-Based Indoor Positioning Using Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"ttm2012121983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114181S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6335093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"392","xplore-issue":"6335093","articleId":"6042868","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6042872,"authors":[{"name":"Arjan Gijsenij","affiliation":["Alten PTS, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Arjan","lastName":"Gijsenij","id":"37393509500"},{"name":"Theo Gevers","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain","Intelligent Systems Laboratory Amsterdam (ISLA), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Gevers","id":"37269830500"},{"name":"Joost van de Weijer","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center (CVC), Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Joost","lastName":"van de Weijer","id":"37295645400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"6042872","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1689},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Color","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","Gray codes","image colour analysis","iterative methods","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photometric edge weighting","edge-based color constancy methods","image derivatives","illuminant estimation","edge-based taxonomy","performance evaluation","shadow edge","specular edge","iterative weighted Gray-Edge algorithm","median angular error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color constancy","illuminant estimation","Gray Edge","edge classification."]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Color Constancy by Photometric Edge Weighting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042872","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.197","startPage":"918","endPage":"929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6171978/06042872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6171978","abstract":"Edge-based color constancy methods make use of image derivatives to estimate the illuminant. However, different edge types exist in real-world images, such as material, shadow, and highlight edges. These different edge types may have a distinctive influence on the performance of the illuminant estimation. Therefore, in this paper, an extensive analysis is provided of different edge types on the performance of edge-based color constancy methods. First, an edge-based taxonomy is presented classifying edge types based on their photometric properties (e.g., material, shadow-geometry, and highlights). Then, a performance evaluation of edge-based color constancy is provided using these different edge types. From this performance evaluation, it is derived that specular and shadow edge types are more valuable than material edges for the estimation of the illuminant. To this end, the (iterative) weighted Gray-Edge algorithm is proposed in which these edge types are more emphasized for the estimation of the illuminant. Images that are recorded under controlled circumstances demonstrate that the proposed iterative weighted Gray-Edge algorithm based on highlights reduces the median angular error with approximately 25 percent. In an uncontrolled environment, improvements in angular error up to 11 percent are obtained with respect to regular edge-based color constancy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042872/","volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12617609","pubMedId":"22442121","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving Color Constancy by Photometric Edge Weighting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Color Constancy by Photometric Edge Weighting","sourcePdf":"ttp2012050918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044093S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6171978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"106","articleId":"6042872","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6042881,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Hinterstoisser","affiliation":["Department of Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei Munchen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6171978/6042881/6042881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Hinterstoisser is working toward the PhD degree at the CAMP at the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen in Germany, where he is a part of the Computer Vision Group.

At its core, our approach is a novel image representation for template matching designed to be robust to small image transformations. This robustness is based on spread image gradient orientations and allows us to test only a small subset of all possible pixel locations when parsing the image, and to represent a 3D object with a limited set of templates. In addition, we demonstrate that if a dense depth sensor is available we can extend our approach for an even better performance also taking 3D surface normal orientations into account. We show how to take advantage of the architecture of modern computers to build an efficient but very discriminant representation of the input images that can be used to consider thousands of templates in real time. We demonstrate in many experiments on real data that our method is much faster and more robust with respect to background clutter than current state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6171978/06042881.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6171978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient Response Maps for Real-Time Detection of Textureless Objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Real time systems","Three dimensional displays","Image edge detection","Training","Clutter","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","gradient methods","image matching","image representation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient response map","real-time detection","textureless object","3D object instance detection","image representation","template matching","spread image gradient orientation","dense depth sensor","3D surface normal orientation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","real-time detection and object recognition","tracking","multimodality template matching."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Reproducibility of Results","Surface Properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Gradient Response Maps for Real-Time Detection of Textureless Objects","volume":"34","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6042881/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12617612","pubMedId":"22442120","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient Response Maps for Real-Time Detection of Textureless Objects","sourcePdf":"ttp2012050876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082329S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6171978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"6171978","articleId":"6042881","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6042883,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6247420/6042883/6042883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Yang received the BS degree with honors from Tsinghua University in 2006, the master\u2019s of philosophy degree in industrial engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2008, and is currently working toward the PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.

Our benchmark protocols focus on action similarity (same/not-same), rather than action classification, and testing is performed on never-before-seen actions. We propose this data set and benchmark as a means for gaining a more principled understanding of what makes actions different or similar, rather than learning the properties of particular action classes. We present baseline results on our benchmark, and compare them to human performance. To promote further study of action similarity techniques, we make the ASLAN database, benchmarks, and descriptor encodings publicly available to the research community.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6136512/06042884.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6136512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Action Similarity Labeling Challenge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Action Similarity Labeling Challenge","volume":"34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487348","pubMedId":"22262724","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042884/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042884/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Action Similarity Labeling Challenge","sourcePdf":"ttp2012030615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130861S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6136512","articleId":"6042884","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6042890,"authors":[{"name":"Mark F.

The two receivers have a relationship defined by the local structure of the underlying graphical model, and are inhibited by the same phenomenon, which we call pseudoconfigurations. This concept is a generalization of the concept of pseudocodewords for linear codes. It is proved that the LP receiver has the `maximum likelihood certificate' property, and that the receiver output is the lowest cost pseudoconfiguration. Equivalence of graph-cover pseudoconfigurations and linear-programming pseudoconfigurations is also proved. A concept of system pseudodistance is defined which generalizes the existing concept of pseudodistance for binary and nonbinary linear codes. It is demonstrated how the LP design technique may be applied to the problem of joint equalization and decoding of coded transmissions over a frequency selective channel, and a simulation-based analysis of the error events of the resulting LP receiver is also provided. For this particular application, the proposed LP receiver is shown to be competitive with other receivers, and to be capable of outperforming turbo equalization in bit and frame error rate performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06042890.pdf","startPage":"3375","endPage":"3387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Framework for Linear-Programming Based Communication Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Cost function","Maximum likelihood decoding","Optimized production technology","Decoding","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","linear programming","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified framework","linear programming","communication receivers","sum product algorithm","cost pseudoconfiguration","joint equalization","decoding","outperforming turbo equalization","bit and frame","error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear-programming","factor graphs","sum-product algorithm","decoding","equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Framework for Linear-Programming Based Communication Receivers","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6042890/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425630","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Framework for Linear-Programming Based Communication Receivers","sourcePdf":"3375-tc1112-flanagan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071838S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6042890","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042891,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6085845/6042891/6042891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Qian obtained his M.S. degree in Electronics and Communications from Southeast University, China, in 1998. after that, he joined Department of Electronics Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University.

Providing service to Secondary Users (SUs) with spectrum bought from Primary Users (PUs), the agent can make profits during the process by providing service to secondary users. During each trading period, the agent has to decide how much spectrum it should lease from PUs and what price it should charge SUs. Therefore, the most significant challenge to implement this spectrum trading model is finding the most profitable strategy for agent(s). We address this challenge under two scenarios in which: 1) a single agent and 2) multiple agents. Instead of quantifying SUs' spectrum demand by a deterministic function of price, we take the randomness of secondary users' demand or demand uncertainty into consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution to agent-based spectrum trading considering demand uncertainty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6042891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","volume":"59","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12388295","publicationDate":"November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6042891/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: An Agent-Based Model under Demand Uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: An Agent-Based Model under Demand Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"3192-tc1111-qian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092858S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6042891","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6042892,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Han","id":"37293173300"},{"name":"See Ho Ting","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"See Ho","lastName":"Ting","id":"37270082500"},{"name":"Ashish Pandharipande","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Pandharipande","id":"37266388400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6042892","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Strontium","Radio transmitters","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","protocols","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sharing protocol","spectrum access","selective relaying primary system","transmitter-receiver pair","multiuser system","decode-and-forward relay","interference constraint","two-phase protocol","cooperative relaying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing","cooperative protocols","relay selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6042892","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a two-phase protocol based on cooperative relaying for a secondary system to achieve spectrum access along with a selective relaying primary system.

This paper explores novel ways of customising data communication between accelerator nodes, which is often a bottleneck when scaling up the cluster size. Based on the direct connection of high speed serial links between advanced reconfigurable devices, we develop and evaluate CusComNet, a scalable, flexible and efficient communication framework. The CusComNet framework is built around customisable, packet-based communication and supports three main types of customisation: packet protocol customisation, system-level customisation, and prioritised communication customisation. A performance model for estimating CusComNet's communication latency is proposed and demonstrated. Our framework is applied to a 16-node cluster, each node of which contains an FPGA accelerator which can be connected directly to other FPGA accelerators. The proposed framework can be used to improve the scalability of a reconfigurable cluster by involving more nodes in a single application. Performance measurements show high efficiency data throughput for both large and small data volumes, as well as low communication overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043231/","accessionNumber":"12305498","displayDocTitle":"CusComNet: A customisable network for reconfigurable heterogeneous clusters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CusComNet: A customisable network for reconfigurable heterogeneous clusters","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p009paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072683S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033675","isNumber":"6043218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033675","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6043218","articleId":"6043231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6043234,"authors":[{"name":"Ardavan Pedram","affiliation":["School of Geology Engineering and Geomatics, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Xi'an, P.

It is well-accepted that application-specific custom hardware can achieve orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency. The question is whether such efficiency can be maintained while providing enough flexibility to implement a broad class of operations. In this paper, we aim to answer this question for the domain of matrix computations. We propose a design of a novel linear algebra core and demonstrate that it can achieve orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency for matrix-matrix multiplication, an operation that is indicative for a broad class of matrix computations.

The key metrics in designing network virtual routers are (1) number of supported virtual router instances, (2) total number of prefixes, and (3) ability to quickly update the virtual table. Existing merging algorithms use leaf pushing and a shared next hop data structure to eliminate the large memory bandwidth requirement. However, the size of the shared next hop table grows linearly with the number of virtual routers. Due to the limited amount of on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), existing designs cannot support large number of tables and/or large number of prefixes. This paper exploits the abundant parallelism and on-chip memory bandwidth available in the state-of-the-art FPGAs, and proposes a compact trie representation and a hybrid data structure to reduce the memory requirement of virtual routers. The approach does not require leaf-pushing; therefore, reduces the size of each entry of the data structure. Our algorithm demonstrates substantial reduction in the memory footprint compared with the state-of-the-art. Also, it eliminates the shared next hop information data structure and simplifies the table updates in virtual routers. Using a state-of-the-art FPGA, the proposed architecture can support up to 3.1M IPv4 prefixes. Employing the dual-ported memory available in the current FPGAs, we map the proposed data structure on a novel SRAMbased linear pipeline architecture to achieve high throughput.

The accelerators are implemented with online arithmetic to maximize throughput, while still providing practical power and area costs.

However, this algorithm is computational intensive. In addition, although this algorithm can tolerant noise in the input images, such as the noise due to snow, rain, or camera shaking, it is sensitive to the noise from the internal computing circuits, such as the noise due to soft errors or PVT (process, voltage, and temperature) variation. Tolerating this kind of noise becomes more and more important as device scaling continues to nanoscale dimensions. Stochastic computing, which uses streams of random bits (stochastic bits streams) to perform computation with conventional digital logic gates, can guarantee reliable computation using unreliable devices. In this paper, we present a stochastic computing implementation of the KDE-based image segmentation algorithm. Our experimental results show that, under the same time constraint, the stochastic implementation is much more tolerant of faults and consumes less hardware and power compared to a conventional (nonstochastic) implementation. Furthermore, compared to a Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) fault tolerance technique, the stochastic architecture tolerates substantially more soft errors with lower power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033675/6043218/06043264.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power fault-tolerance architecture for the kernel density estimation based image segmentation algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Encoding","Equations","Noise","Kernel","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","fault tolerant computing","image segmentation","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power fault-tolerance architecture","kernel density estimation based image segmentation algorithm","KDE","device scaling","stochastic computing","triple modular redundancy fault tolerance technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer reliability","fault tolerance","logic design","stochastic computing","image segmentation","low-power","low-energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A low power fault-tolerance architecture for the kernel density estimation based image segmentation algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305515","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power fault-tolerance architecture for the kernel density estimation based image segmentation algorithm","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p161paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084778S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033675","isNumber":"6043218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033675","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6043218","articleId":"6043264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6043267,"authors":[{"name":"F. de Dinechin","affiliation":["CNRS, ENS Lyon, INRIA, UCBL, Laboratoire LIP, ENS Lyon, 46 all\u00e9e d'Italie, 69364 Cedex 07, FRANCE"],"firstName":"F. de","lastName":"Dinechin","id":"37087068769"},{"name":"J.-M.

Having linearized reference genomes available, the alignment of short DNA reads obtained from the sequencing of an individual genome against such a database provides a powerful diagnostic and analysis tool. In essence, this task amounts to a simple string search tolerating a certain number of mismatches to account for the diversity of individuals. The complexity of this process arises from the sheer size of the reference genome. It is further amplified by current next-generation sequencing technologies, which produce a huge number of increasingly short reads. These short reads hurt established alignment heuristics like BLAST severely. This paper proposes an FPGA-based custom computation, which performs the alignment of short DNA reads in a timely manner by the use of tremendous concurrency for reasonable costs. The special measures to achieve an extremely efficient and compact mapping of the computation to a Xilinx FPGA architecture are described. The presented approach also surpasses all software heuristics in the quality of its results. It guarantees to find all alignment locations of a read in the database while also allowing a freely adjustable character mismatch threshold. On the contrary, advanced fast alignment heuristics like Bowtie and Maq can only tolerate small mismatch maximums with a quick deterioration of the probability to detect existing valid alignments. The performance comparison with these widely used software tools also demonstrates that the proposed FPGA computation achieves its guaranteed exact results in very competitive time.","publicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033675/6043218/06043268.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Next-generation massively parallel short-read mapping on FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Next-generation massively parallel short-read mapping on FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305519","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043268/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Next-generation massively parallel short-read mapping on FPGAs","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p195paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071723S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033675","isNumber":"6043218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033675","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6043218","articleId":"6043268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6043269,"authors":[{"name":"Rodolfo Redlich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepcion, Chile"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Redlich","id":"37886556000"},{"name":"Gonzalo Carvajal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepcion, Chile"],"firstName":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Carvajal","id":"37895481600"},{"name":"Miguel Figueroa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepcion, Chile"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Figueroa","id":"38482957200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1292-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1291-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1290-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-0511"}],"articleNumber":"6043269","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based real-time nonuniformity correction system for Infrared Focal Plane Arrays","displayPublicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033675/6043218/06043269.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043218","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043269","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Clocks","Program processors","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Detectors","Blanking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","infrared imaging","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based real-time nonuniformity correction system","infrared focal plane arrays","nonuniformity correction algorithm","scene-based constant range algorithm","adaptive nonuniformity correction","NTSC infrared video signal","external memory bandwidth","power 157 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","nonuniformity correction","scene-based calibration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043269","abstract":"Spatial and temporal nonuniformity in Infrared Focal Plane Arrays (IRFPA) severely degrades the quality of images obtained from modern infrared cameras.

However, many conventional fault injection methods face significant shortcomings, which hinder their ability to execute fault injections on target real-time safety-critical systems. We demonstrate a novel fault injection system implemented on a commercial Field-Programmable Gate Array board. The fault injector is unobtrusive to the target system as it utilizes only standardized On-Chip-Debugger (OCD) interfaces present on most current processors. This effort resulted in faults being injected orders of magnitude faster than by utilizing a commercial OCD debugger, while incorporating novel features such as concurrent injection of faults into distinct target processors. The effectiveness of this high performance fault injector was successfully demonstrated on a tightly synchronized commercial real-time safety-critical system used in nuclear power applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Program processors","Real time systems","Hardware","Computers","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","program debugging","safety-critical software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based fault injector","real-time safety-critical systems","fault tolerance","field-programmable gate array board","on-chip-debugger interfaces","nuclear power applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Injection","On-Chip-Debugger Interface","FPGA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043278","publicationTitle":"ASAP 2011 -

To better utilize the reconfigurable hardware resource and to explore the opportunity of kernel sharing across applications, we propose to use a dedicated domain-specific computing platform.

As a more efficient symbol detection algorithm through sparse channels, the iterative belief propagation (BP) algorithm has a complexity merely dependent on the number of nonzero channel coefficients, while achieving a near-optimal error performance.

Randomness equations are derived, to understand efficiency of these derivations, hand calculation and simulation results are compared. For this purpose, two cases are studied: Inverter-based Ring Oscillators (IbRO) and Differential Ring Oscillators (DROs). 0.35\u03bcm standard CMOS process has been used with a supply voltage of 3.3V for designs and analysis. For both ROs, randomness increases with decreasing energy.

The VLS was designed in CMOS 0.18um process. Simulation results, at the layout extraction level, are presented to validate the design concept. The speed and energy consumption of the VLS are compared with the state of the art VLSs.

The main idea is that of segmentation and transformation of the temporal signal into a 1D spatial one which is further processed by means of a bank of linear spatial filters using a parallel architecture of CNN type. A major advantage of the proposed solution is the independence of the filters spatial frequency characteristics on the number of samples of the ECG pattern, which allows dealing very easily with the heart rate variability. The principle of the proposed architecture is briefly discussed and the design of a bank of spatial filters for ECG classification is presented.

Every new scale is the result of a smoothing operator on a former scale. In image processing, scale-space filtering is widely used in feature extractors as the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. RC networks are posed as valid scale-space generators in focal-plane processing. Switched-capacitor networks are another alternative, as different topologies and switching rate offer a great flexibility. This work examines the parallel and the bilinear implementations as two different switched-capacitor network topologies for scale-space filtering.

Both results characterize a chance for a chaotic behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043322","startPage":"222","endPage":"225","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043322.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Response of the two neuron cellular neural network to time dependent inputs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Mobile communication","Neurons","Chaos","Limit-cycles","Equations","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","chaos","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two neuron cellular neural network","time dependent external inputs","two neuron CNN system","piecewise linear activation function","antisymmetric template","chaotic behavior","system sensitivity","self-intersecting trajectories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Response of the two neuron cellular neural network to time dependent inputs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043322/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305306","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response of the two neuron cellular neural network to time dependent inputs","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p222vinyolesserra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038483S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6043325,"authors":[{"name":"Ion Vornicu","affiliation":["Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Vornicu","id":"37594164400"},{"name":"Liviu Goras","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Romanian Academy, Romania","Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Liviu","lastName":"Goras","id":"37298283200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043325","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Parallel architectures","Equations","Spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","image classification","image texture","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN","texture classification","spatio temporal dynamics","spatial filters","transistor level simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN's","analog parallel architectures","2D spatio-temporal filtering","texture classification"]}],"abstract":"The paper deals with the possibility of using the spatio-temporal dynamics of a class of CNN's for texture classification.

From the viewpoint of the optimal lossless coding, our method is optimized for not only mean squared error (MSE) but also a coding rate. The key idea of this work is that the local structure of an image is modeled by six types of CNN templates in order to achieve high prediction performance, and the CNN parameters that gives prediction characteristic are decided by the supervised minimum coding rate learning. Moreover, in the entropy coding layer, the prediction residuals are coded by an adaptive arithmetic encoder with context modeling for high coding efficiency. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm is confirmed by some computer simulations of various standard test images, and its performance is compared with that of conventional hierarchical coding schemes having scalability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043337/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12305321","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043337/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lossless image coding by cellular neural networks with minimum coding rate learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless image coding by cellular neural networks with minimum coding rate learning","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p33takizawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07622S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6043341,"authors":[{"name":"Keith Finnerty","affiliation":["CTVR-The Telecommunications Research Centre, Callan Institute, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Finnerty","id":"37891641700"},{"name":"John Dooley","affiliation":["CTVR-The Telecommunications Research Centre, Callan Institute, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Dooley","id":"37268227100"},{"name":"Ronan Farrell","affiliation":["CTVR-The Telecommunications Research Centre, Callan Institute, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Farrell","id":"37290828800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043341","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Noise","Frequency modulation","Power amplifiers","Finite impulse response filter","Sigma delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","power amplifiers","sigma-delta modulation","switched mode power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital quadrature mixing","lowpass sigma-delta modulators","switch-mode power amplifiers","phase compensation technique","amplification","image signal","multicarrier signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power amplifiers","delta-sigma converters","class S"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043341","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043341.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital quadrature mixing of lowpass sigma-delta modulators for switch-mode power amplifiers","abstract":"In this paper a phase compensation technique for the digital up conversion of a quadrature signal for amplification with switch mode power amplifiers is proposed. When a digital signal generator is used to generate the complex envelope signal care must be taken to compensate for the phase skew between the two paths. If phase compensation is not implemented an image caused by up converting the complex envelope of the modulation signal is created. By compensating for phase skew between the I and Q signal paths it is possible to remove this image signal and enable the transmission of multi carrier signals.

A single recording amplifier consumes only 25 \u03bcW from 1.8 V supply and occupies 0.13 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of the silicon area. Its main parameters such as the low/high cut off frequencies and the voltage gain are controlled thanks to the on-chip register. User is able to change the low cut off frequency in the 60 mHz - 100 Hz range in each channel independently while the high cut off frequency and the voltage gain can be set to 4.7 kHz / 12 kHz and 139 V/V / 1100 V/V respectively. The input referred noise depends on the bandwidth of the recording channel and is equal to 3.7 \u03bcV (100 Hz - 12 kHz) or to 7.6 \u03bcV (3 Hz - 12 kHz). This paper deals with problems that are present in a multichannel integrated recording electronics for neurobiology experiments such as: ability to record input signals in the frequency range below a single Hz, and the spread of the cut off frequencies from channel to channel in such systems. Up to our knowledge the solution presented in this paper is the first one reporting the multichannel IC that is able both to record extremely low frequency signals in each channel with a small spread of this parameter from channel to channel.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cutoff frequency","Noise","Capacitors","Resistance","CMOS integrated circuits","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","integrated circuit noise","lab-on-a-chip","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low cut-off frequency","multichannel neural recording amplifiers","on-chip correction DAC","multichannel integrated circuits","neurobiological signals","CMOS process","single recording amplifier","noise","multichannel integrated recording electronics","neurobiology","multichannel IC","frequency 60 mHz to 100 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multichannel ASIC","neurobiological experiments","front end recording electronics","correction DAC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043346","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043346.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning the low cut-off frequency in multichannel neural recording amplifiers by the on-chip correction DACs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tuning the low cut-off frequency in multichannel neural recording amplifiers by the on-chip correction DACs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043346/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043346/","accessionNumber":"12305330","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning the low cut-off frequency in multichannel neural recording amplifiers by the on-chip correction DACs","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p302kmon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059276S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6043349,"authors":[{"name":"Saima Athar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Saima","lastName":"Athar","id":"37891831000"},{"name":"Oscar Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37270788100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043349","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Polynomials","Adders","Complexity theory","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","integer programming","linear programming","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AIQ representation","low complexity wavelet transform","discrete wavelet transform","DWT","algebraic integer quantization","irrational transform basis","polynomial","integer coefficient","integer linear programming","ILP model"]}],"abstract":"The Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been used in a wide range of real-time application. Algebraic integer quantization (AIQ) encoding has been proposed to represent the irrational transform basis of the wavelet transform as polynomials with integer coefficients. In this paper, we suggest to restate these polynomials to obtain simpler coefficients for both the integer coefficients and the polynomial basis, while keeping numerically equivalence with the original AIQ coefficient. We present an integer linear programming (ILP) model for restating these linear expressions.

They are also essential to support efficient bottom-up hierarchical design methodologies. Being such a key element in these methodologies, there have been many reported efforts to enhance the fronts with valuable information that goes beyond the nominal circuit behavior, such as the yield or the reconfiguration capabilities. However, the effect of layout parasitics is the factor that has been missing in the literature: the accuracy may be seriously degraded by layout parasitics not considered during the front generation. In this paper, we present a technique to generate layout-aware Pareto fronts that accurately accounts for the impact of both geometry and parasitics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043357","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043357.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"348","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout-aware Pareto fronts of electronic circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Layout-aware Pareto fronts of electronic circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043357/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305341","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043357/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout-aware Pareto fronts of electronic circuits","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p345torofrias.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074469S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6043359,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37903631100"},{"name":"Xingyu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xingyu Zhou","id":"37087744114"},{"name":"Linyong Shen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"lastName":"Linyong Shen","id":"37087303547"},{"name":"Marissa Condon","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Marissa","lastName":"Condon","id":"37264896900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"A novel design methodology is proposed to enable sampling phase-locked loops (SPLL) to synthesise fractional-N frequencies.

Unfortunately, the high levels of transistor integration and performance required by such devices lead to an unprecedented increase of on-chip power that significantly limits the battery lifetime and even poses reliability concerns. Several techniques have been developed to address the power increase, but voltage over-scaling (VOS) is considered to be one of the most effective ones due to the quadratic dependence of voltage on dynamic power consumption. However, VOS may not always be applicable since it increases the delay in all paths of a system and may limit high performance required by today's complex applications. In addition, application of VOS is further complicated since it increases the variations in transistor characteristics imposed by their tiny size which can lead to large delay and leakage variations, making it difficult to meet delay and power budgets.

Radio channels are 2GHz wide, triggering new challenges for the digital circuit designers with sampling frequencies in the GHz range.

The performance in the parabolic architecture is shown to exceed the CORDIC architecture by a factor 4.2, in a 65 nm Standard-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n ASIC implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043642","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043642.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI implementation of logarithmic and exponential functions using a novel parabolic synthesis methodology compared to the CORDIC algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI implementation of logarithmic and exponential functions using a novel parabolic synthesis methodology compared to the CORDIC algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12305440","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043642/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI implementation of logarithmic and exponential functions using a novel parabolic synthesis methodology compared to the CORDIC algorithm","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p709pouyan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055468S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6043644,"authors":[{"name":"Csaba Nemes","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Csaba","lastName":"Nemes","id":"37901796600"},{"name":"Zolt\u00e1n Nagy","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory, Computer and Research Automation Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary","Faculty of Information Technology, P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zolt\u00e1n","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37289561100"},{"name":"P\u00e9ter Szolgay","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory, Computer and Research Automation Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary","Faculty of Information Technology, P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"P\u00e9ter","lastName":"Szolgay","id":"37294347300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043644","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"Computationally intensive problems can be represented with data-flow graphs and automatically transformed to locally controlled floating-point units via partitioning. In theory the lack of global control signals enables high performance implementation however placing and routing of the partitioned circuits are not trivial. In practice to create a high performance implementation the clusters should be placed efficiently on the surface of an FPGA using the physical constraining feature of CAD tools. In the paper a new partitioning strategy is presented which not only minimizes the number of cut nets but produce partition which can be mapped without long interconnections between the clusters. The new strategy is demonstrated during the automatic circuit generation from a complex mathematical expression. The proposed partitioning method produces more cut nets than common strategies however the resulting partition can be easily mapped and operate on significantly higher frequency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043644.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions to FPGAs: Exploring different design methodologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational fluid dynamics","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow graphs","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient mapping","mathematical expressions","FPGA","data-flow graphs","locally controlled floating-point units","partitioning","automatic circuit generation","complex mathematical expression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions to FPGAs: Exploring different design methodologies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043644/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305442","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions to FPGAs: Exploring different design methodologies","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p717nemes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074183S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6043646,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

It can be demonstrated that under certain conditions (such as proper filter coefficient values), a global and a local synchronization can be obtained. Our approach to find the optimal conditions consists of analyzing a corresponding linear average system of the cartesian network rather than constructing a piecewise-linear system which is extremely difficult to analyse. The constructed corresponding system takes into account the non-linearity of the network and especially the self-sampling property. It is then analyzed by linear performance criteria such as modulus margin to guarantee a robust stability of the cartesian network. The reliability of our approach is proved by transient simulations in networks of different sizes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design approach for networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043646","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043646.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A design approach for networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043646/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305444","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design approach for networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p725akre.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067502S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6043653,"authors":[{"name":"Markku Renfors","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Renfors","id":"37279773600"},{"name":"Fred Harris","affiliation":["San Diego State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Harris","id":"37277456200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043653","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Convolution","Bandwidth","Complexity theory","Frequency response","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","digital filters","fast Fourier transforms","high-pass filters","low-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly-adjustable multirate digital filters","fast convolution","FFT-IFFT configuration","forward-inverse orthogonal transform pair","frequency-domain characteristics","frequency bins","filter banks","sharp transition bands","low-pass filter design","bandpass filter design","highpass filter design","multirate FB","spectral containment","highly-tunable analysis FB configuration","perfect-reconstruction FB systems","channel filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043653","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043653","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","abstract":"FFT-IFFT configuration, or more generally a forward-inverse orthogonal transform pair, offers a way to implement a digital filter whose frequency-domain characteristics can be straightforwardly tuned by adjusting the complex gains of the frequency bins. Using filter banks (FBs) for the transform pair, sharp transition bands can be obtained for low-pass/bandpass/highpass type filter designs. However, FBs suffer from relatively high implementation complexity. Fast convolution based multirate FBs constitute and alternative approach which is able to reach high spectral containment together with high flexibility and conceptual simplicity. In this paper we consider a fast convolution based highly tunable analysis FB configuration and show that nearly perfect-reconstruction FB systems can be implemented using this approach. Further, the channel filters of the analysis FB are easily configurable for different bandwidths, center frequencies and output sampling rates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043653.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly adjustable multirate digital filters based on fast convolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043653/","displayDocTitle":"Highly adjustable multirate digital filters based on fast convolution","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305451","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly adjustable multirate digital filters based on fast convolution","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p9renfors.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050612S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6043658,"authors":[{"name":"Delia Mitrea","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Delia","lastName":"Mitrea","id":"37547670500"},{"name":"Sergiu Nedevschi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Nedevschi","id":"37283407700"},{"name":"Radu Badea","affiliation":["I.

The texture is an important property of the internal organs tissue, able to provide subtle information about the pathology.

In that case high level modulation formats (N-PSK) should be performed with DWDM technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Examination of the effect of fixing laser phase noise in Coherent Optical OFDM systems with different channel parameters","publicationTitle":"2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.6043759","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032139/6043654/06043759.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.6043759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Examination of the effect of fixing laser phase noise in Coherent Optical OFDM systems with different channel parameters","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043759/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305023","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examination of the effect of fixing laser phase noise in Coherent Optical OFDM systems with different channel parameters","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066709S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6032139","isNumber":"6043654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6032139","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6043654","articleId":"6043759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6043765,"authors":[{"name":"Sherlie Portugal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sherlie","lastName":"Portugal","id":"37595467600"},{"name":"Saransh Malik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Saransh","lastName":"Malik","id":"37890252600"},{"name":"Changwoo Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changwoo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37591804000"},{"name":"Cheolsung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheolsung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292330000"},{"name":"Intae Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Intae","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37592860700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1411-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1410-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1409-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043765","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043765","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Adaptive systems","MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding complexity reduction","maximum likelihood decoder","error performance","adaptive ordered successive interference cancelation","conventional sphere decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Link Adaptation","MIMO","OSIC","SNR","Sphere Decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.6043765","publicationTitle":"2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6032139/6043654/06043765.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.6043765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of sphere decoding complexity using an adaptive SD-OSIC system","abstract":"Sphere decoding is a technique able to achieve the optimal performance of the maximum likelihood decoder, but its high and variable complexity can make the practical implementation infeasible.

In this paper, the implementation of a decoder for rate-compatible quasi-cyclic LDPC codes is considered. The decoder uses check node merging to increase the convergence speed of the algorithm. Check node merging allows the decoder to achieve the same performance with a significantly lower number of iterations, thereby increasing the throughput. The feasibility of a check node merging decoder is investigated for codes from IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11n. The faster convergence rate of the check node merging algorithm allows the decoder to be implemented using lower parallelization factors, thereby reducing the logic complexity. The designs have been synthesized to an Altera Cyclone II FPGA, and results show significant increases in throughput at high SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of rate-compatible QC-LDPC code decoder","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043844","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043844.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of rate-compatible QC-LDPC code decoder","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043844/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305482","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of rate-compatible QC-LDPC code decoder","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p777blad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038516S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6043845,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Nilsson","affiliation":["CERES and MPE-Laboratory, Halmstad University, Halmstad, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Nilsson","id":"37528204700"},{"name":"Christer Svensson","affiliation":["ISY, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Christer","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37268566200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043845","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1302},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043845","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Sensitivity","Radio frequency","Envelope detectors","Baseband","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","MOSFET","radiofrequency identification","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["envelope detector sensitivity","analytical expressions","low power envelope detector","RF signal","blocking signal","low power wake-up radios","RFID","wireless sensor systems","modern short channel MOS transistor simulations","low power LNA","CW blocker"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents analytical expressions for the sensitivity of a low power envelope detector driven by a weak RF signal in the presence of a blocking signal.

The topology exploits an input level-shifter to keep the common-mode input voltage of a pseudo-differential pair constant, thus providing a constant gain over the whole input common-mode range. The main drawback of the proposed solution is the need of a switched-capacitor level-shifter, that can give rise to some clock feedthrough in continuous-time applications. However good linearity with limited clock intermodulation can be achieved by careful design. An opamp in 65-nm CMOS technology featuring the proposed input stage is operational for supply voltages as low as 0.5 V, with a net linearity improvement with respect to a simple pseudo-differential stage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043846","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043846.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"772","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A very low-voltage differential amplifier for opamp design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A very low-voltage differential amplifier for opamp design","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305484","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A very low-voltage differential amplifier for opamp design","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p769centurelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055625S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6033674","isNumber":"6043284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6033674","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6043284","articleId":"6043846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6043847,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Centurelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Centurelli","id":"37271532900"},{"name":"Pietro Monsurr\u00f2","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Monsurr\u00f2","id":"37423439400"},{"name":"Alessandro Trifiletti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Trifiletti","id":"37271530500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043847","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Topology","MOS devices","Switches","Power demand","Capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","low-power electronics","sample and hold circuits","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-AB very low voltage amplifier","sample and hold circuit","rail-to-rail output swing","SHA circuits","multiplying digital to analog converter","MDAC","low-voltage low-power pipeline analog-to-digital converter","low-power pipeline ADC","STMicroelectronics CMOS process","two-stage amplifier","THD","Nyquist band","power consumption","voltage 0.5 V to 1.0 V","size 65 nm","gain 26 dB","frequency 14 MHz","frequency 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["very low-voltage design","rail-to-rail","opamp design","sample and hold amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043847","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6043284","publicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6033674/6043284/06043847.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class-AB very low voltage amplifier and sample & hold circuit","abstract":"In this paper we present a low-power low-voltage class-AB amplifier with rail-to-rail output swing capable of operating from 0.5 V to 1.0 V of supply voltage, and two Sample & Hold (SHA) circuits based on this amplifier. The bias current and the bandwidth of the amplifier depend on the voltage supply, so that for low-power operation a low supply voltage can be used. The two SHAs have a nominal gain of one and two: as the latter is the basic stage of a Multiplying DAC (MDAC), the proposed amplifier may be used to obtain a low-voltage low-power pipeline Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The design has been validated by simulations using the technology models of the STMicroelectronics 65 nm CMOS process. The two-stage amplifier has a gain of 26 dB at 0.5 V, which increases up to 37 dB at 1.0 V, and a unity gain frequency of 14 MHz when supplied at 0.5 V, which increases beyond 1 GHz at 1.0 V. The two SHAs can work at up to 5 MSps with a 0.5 V supply and consume less than 2 \u03bcW, showing a THD of -56 dB throughout the Nyquist band.

Ensuring accurate visual coverage of the monitoring space with a minimum number of cameras is sought. The visual coverage is defined by realistic and consistent assumptions taking into account camera characteristics. In total, nine evolutionary-like algorithms based on BPSO, Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS) and genetic techniques are adapted to solve this visual coverage based camera network placement problem. All these techniques are introduced in a new and effective framework dealing with constrained optimizations. The performance of BPSO inspired probability technique is compared with the performances of the stochastic variants (e.g., genetic algorithms-based or immune systems-based) of optimization based particle swarm algorithms. Simulation results for 2-D and 3-D scenarios show the efficiency of the proposed technique. Indeed, for a large-scale dimension case, BPSO inspired probability gives better results than the ones obtained by adapting all other variants of BPSO, SA, TS, and genetic techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12650332","htmlLink":"/document/6043848/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Inspired Probability Algorithm for Optimal Camera Network Placement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Inspired Probability Algorithm for Optimal Camera Network Placement","sourcePdf":"jsen-aouf-2170833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100142S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"6043848","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6043849,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Fazli Yeknami","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Devices, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ali Fazli","lastName":"Yeknami","id":"37892328900"},{"name":"Mostafa Savadi Osgooei","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Devices, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mostafa Savadi","lastName":"Osgooei","id":"37892329000"},{"name":"Atila Alvandpour","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Devices, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Atila","lastName":"Alvandpour","id":"37268643400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0618-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0617-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0616-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6043849","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transconductance","Bandwidth","Power demand","Topology","CMOS integrated circuits","Capacitance","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","network topology","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable-bandwidth amplifier","ultra-low-power switched-capacitor application","topology","load-compensated two-stage OTA","GBW","CMOS technology","size 65 nm","frequency 400 kHz","frequency 700 kHz","frequency 900 kHz","gain 52 dB","power 275 nW","power 375 nW","voltage 0.9 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to design a programmable-bandwidth amplifier intended for ultra-low-power switched-capacitor application.

The sensor embeds event detection and energy management capabilities, which meet the requirements of an energy autonomous system. Data compression and fast readout delivering turn into a chip low power performance and duty-cycle optimization of the external processor, devoted to visual processing and communication. A preliminary prototype of vision system has been developed, estimating motion and looking for events occurring in the scene. It consists of the vision sensor interfaced with a small-density CPLD and a tiny micro-controller for data readout and communication.

This is why state-of-the-art wireless sensor systems are mostly battery-based if a high operating range is required. The proposed ultralow-power on-chip sensor unit and off-chip sensor interface which provides enough energy to supply various sensors with a power consumption up to the milliwatt range make it possible to remotely power the proposed RFID tag and use it as wireless sensor node. Equipping sensor nodes with RFID functionality not only enables identification and logistic applications but also an easy integration of the sensing tag into existing RFID systems. Exploiting the different characteristics of HF and UHF RFID systems, namely the large operating range in UHF and the high available power in HF, increases the flexibility and applicability of wireless sensor nodes. This paper presents a remotely powered multifrequency sensing tag according to the EPC HF and EPC Class 1 Gen 2 UHF standard developed in a 0.13-\u03bcm low-cost CMOS process. Input powers of -10.3 or -7.9 dBm at a frequency of 900 MHz are necessary to operate the sensing tag with activated on-chip sensor unit or off-chip sensor interface, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6079316/06043880.pdf","startPage":"3075","endPage":"3088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multifrequency Passive Sensing Tag With On-Chip Temperature Sensor and Off-Chip Sensor Interface Using EPC HF and UHF RFID Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","UHF measurements","System-on-a-chip","Couplings","Temperature sensors","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","radiofrequency identification","temperature sensors","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifrequency passive sensing tag","on-chip temperature sensor","off-chip sensor interface","EPC HF technology","UHF RFID technology","electromagnetic field","wireless sensor systems","ultralow-power on-chip sensor unit","power consumption","wireless sensor node","low-cost CMOS process","size 0.13 mum","frequency 900 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential","electro-magnetic","energy harvesting","high-frequency (HF)","rectifier","single-ended","temperature sensor","ultrahigh-frequency (UHF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Multifrequency Passive Sensing Tag With On-Chip Temperature Sensor and Off-Chip Sensor Interface Using EPC HF and UHF RFID Technology","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388394","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multifrequency Passive Sensing Tag With On-Chip Temperature Sensor and Off-Chip Sensor Interface Using EPC HF and UHF RFID Technology","sourcePdf":"jssc-reinisch-2167548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081943S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6079316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"55","articleId":"6043880","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6043883,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823400"},{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404783000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6043883","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Output feedback","Neural networks","Wheels","Adaptive control","Robot control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","neural network (NN)","output feedback NN control","wheeled inverted pendulum (WIP)"]}],"abstract":"The wheeled inverted pendulum (WIP) models have been widely applied in the transportation vehicles formed by a mobile wheeled inverted pendulum system with an operator (demonstrated in \n<figureref refid=\"fig1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fig.\u00a01</figureref>\n ).

Using an in situ deployment, however, such a solution does not provide performance guarantees due to unpredictable intermittent connectivity. On the other hand, a solution that tries to cover every point in an entire road network with APs (a full coverage) is not very practical due to prohibitive deployment and operational costs. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of intermittent coverage for mobile users, called Alpha Coverage, which provides worst-case guarantees on the interconnection gap, i.e., the distance or expected delay between two consecutive mobile-AP contacts for a vehicle, while using significantly fewer APs than needed for full coverage. We propose efficient algorithms to verify whether a given deployment provides Alpha Coverage. The problem of finding an economic deployment that provides \u03b1 -coverage turns out to be NP-hard. We hence provide both approximation algorithms that have provable guarantees on the performance as well as efficient heuristics that perform well in practice. The efficiency of our algorithms is demonstrated via simulations using data from real-world road networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2170218","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6216496/06043884.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2170218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6216496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse WiFi Deployment for Vehicular Internet Access With Bounded Interconnection Gap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sparse WiFi Deployment for Vehicular Internet Access With Bounded Interconnection Gap","volume":"20","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12786484","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043884/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043884/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse WiFi Deployment for Vehicular Internet Access With Bounded Interconnection Gap","sourcePdf":"tnet-zheng-2170218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132443S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6216496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6216496","articleId":"6043884","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6043893,"authors":[{"name":"M\u00e9lanie Raine","affiliation":["DAM, DIF, CEA, Arpajon, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9lanie","lastName":"Raine","id":"37540551800"},{"name":"Guillaume Hubert","affiliation":["ONERA, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Hubert","id":"37283251600"},{"name":"Marc Gaillardin","affiliation":["DAM, DIF, CEA, Arpajon, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Gaillardin","id":"37428401600"},{"name":"Philippe Paillet","affiliation":["DAM, DIF, CEA, Arpajon, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Paillet","id":"37283486900"},{"name":"Arnaud Bournel","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique Fondamentale, CNRS, University Paris Sud (UMR 8622), Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Bournel","id":"37274734600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6043893","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":556},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM chips","Topology","Sensitivity","Ions","Single event upset","Monte Carlo methods","Silicon on insulator technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ion beam effects","Monte Carlo methods","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo prediction","Heavy ion Induced MBU sensitivity","SOI SRAMs","simulation methodology","coupling radial ionization profiles","Geant4","SEE prediction tool","single event effects","MUSCA SEP3","SOI SRAM cells","MBU probability","data pattern","high LET ion","grazing angle","three-bit events","four-bit events","cells topology","hardening strategies","device hardness","size 45 nm","size 32 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MBU","SRAM cell","Monte Carlo","SEU prediction tool","Geant4"]}],"abstract":"The simulation methodology coupling radial ionization profiles issued from Geant4 and the SEE prediction tool MUSCA SEP\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n is used to investigate the MBU sensitivity of SOI SRAM cells of different technologies.

Due to the fast computational capabilities of the proposed algorithm, it is envisioned that it becomes an operations tool for both the generation companies and the TSO/ISO. The methodology proposed improves the overall search capability of two powerful heuristic optimization algorithms: a special class of ant colony optimization called API and a real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA). The proposed algorithm, entitled GAAPI, is a relatively simple but robust algorithm, which combines the downhill behavior of API (a key characteristic of optimization algorithms) and a good spreading in the solution space of the GA search strategy (a guarantee to avoid being trapped in local optima). The feasibility of the proposed method is first tested on a number of well-known complex test functions, as well as on four different power test systems having different sizes and complexities. The results are analyzed in terms of both quality of the solution and the computational efficiency; it is shown that the proposed GAAPI algorithm is capable of obtaining highly robust, quality solutions in a reasonable computational time, compared to a number of similar algorithms proposed in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/06043898.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2168833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2168833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GA-API Solution for the Economic Dispatch of Generation in Power System Operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Valves","Spinning","Generators","Power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","genetic algorithms","power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GA-API solution","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power system operation","computational capabilities","real coded genetic algorithm","RCGA","ant colony optimization","API","TSO-ISO","GA search strategy","power test as systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["API","ant colony optimization","economic dispatch","genetic algorithm","global optimization","hybrid models","nonconvex optimization","power system operation","robust search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A GA-API Solution for the Economic Dispatch of Generation in Power System Operation","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6043898/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12486413","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GA-API Solution for the Economic Dispatch of Generation in Power System Operation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-kyriakides-2168833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095439S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"6043898","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6043905,"authors":[{"name":"Mulinti Sivarama Krishna","affiliation":["Department of Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6051730/6043905/6043905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mulinti Sivarama Krishna (M'11) received the M.Tech. degree from JNTU, Hyderabad, India.

The FOE is a circuit element similar to resistance, capacitance, and inductance generally used in electrical network. The specifications of integer order elements, i.e., inductance, resistance, and capacitance, are defined by the magnitude only as their exponents are of fixed value, namely, - 1, 0, and +1, respectively. The specialty of FOE is that both its magnitude and exponent value have to be defined, where the value of the exponent dictates the behavior. This paper elaborately discusses the methodology of realizing a fractional order capacitor named here as FOE (or, in general, FOE). It has been found that a FOE can be realized by dipping a capacitive-type probe, coated with a porous film of polymer of particular thickness, into a polarizable medium. The thickness, uniformity, and stability of the porous film, on the electrode, are responsible for different exponent values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"58","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12301523","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6043905/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication of a Fractional Order Capacitor With Desired Specifications: A Study on Process Identification and Characterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication of a Fractional Order Capacitor With Desired Specifications: A Study on Process Identification and Characterization","sourcePdf":"ted-sivaramakrishna-2166763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073209S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6051730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6051730","articleId":"6043905","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6043909,"authors":[{"name":"Xuena Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6170997/6043909/6043909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuena Bao received the B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, the M.Eng. degree in engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan, through a double-degree program, in 2008, and the M.Sc. degree in engineering from Waseda University in 2010.

To achieve high ME quality for hierarchical motion search, we propose an advanced hierarchical ME scheme which processes the multiresolution motion search with an efficient refining stage. This enables high data and hardware reuse for much lower bandwidth and memory cost, while achieving higher ME quality than previous works. In addition, a lossless frame recompression scheme based on this ME algorithm is presented to further reduce bandwidth. A hierarchical memory organization as well as a leveling two-step data fetching strategy is applied to meet constraint of random access for hierarchical motion search structure. Also, the leveling compression strategy by allowing a lower level to refer to a higher one for compression is proposed to efficiently reduce the bandwidth. Furthermore, an early-level termination method suitable for hierarchical ME structure is also applied. This method terminates high-level redundant motion searches by establishing thresholds based on current block mode and motion search level; it also applies the early refinement termination in order to avoid unnecessary refinement for high levels. Experimental results show that the total scheme has a much lower bit rate increasing compared with previous works especially for high motion sequences, while achieving a considerable saving of memory and bandwidth cost for large SR of [-128,127].","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2171677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6170997/06043909.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2171677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170997","startPage":"237","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Advanced Hierarchical Motion Estimation Scheme With Lossless Frame Recompression and Early-Level Termination for Beyond High-Definition Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Advanced Hierarchical Motion Estimation Scheme With Lossless Frame Recompression and Early-Level Termination for Beyond High-Definition Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615276","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6043909/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Advanced Hierarchical Motion Estimation Scheme With Lossless Frame Recompression and Early-Level Termination for Beyond High-Definition Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tmm-bao-2171677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086264S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6170997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6170997","articleId":"6043909","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6043915,"authors":[{"name":"Anatoly Khina","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6043915/6043915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anatoly Khina (S'08) was born in Moscow, Russia, on September 10, 1984.

Unlike orthogonal modulation methods (such as the singular-value decomposition), we allow interference between subchannels, which can be removed by the receivers via successive cancellation. The degrees of freedom earned by this relaxation are used for obtaining a basis, and corresponding decomposition, which are simultaneously good for more than one link. Specifically, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for shaping the ratio vector of subchannel gains of two broadcast-channel receivers. We then apply this decomposition to two scenarios: First, in digital multicasting we present a practical capacity-achieving scheme which uses only scalar codes and linear processing. Then, we consider the joint source-channel problem of transmitting a Gaussian source over a two-user multiple-input multiple-output channel, where we show the existence of nontrivial cases, where the optimal distortion pair (which for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) equals the optimal point-to-point distortions of the individual users) may be achieved by employing a hybrid digital-analog scheme over the induced equivalent channel. These scenarios demonstrate the advantage of choosing a modulation basis based upon multiple links in the network. Thus, we coin the approach \u201cnetwork modulation\u201d.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2171684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06043915.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2171684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Unitary Triangularization for MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043915/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Unitary Triangularization for MIMO Networks","volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425251","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043915/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Unitary Triangularization for MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-kochman-2171684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094962S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6043915","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6043916,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Clarke","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6043916/6043916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Clarke (S'09) received the M.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of York, York, U.K., where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics.","His research interests include adaptive signal processing and cooperative communications."]},"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37283716900"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6043916/6043916-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo C. de Lamare (S'99\u2013M'04\u2013SM'10) received the Diploma degree in electronic engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Since January 2006, he has been with the Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, U.K., where he is currently a Senior Lecturer in communications engineering.

Set-membership filtering is applied to the design and adaptation of the dimensionality-reducing projection matrix and the reduced-rank interference suppression filter. The specification of error bounds on the projection matrix and reduced-rank filter lead to the formation of two constraint sets from which estimates of the adaptive structures are selected at each time instant. The result is a low-complexity sparsely updating reduced-rank technique that does not require eigendecomposition or subspace tracking procedures. We develop least squares and stochastic gradient-type algorithms and a low-complexity rank-selection algorithm and also devise a time-varying adaptive error bound implementation. We present a stability and mean-square-error convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms along with a study of their complexity. The proposed schemes are applied to interference suppression in the uplink of a multiuser spread-spectrum DS-CDMA system, and the results confirm the validity of the analysis and the effective operation of the schemes. Performance comparisons are given against existing reduced-rank and full-rank algorithms, which act to highlight the improvements obtained by the proposed technique and algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2171376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06043916.pdf","startPage":"4324","endPage":"4337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2171376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Reduced-Rank Linear Interference Suppression Based on Set-Membership Joint Iterative Optimization for DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6043916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043916/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Reduced-Rank Linear Interference Suppression Based on Set-Membership Joint Iterative Optimization for DS-CDMA Systems","volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408172","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6043916/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Reduced-Rank Linear Interference Suppression Based on Set-Membership Joint Iterative Optimization for DS-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-clarke-2171376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125585S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6043916","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6043917,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311071400"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6043917","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Decoding","OFDM","Complexity theory","Channel estimation","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","channel coding","channel estimation","communication complexity","fading channels","interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","space division multiple access","time-varying channels","time-varying filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDMA-OFDM","multiple symbol filtering","multiple symbol differential spatial division multiple access","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","bandwidth efficiency application","time varying fading channel decoder","channel estimation","low complexity adaptive multiple symbol differential interference suppression","maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","multiple symbol differential sphere detection","DIS receiver design","MS-DSDMA system","DIS filter bank","MSDSD","extrinsic information transfer chart analysis","Monte-Carlo-based simulation","turbo DIS scheme","linear minimum mean squared error-based adaptive receiver","complexity reduction technique","iterative detection complexity","LMMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","differential modulation","interference suppression","MIMO","multiple-symbol differential detection","SDMA-OFDM","sphere decoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multiple-symbol differential spatial division multiple-access (MS-DSDMA) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system conceived for low-complexity and high-bandwidth-efficiency applications operating in time-varying fading channels, where no channel estimation is required.

Both the EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and the Monte-Carlo-based simulation results show that the proposed three-stage turbo DIS scheme is capable of achieving a substantially enhanced performance in comparison with the conventional linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE)-based adaptive receiver.

Our goal is to exploit both economic and performance benefits. To achieve a cost-effective deployment and meet long-term performance requirements, this paper addresses the issue of dimensioning and site planning (DSP). We provide a complete formulation to capture the challenges behind network deployment. A number of long-term design subjects are jointly considered in a unified optimization framework, including infrastructure placement, base station user allocation, and resource breakdown assignment. To reduce the computation complexity, the DSP problem is decomposed into two subproblems. An approach is further developed to reformulate the problem into a solvable mixed integer linear program. Moreover, we conduct case studies to validate the formulation, in which performance gains are demonstrated in terms of total infrastructure cost reduction, spectral efficiency improvement, and scalability in capacity enhancement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6043918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408174","htmlLink":"/document/6043918/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dimensioning and Site Planning of Integrated PON and Wireless Cooperative Networks for Fixed Mobile Convergence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensioning and Site Planning of Integrated PON and Wireless Cooperative Networks for Fixed Mobile Convergence","sourcePdf":"tvt-ho-2171432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084714S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6043918","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6043978,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-jie Wang","affiliation":["College of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Jun-jie","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Sen Mu","affiliation":["College of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Mu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-491-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-490-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-489-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9430"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9449"}],"articleNumber":"6043978","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2713},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["World Wide Web","Microcomputers","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security issue","security countermeasures","cloud computing","information security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","security issues","countermeasures"]}],"abstract":"As an emerging technology, cloud computing has attracted more attention.

Also, the VPT produces about 60% and 30% more gross dies per wafer than conventional 8F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 6F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n cells.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2011.6044197","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034694/6044153/06044197.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2011.6044197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel 4F<sup>2</sup> DRAM cell with Vertical Pillar Transistor(VPT)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel 4F<sup>2</sup> DRAM cell with Vertical Pillar Transistor(VPT)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306012","htmlLink":"/document/6044197/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel 4F<sup>2</sup> DRAM cell with Vertical Pillar Transistor(VPT)","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"D049B3LC55043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055404S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034694","isNumber":"6044153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034694","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6044153","articleId":"6044197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044198,"authors":[{"name":"Yimao Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yimao","lastName":"Cai","id":"37535484200"},{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279335000"},{"name":"Ru Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Huang","id":"37273463400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0708-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0707-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0706-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1930-8876"}],"articleNumber":"6044198","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Junctions","Flash memory","Programming","Reliability","Boron","Logic gates","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doping profiles","flash memories","ion implantation","semiconductor doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["counter-lightly-doped-drain structure","multilevel cell NOR flash memory","drain disturb reduction","counter lightly doped drain implantation","floating gate flash process","flash cell","drain junction doping profile","endurance reliability"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new structure with counter lightly doped drain (C-LDD) implantation for Multi-level cell (MLC) NOR flash memory application, aimed at reducing drain disturb. The manufacturing of C-LDD cell is fully compatible with standard floating gate flash process and no extra mask is required. Experimental results show that, by introducing C-LDD structure, the drain disturb can be successfully inhibited compared with conventional flash cell due to the optimization of drain junction doping profile. Endurance reliability is also improved when C-LDD is adopted. In addition, experiments reveal that no program degradation is observed when applying C-LDD implantation. These advantages have shown that C-LDD structure is a low cost and effective way to obtain high reliability in NOR flash memory.","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034694/6044153/06044198.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2011.6044198","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2011.6044198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counter-lightly-doped-drain (C-LDD) structure for Multi-level cell (MLC) NOR flash memory free of drain disturb","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Counter-lightly-doped-drain (C-LDD) structure for Multi-level cell (MLC) NOR flash memory free of drain disturb","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044198/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044198/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counter-lightly-doped-drain (C-LDD) structure for Multi-level cell (MLC) NOR flash memory free of drain disturb","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"D048B3LC45266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088583S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034694","isNumber":"6044153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034694","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044153","articleId":"6044198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044205,"authors":[{"name":"Lucio Pancheri","affiliation":["Integrated Optical Sensors and Interfaces, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Pancheri","id":"37282907500"},{"name":"David Stoppa","affiliation":["Integrated Optical Sensors and Interfaces, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Stoppa","id":"37268553400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0708-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0707-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0706-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1930-8876"}],"articleNumber":"6044205","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":915},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology","Junctions","Photonics","Temperature measurement","Detectors","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche diodes","CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise","single photon avalanche diodes","CMOS technology","monolithically integrated circuit","passive quenching circuit","fast comparator","size 0.15 mum"]}],"abstract":"Two different Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) structures in a standard 0.15-nm CMOS technology are presented.

The bursty characteristics of the video traffic make it difficult to fulfill the requirements for Quality of Services (QoS) of such applications. Among other procedures for traffic and congestion control bandwidth allocation is also one of the options to guarantee the specified QoS. Dynamic bandwidth allocation can be successfully performed with the use of traffic prediction. Neural networks are a vastly used tool for prediction. The multi-step ahead prediction is more difficult approach then the single-step ahead prediction, but because video time series include long-range time dependencies, the multi-step ahead prediction seems as a better approach to video traffic prediction. In this paper we present three different approaches to multi-step ahead prediction and compare the results. First we describe basic principles of two types of neural networks, which we use for all the three approaches: the multilayer perceptron and the Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogeneous inputs neural network (NARX). Then we briefly describe the composition of the video trace files. In the last section we present the results for multi-step ahead video prediction.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034696/6044246/06044279.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2011","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-step ahead prediction using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-step ahead prediction using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12306215","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044279/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-step ahead prediction using neural networks","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"070origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046994S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034696","isNumber":"6044246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034696","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044246","articleId":"6044279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ELMAR (Electronics in Marines)","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6044337,"authors":[{"name":"Jozef Ban","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Jozef","lastName":"Ban","id":"37902744000"},{"name":"Matej F\u00e9der","affiliation":["Department of Applied Informatics and Information Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Matej","lastName":"F\u00e9der","id":"37903645700"},{"name":"Milo\u0161 Oravec","affiliation":["Department of Applied Informatics and Information Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Milo\u0161","lastName":"Oravec","id":"37323010300"},{"name":"Jarmila Pavlovi\u010dov\u00e1","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Jarmila","lastName":"Pavlovi\u010dov\u00e1","id":"37322996800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-7044-12-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-949-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"6044337","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"This paper deals with one sample per person face recognition, also called one sample per person problem.

It relies on properties such as incoherence, signal sparsity and compressibility, and does not follow traditional acquisition process based on transform coding. Sensing procedure is very simple, nonadaptive method that employs linear projections of signal onto test functions. Set of test functions is arranged in the measurement matrix that allows acquiring random samples of original signal. Signal reconstruction is achieved from small amount of data by an optimization process which has the aim to find the sparsest vector with transform coefficients among all possible solutions.

Reconstruction process was presented on a few types of signals at the end of this paper.

Compared to UAVs used by the military, civilian UAVs are often operated by pilots without formal training, and hence they require increased levels of autonomy and intelligence, especially with regard to reducing threats to public safety. UAV integration into the National Air Space will require that the UAVs support multiple, complementary sense-and-avoid mechanisms, including detection and identification of other UAV-sized targets. Currently, the majority of available sensors are based on infrared detectors, focal plane arrays, optical and ultrasonic rangefinders. These sensors are generally not able to detect or identify other UAV-sized targets and, when detection is possible, considerable computational power may be required for successful identification. By contrast, this paper describes the design of a light weight, X-Band (10.5GHz) radar system for use on a small-scale (<; 25 kg) rotorcraft. The prototype radar implementation is small enough to be carried by any miniature UAV, and it is capable of differentiating other miniature rotorcraft by their doppler signature. In addition to the overall hardware and software design of the prototype system, a performance analysis of various signature matching algorithms is presented demonstrating the capabilities of the system in a laboratory setting.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044363","startPage":"933","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044363.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044363","endPage":"940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar-based detection and identification for miniature air vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Radar-based detection and identification for miniature air vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044363/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12305683","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar-based detection and identification for miniature air vehicles","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050744S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":6044369,"authors":[{"name":"Osamu Kaneko","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37276991200"},{"name":"Yusuke Wadagaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Wadagaki","id":"37887833700"},{"name":"Hien Thi Nguyen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hien Thi","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37897368600"},{"name":"Shigeru Yamamoto","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37276830100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1063-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1062-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1061-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6044369","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Tuning","Transfer functions","Optimization","Adaptive control","Minimization","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","feedback","iterative methods","poles and zeros","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fictitious reference iterative tuning","time-delay","internal model control architecture","controller parameter tuning","unstable zeros","FRIT","IMC","parametrized feedback controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044369","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044369.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fictitious reference iterative tuning for a system with a time-delay and/or unstable zeros in the internal model control architecture","abstract":"As one of the interesting and meaningful applications of a controller parameter tuning, this paper proposes a simultaneous attainment of both of a desired controller and a mathematical model of a plant in the internal model control (IMC) architecture.

For the purpose of the simultaneous attainment of a controller and a model of the plant, we introduce a specific structure of the feedback controller with a tunable parameter in IMC. And then, we utilize the fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT), which is a useful controller parameter tuning with only one-shot experimental data, for the tuning of the parametrized feedback controller and the parameterized internal model. In addition, we explain how the utilization of FRIT and the proposed structure on the feedback controller are effective for obtaining not only the desired control parameter but also an appropriate mathematical model of the plant.

The feedback loop which is designed via characteristic loci method (CLM) is then augmented with a DOB containing a parameterized low-pass filter. According to the disturbance rejection, sensitivity reduction, and noise rejection of the whole controller, three performance indices are defined which enable us to pick the filter's optimal parameters using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Finally, experimental results show desirable improvement in stiffness and disturbance rejection of the proposed controller as well as its robust stability.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044382","startPage":"376","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044382.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal multivariable two-degree-of-freedom control of electric wheelchair using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low pass filters","Approximation methods","Control systems","Uncertainty","Brushless DC motors","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","feedback","genetic algorithms","handicapped aids","low-pass filters","medical control systems","mobile robots","multivariable control systems","observers","optimal control","robust control","wheelchairs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multivariable two-degree-of-freedom control","electric wheelchair","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","disturbance observer","sensitivity reduction","feedback loop","characteristic loci method","parameterized low-pass filter","disturbance rejection","noise rejection","multiobjective optimization","robust stability","mobility-impaired patients","elderly patients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal multivariable two-degree-of-freedom control of electric wheelchair using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305702","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal multivariable two-degree-of-freedom control of electric wheelchair using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115744S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044387,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey A.

In previous work [1], we introduced the adaptive-delay algorithm that improved the tracking performance of the feedforward plant-injection architecture. The key benefit of the adaptive-delay algorithm is the adaptation calculation that does not require knowledge of plant parameters. In [1], the algorithm uses model-inverse-based feedforward control to increase raster-tracking bandwidth. It is well known that model-inverse-based feedforward control designs can perform poorly in the presence of large model variation or uncertainty. System identification methods reveal that the frequency response of our piezoscanner includes a large amount of variation as the user requests various operating points within the stage's range. As a result, tracking performance degrades as we vary from the conditions with which the model was identified. To correct for this, we combined the adaptive-delay algorithm with partial-parameter adaptation that updates critically variant parameters. This partnership of adaptive feedforward controllers improved experimental tracking results and robustness to model uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044387","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044387.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-adaptive feedforward control for raster tracking with applications to AFMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044387/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-adaptive feedforward control for raster tracking with applications to AFMs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305707","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044387/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-adaptive feedforward control for raster tracking with applications to AFMs","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05222S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044401,"authors":[{"name":"Sourabh Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Sourabh","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37275362500"},{"name":"Ali Khanafer","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Khanafer","id":"37712643700"},{"name":"Tamer Ba\u015far","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ba\u015far","id":"37269539100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1063-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1062-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1061-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6044401","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044401","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Jamming","Modulation","Interference","Antenna radiation patterns","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential games","jamming","mobile ad hoc networks","remotely operated vehicles","telecommunication security","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal communication strategies","switching behavior","team jamming games","resource constraints","malicious intrusion","autonomous vehicles","wireless ad hoc networks","zero sum differential game","Isaacs approach","optimal trajectories","zero sum matrix game","adaptive modulation problem","continuous kernel game","power control","pure strategy saddle point equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the issue of malicious intrusion in the communication network present in a team of autonomous vehicles. In our current scenario, we consider the special case of two teams with each team consisting of two mobile agents. Agents belonging to the same team communicate over wireless ad hoc networks, and they try to split their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. Contrary to our earlier work, this paper addresses the scenario in which each player has an omni-directional antenna for jamming the communication between the members of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function adopted is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the problem as a zero-sum differential game between the two teams and use Isaacs' approach to obtain the necessary conditions for the optimal trajectories. We model the adaptive modulation problem as a zero-sum matrix game which in turn gives rise to a continuous kernel game to handle power control. Based on the communications model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the existence of a pure strategy saddle-point equilibrium (PSSPE). This leads to a switching behavior in the optimal communication strategy within a team, over the time horizon of the entire game. This behavior is illustrated in our simulations for the case when the agents are holonomic.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044401","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044401.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1237","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching behavior in optimal communication strategies for team jamming games under resource constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Switching behavior in optimal communication strategies for team jamming games under resource constraints","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305721","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching behavior in optimal communication strategies for team jamming games under resource constraints","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063569S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6044436,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Igarashi","affiliation":["Department Electronical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Denki University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Igarashi","id":"37282994800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1063-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1062-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1061-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6044436","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Target tracking","Neural networks","Man machine systems","Mobile communication","Predictive models","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences","neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human skill evaluation","operation input characteristics","multiple neural networks","mobile object","time series","mobile target"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044436","abstract":"This paper addresses a human skill evaluation technique with characteristics of input command decision during operation tasks of a mobile object.

That makes it an important manufacturing technology serving a wide variety of markets. Though the performance criteria imposed by today's applications are quite tight already, the future performance requirements will be even more challenging. However, the attainable performance is limited by two operational issues that are generally encountered, namely residual vibrations and cross-talk. This paper presents an approach based on a MIMO Model Predictive Control (MPC) with which the input waveform is designed to improve the printing quality of a piezoelectric inkjet printer. The narrow-gap model is employed to predict the response of the ink channel under the application of the piezo input. Simulation and experimental results are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044444.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"387","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the printing quality of an inkjet printhead using MIMO model predictive control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ink","MIMO","Printing","Predictive models","Vibrations","Predictive control","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","predictive control","printing industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printing quality","inkjet printhead","MIMO model predictive control","drop-on-demand inkjet printing","manufacturing technology","MPC","piezoelectric inkjet printer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving the printing quality of an inkjet printhead using MIMO model predictive control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305762","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the printing quality of an inkjet printhead using MIMO model predictive control","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056319S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044449,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zeng","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37890768600"},{"name":"Bin Xian","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xian","id":"37282816500"},{"name":"Chen Diao","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Diao","id":"37544296900"},{"name":"Qiang Yin","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37892431800"},{"name":"Haotao Li","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Haotao","lastName":"Li","id":"37900525900"},{"name":"Yungao Yang","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yungao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1063-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1062-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1061-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6044449","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":568},"abstract":"In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive regulation controller is presented for a class of underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Moreover, a laser interferometer sensing system is implemented to improve the positioning resolution of the stage. To maintain stability and robustness of the precision system, a decentralized adaptive sliding mode controller (DASMC) was implemented to overcome the overall situations of unmodeled system dynamics and external noises.

Automatic control of the wings is a key aspect of HAWE generators and it is a complex issue, since the system at hand is open-loop unstable, difficult to model and subject to significant external disturbances. In this paper, a control technique for HAWE generators is proposed, based on a Direct-Inverse Control approach, that allows to compute a controller directly from data, thus avoiding the need to derive a model of the system. The Direct-Inverse controller is designed by using a sparse identification method, and its effectiveness in the considered application is shown through numerical simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044468","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044468.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct data-driven inverse control of a power kite for high altitude wind energy conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Direct data-driven inverse control of a power kite for high altitude wind energy conversion","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044468/","accessionNumber":"12305786","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044468/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct data-driven inverse control of a power kite for high altitude wind energy conversion","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065108S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044515,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan M.

In this paper, the relatively new smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is used for the training of a nonlinear multilayered feed forward network. The SVSF is a recursive sliding mode parameter and state estimator that has a predictor-corrector form. Using a switching gain, a corrective term is calculated to force the network weights to converge to within a neighbourhood of the optimal weight values. SVSF-based trained neural networks are used to classify engine faults on the basis of vibration data. Two faults are induced in a four-stroke, eight-cylinder engine. Furthermore, a comparative study between the popular back propagation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the SVSF is presented. Experimental results indicate that the SVSF is comparable with the EKF, and both methods outperform back propagation.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2011.6044515","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1196","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2011.6044515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044349","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034545/6044349/06044515.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection of an engine using a neural network trained by the smooth variable structure filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044515/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault detection of an engine using a neural network trained by the smooth variable structure filter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044515/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12305833","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection of an engine using a neural network trained by the smooth variable structure filter","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113735S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034545","isNumber":"6044349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6044349","articleId":"6044515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6044536,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang Ki Kevin Kim","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kwang Ki Kevin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37899542300"},{"name":"Ernesto R\u00edos Patr\u00f3n","affiliation":["Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos and Facultad de Quimica, UNAM, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ernesto R\u00edos","lastName":"Patr\u00f3n","id":"38245562500"},{"name":"Richard D.

Several efforts have demonstrated that by vertical integration, memory proximity and bandwidth are improved using efficient communication with low-complexity 2-D arrays. However, power delivery and cooling do not allow integration of multiple layers with dense logic elements. Interlayer cooled 3-D chip stacks solve the cooling bottlenecks, thereby allowing stacking of several such stacks, but are still limited by power delivery and communication. Electrochemical power delivery eliminates the electrical power supply network, freeing valuable space for communication, and allows scaling of chip stacks to larger systems beyond exascale device count and performance. We find that historical efficiency trends are related to density and that current transistors are small enough for zetascale systems once communication and supply networks are simultaneously optimized. We infer that biological efficiencies for information processing can be reached by 2060 with ultracompact space-filled systems that make use of brain-inspired packaging and allometric scaling laws.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2011","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward five-dimensional scaling: How density improves efficiency in future computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward five-dimensional scaling: How density improves efficiency in future computers","sourcePdf":"jrd-ruch-2165677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040093S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6032764","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"31","articleId":"6044603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6044664,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Il Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Il","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183930100"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Jun Heo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Heo","id":"37306786300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6044664","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":853},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Analytical models","Protocols","AWGN","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","interference (signal)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","amplify-and-forward partial relay selection","multiple interferers","AF partial relay selection","interference-limited environment","multicell environment","wireless network","cooperative AF relaying","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying","opportunistic relaying","multiple interferers","outage probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044664","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100611.110441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100611.110441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06044664.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Partial Relay Selection Scheme with Multiple Interferers","abstract":"In this letter, the exact form of the outage probability for opportunistic amplify-and-forward (AF) partial relay selection scheme in interference-limited environment is derived.

Simulation results show that the new technique can effectively increase the sum capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity MIMO Scheduling with Block Diagonalization Using Capacity Lower-Bound","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100611.111249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06044667.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100611.111249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity MIMO Scheduling with Block Diagonalization Using Capacity Lower-Bound","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6044667/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425073","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity MIMO Scheduling with Block Diagonalization Using Capacity Lower-Bound","sourcePdf":"1298-cl1112-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060603S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6104419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"6104419","articleId":"6044667","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044670,"authors":[{"name":"Fangqin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37895711800"},{"name":"Chuang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6044670","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Fading channels","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Closed-form solutions","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["losses","protocols","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet loss prediction","bursty wireless channel","closed form solution","packet loss rate","channel dynamics","cross layer protocols","wireless network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bursty wireless channels","packet loss rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044670","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06044670.pdf","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100511.111663","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.100511.111663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Method to Predict Packet Losses over Bursty Wireless Channels","abstract":"In this letter, we perform an analytical investigation of packet losses for bursty wireless channels and present a closed-form solution for the packet loss rate.

In many cases, particularly extended reach PONs which may cover distances of 100 km or more [1], there is the need for low cost reach extension technologies. Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs) have a key role in this context, particularly because upstream traffic is commonly carried at 1.3 \u03bcm. Upstream traffic in a PON (from the Optical Network Unit, ONU to the Optical Line Terminal, OLT) is normally Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) with a wide variation in path loss arising from differences in transmission distances and splitting losses. The bursty nature of this traffic combined with a wide dynamic range of signal strength ( -15 dBm to -28 dBm-the difference between a very close ONU with a small split ratio and a distant ONU with a high split ratio), places severe demands on the burst mode receiver at the OLT. Conventional fibre amplifiers cannot adjust their gain with packet to packet variations due to their response time. Similarly, conventional SOAs suffer loss of linearity if their bias current and hence gain is rapidly reduced. The paper reports on an adjustable gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifier (AGC-SOA) designed to maximize the output saturated power while adjusting gain to regulate power differences between packets without loss of linearity. Theoretical modeling predicts that this device is able to modulate gain at nanosecond rates. The analysis is validated experimentally.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2171669","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6058664/06044689.pdf","startPage":"3483","endPage":"3489","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2171669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Dynamic Gain Modulation Performance of Adjustable Gain-Clamped Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (AGC-SOA)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Dynamic Gain Modulation Performance of Adjustable Gain-Clamped Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (AGC-SOA)","volume":"29","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/6044689/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12375711","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dynamic Gain Modulation Performance of Adjustable Gain-Clamped Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (AGC-SOA)","sourcePdf":"jlt-liu-2171669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048312S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6058664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6058664","articleId":"6044689","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6044691,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Fachin","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6075219/6044691/6044691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Fachin received the B.Sc. degree in aerospace engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in space engineering jointly from the Politecnico di Milano and the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2011.","He is with the Technology Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Structures, MIT.

Simultaneous multiphysics (chemical and mechanical) and multiscale (several orders of magnitude in size) isolation of bioparticles using microfluidic devices with nanoporous elements is demonstrated as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Bulk Nanoporous Elements in Microfluidic Devices With Application to Biomedical Diagnostics","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2167669","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/6075219/06044691.pdf","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2167669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Bulk Nanoporous Elements in Microfluidic Devices With Application to Biomedical Diagnostics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6044691/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12384959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Bulk Nanoporous Elements in Microfluidic Devices With Application to Biomedical Diagnostics","sourcePdf":"jmems-fachin-2167669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11917S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"6075219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6075219","articleId":"6044691","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6044702,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

In this letter, we discuss spectral defragmentation in flexible bandwidth networks using four-wave mixing (FWM) and wavelength selective switch (WSS)-based wavelength conversion blocks. Simulations show a defragmentation degree of one (i.e., the number of defragmentation blocks equals one) results in 71% and 47% reductions in blocking probability under high offered load (680 Erlangs) and low offered load (220 Erlangs), respectively. Further reductions in blocking probability result from an increased defragmentation degree. Experimental results show spectral defragmentation over 500 GHz of bandwidth for a defragmentation degree of one, validating FWM- and WSS-based spectral defragmentation in flexible bandwidth networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2011","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044702/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12384937","volume":"23","issue":"24","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Spectral Defragmentation in Flexible Bandwidth Optical Networking by FWM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Spectral Defragmentation in Flexible Bandwidth Optical Networking by FWM","sourcePdf":"lpt-geisler-2171933-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043623S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6083492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6083492","articleId":"6044702","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044705,"authors":[{"name":"Leonel Soriano-Equigua","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunications, CICESE Research Center, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Soriano-Equigua","id":"38271131000"},{"name":"Jaime Sanchez-Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunications, CICESE Research Center, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Sanchez-Garcia","id":"38277337600"},{"name":"Jorge Flores-Troncoso","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Autonomous University of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Flores-Troncoso","id":"38273558100"},{"name":"Robert W.

The sampling operation inherent to analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion is inevitably subject to random timing uncertainties. These small timing errors introduce a noise component into the system that degrades the effective resolution of the data converters. Although the effect of sampling jitter on single sine waves is well understood, this classical result cannot be generalized to multitone signals, which are nowadays widely used as information carriers in digital communication systems. In this brief, an approximation for the phase noise of integrated clock sources is used to derive an analytical expression for the jitter noise power spectral density (PSD) of unmodulated multitone signals at the output of an ideal sampler. This result requires only a minimum number of basic system parameters for a quick and accurate estimation of the needed sampling clock quality for data converters used in multicarrier processing. In addition to behavioral simulation, the obtained expression is verified experimentally using a CMOS D/A converter with intentionally jittered sampling clock.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044706/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300823","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Jitter Noise of Sampled Multitone Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jitter Noise of Sampled Multitone Signals","sourcePdf":"tcsii-clara-2164153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040747S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6045691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6045691","articleId":"6044706","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6044707,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Garrido","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Garrido","id":"37424933800"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas Grajal","affiliation":["Department of Signal, Systems and Radiocommunications, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Grajal","id":"37272875700"},{"name":"Oscar Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37270788100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6044707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1108},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Indexes","Hardware","Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Fast Fourier transforms","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit reversal","buffers","multiplexers","registers","hardware fast Fourier transform architectures","radix-2","radix-2k","radix-4","radix-8"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit reversal","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","pipelined architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044707","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6045691/06044707.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2164141","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2164141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Circuits for Bit Reversal","abstract":"This brief presents novel circuits for calculating bit reversal on a series of data.

becoming increasingly clear that mitochondria play an important role in neural function. Recent studies show mitochondrial morphology to be crucial to cellular physiology and synaptic function and a link between mitochondrial defects and neuro-degenerative diseases is strongly suspected. Electron microscopy (EM), with its very high resolution in all three directions, is one of the key tools to look more closely into these issues but the huge amounts of data it produces make automated analysis necessary. State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms designed to operate on natural 2-D images tend to perform poorly when applied to EM data for a number of reasons. First, the sheer size of a typical EM volume renders most modern segmentation schemes intractable. Furthermore, most approaches ignore important shape cues, relying only on local statistics that easily become confused when confronted with noise and textures inherent in the data. Finally, the conventional assumption that strong image gradients always correspond to object boundaries is violated by the clutter of distracting membranes. In this work, we propose an automated graph partitioning scheme that addresses these issues. It reduces the computational complexity by operating on supervoxels instead of voxels, incorporates shape features capable of describing the 3-D shape of the target objects, and learns to recognize the distinctive appearance of true boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to segment mitochondria at a performance level close to that of a human annotator, and outperforms a state-of-the-art 3-D segmentation technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Shape","Feature extraction","Three dimensional displays","Image edge detection","Microscopy","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","computer vision","diseases","focused ion beam technology","image segmentation","medical image processing","scanning electron microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervoxel-based segmentation","mitochondria morphology","EM image stacks","learned shape features","cellular physiology","neuro-degenerative diseases","focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy","automated analysis","state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms","natural 2D images","automated graph partitioning scheme","human annotator","state-of-the-art 3-D segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electron microscopy (EM)","mitochondria","segmentation","shape features","supervoxels"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Anatomy, Cross-Sectional","Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Microscopy, Electron","Mitochondria","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2171705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6142636/06044718.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2171705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervoxel-Based Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Image Stacks With Learned Shape Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supervoxel-Based Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Image Stacks With Learned Shape Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044718/","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044718/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12508942","pubMedId":"21997252","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervoxel-Based Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Image Stacks With Learned Shape Features","sourcePdf":"tmi-smith-2171705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125463S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6142636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6142636","articleId":"6044718","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6044723,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Rabkowski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland","Laboratory of Electrical Energy Conversion, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6044723/6044723-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jacek Rabkowski (M\u201910) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","He joined the Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, as an Assistant Professor in 2005.

A dual-source base-drive unit with a speed-up capacitor consisting of a low- and a high-voltage source is, therefore, proposed in this paper. As a significant base current is required during the conduction state, the driver power consumption is higher than for other semiconductor switches. In the presented solution, the steady-state base current is provided by a low-voltage source and is optimized for low-power losses. On the contrary, a second source with a higher voltage and speed-up capacitor is used in order to improve the switching performance of the device. The proposed driver has experimentally been compared to other standard driver solutions by using a double-pulse circuit and a 2-kW dc/dc boost converter. Switching times of 20 ns at turn-ON and 35 ns at turn-OFF were recorded. Finally, the efficiency of the converter was determined experimentally at various switching frequencies. From power loss measurements at 100-kHz switching frequency using the proposed driver in a 2-kW dc/dc boost converter, it was found that the efficiency was approximately 99.0%. In the same operating point, the driver power consumption was only 0.08% of the rated power.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2171722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06044723.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Loss High-Performance Base-Drive Unit for SiC BJTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044723/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Loss High-Performance Base-Drive Unit for SiC BJTs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12571258","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Loss High-Performance Base-Drive Unit for SiC BJTs","sourcePdf":"tpel-peftitsis-2171722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123589S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6044723","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6044727,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Sardellitti","affiliation":["DIET, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6044727/6044727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Sardellitti received the Dr. Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Italy, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and information engineering from the University of Cassino, Italy, in 2005.","Since 2005, she has been an Appointed Professor of digital communications at the University of Cassino.

However, when implemented over wireless sensor networks, the inherent iterative nature of consensus algorithms may cause a large energy consumption. Hence, to make consensus algorithms really appealing in sensor networks, it is necessary to minimize the energy necessary to reach a consensus, within a given accuracy. We propose a method to optimize the network topology and the power allocation over each active link in order to minimize the energy consumption. We consider two network models: a deterministic model, where the nodes are located arbitrarily but their positions are known, and a random model, where the network topology is modeled as a random geometric graph (RGG). In the first case, we show how to convert the topology optimization problem, which is inherently combinatorial, into a parametric convex problem, solvable with efficient algorithms. In the second case, we optimize the power transmitted by each node, exploiting the asymptotic distributions of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of an RGG. We further show that the optimal power can be found as the solution of a convex problem. The theoretical findings are corroborated with extensive simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425253","htmlLink":"/document/6044727/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Topology Control and Power Allocation for Minimum Energy Consumption in Consensus Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Topology Control and Power Allocation for Minimum Energy Consumption in Consensus Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-sardellitti-2171683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10534S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6044727","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6044728,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Okada","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6044728/6044728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenichi Okada (S'99\u2013M'03) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in communications and computer engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1998, 2000, and 2003, respectively.","From 2000 to 2003, he was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in Kyoto University.

The transceiver has been fabricated in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. It in cludes a receiver with a 17.3-dB conversion gain and less than 8.0-dB noise figure, a transmitter with a 18.3-dB conversion gain, a 9.5-dBm output 1 dB compression point, a 10.9-dBm saturation output power and 8.8-% power added efficiency. The 60-GHz frequency synthesizer is implemented by a combination of a 20-GHz PLL and a 60-GHz quadrature injection-locked oscillator, which achieves a phase noise of -95 dBc/Hz@l MHz-offset at 60 GHz. The transceiver realizes IEEE802.15.3c full-rate wireless communication for all 16QAM/8PSK/QPSK/BPSK modes, and the communication distances with the full data rate using 2.16-GHz bandwidth, measured with an antenna built in the package, are 2.7-m (BPSK/QPSK) and 0.2-m (8PSK/16QAM). The measured maximum data rates are 8 Gb/s in QPSK mode and 11 Gb/s in 16QAM mode over a 5 cm wireless link within a bit error rate (BER) of <;10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n.

The dynamics exhibit a wide range of time scales extending beyond 100 ms neglected in typical silicon models of tonic spiking neurons. Circuit simulations and measurements show transition from tonic spiking to tonic bursting dynamics through variation of a single conductance parameter governing calcium recovery. We similarly demonstrate transition from graded to all-or-none neural excitability in the onset of spiking dynamics through the variation of channel kinetic parameters governing the speed of potassium activation. Other combinations of variations in conductance and channel kinetic parameters give rise to phasic spiking and spike frequency adaptation dynamics.

To consider the trade-off between accuracy and area cost, the ACPE provides varying column information to adjust the accuracy with respect to system requirements. The 16-bit ACPE Booth multiplier with w = 3 reduces 28.9% silicon area with only 0.39 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss when compared with post-truncated (P-T) Booth multiplier. Furthermore, the ACPE Booth multipliers are applied to two-dimensional (2-D) discrete cosine transform (DCT) to evaluate the system performance. Implemented in a TSMC 0.18 CMOS process, the DCT core with ACPE (w = 3) can save 14.3% area cost with only 0.48 dB peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) penalty compared to P-T method.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167275","startPage":"594","endPage":"603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6155677/06044732.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Accuracy Adaptive Conditional-Probability Estimator for Fixed-Width Booth Multipliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A High-Accuracy Adaptive Conditional-Probability Estimator for Fixed-Width Booth Multipliers","volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12556347","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6044732/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Accuracy Adaptive Conditional-Probability Estimator for Fixed-Width Booth Multipliers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2167275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139822S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6155677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6155677","articleId":"6044732","onlineDate":"13 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044733,"authors":[{"name":"Karim M.

Its computational cost, however, is very high, and many techniques for reducing the cost have been researched. This paper describes an approach for real time processing of a mean shift algorithm using an FPGA. In our approach, the image is scanned from top to bottom (or bottom to top), and L lines around the target line are buffered on the FPGA, and the pixels on the target line can be processed efficiently using the buffered pixels. When the pixels are shifted out of the L lines, they are put in queues, and processed afterward. In our circuit, the processing of several pixels is interleaved to hide the delay caused by the long feedback in the mean shift filter. A technique to reduce the number of on-chip memory banks used for storing the L lines is also introduced. The performances of our circuit for 768\u00d7512 pixel images is 50 to 130 fps according to the size of the mean shift filter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044768.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Implementation of the Mean Shift Filter on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Clustering algorithms","System-on-a-chip","Kernel","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","field programmable gate arrays","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean shift filter","FPGA","mean shift algorithm","color image segmentation","buffered pixels","on-chip memory banks","768\u00d7512 pixel images","real time processing","delay","interleaved processing","picture size 512 pixel","picture size 768 pixel","picture size 393216 pixel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mean shift","segmentation","real-time","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Implementation of the Mean Shift Filter on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044768/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12315238","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implementation of the Mean Shift Filter on FPGA","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071139S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044769,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Parandeh-Afshar","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Science Department, Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Parandeh-Afshar","id":"38275029300"},{"name":"Paolo Ienne","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Science Department, Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Ienne","id":"37271141000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044769","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Adders","Delay","Digital signal processing","Pipeline processing","Table lookup","Space exploration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","application specific integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded multipliers","soft multipliers","FPGA","ASIC","arithmetic dominated circuits","DSP blocks","logic blocks architecture","arithmetic circuits","adder tree","parallel multiplier","digital circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","DSP Blosck","Embedded Multiplier","Soft Multiplier"]}],"abstract":"To bridge the gap between FPGAs and ASICs for arithmetic dominated circuits, one key step is to improve multipliers on FPGAs. This is a key feature that FPGA vendors have tried to improve in recent years by embedding ASIC like multipliers in the DSP blocks. However, due to the limited number of DSP blocks in an FPGA, their fixed location and bit-width limitation, efficient soft logic implementation of multipliers is fundamental. This is the reason that FPGA vendors have enhanced the logic blocks architecture to improve certain arithmetic circuits such as adder tree, which is the basic part of a parallel multiplier. This paper has two main contributions: (1) The performance gap between embedded and soft multipliers is measured and the design space is explored and (2) the current performance gap is reduced by employing a number of target specific mapping and arithmetic transformation techniques. For this purpose, a multiplier generator tool is developed and two conventional multiplication techniques are implemented in this tool. We compare our multipliers with the ones that are generated by Altera core generator tool considering a wide range of bit-widths. Therefore, this paper can be used as a reference for the digital circuit designers to choose the right way of implementing multipliers on FPGAs based on their design constraints.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.48","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044769.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.48","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring and Reducing the Performance Gap between Embedded and Soft Multipliers on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measuring and Reducing the Performance Gap between Embedded and Soft Multipliers on FPGAs","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12307111","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044769/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring and Reducing the Performance Gap between Embedded and Soft Multipliers on FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091831S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044770,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Diep Nguyen","affiliation":["LIP (ENSL-CNRS-INRIA-UCBL), Lyon Cedex 07, France"],"firstName":"Hong Diep","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37897369400"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["LIP (ENSL-CNRS-INRIA-UCBL), Lyon Cedex 07, France"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"},{"name":"Thomas B.

The need for fast wide adders grows with the demand for large precisions as, for example, required for the implementation of IEEE-754 quadruple precision and elliptic-curve cryptography. The FPGA realization of fast and compact binary adders relies on hardware carry chains. These provide a natural implementation environment for the ripple-carry addition (RCA) scheme. As its latency grows linearly with operand width, wide additions call for acceleration, which is quite reasonably achieved by addition schemes built from parallel RCA blocks. This study presents FPGA-specific arithmetic optimizations for the mapping of carry-select and carry-increment adders targeting the hardware carry chains of modern FPGAs. Different trade-offs between latency and area are explored. The proposed architectures can be successfully used in the context of latency-critical systems or as attractive alternatives to deeply pipelined RCA schemes.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.49","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044770.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Specific Arithmetic Optimizations of Short-Latency Adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Specific Arithmetic Optimizations of Short-Latency Adders","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044770/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307112","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Specific Arithmetic Optimizations of Short-Latency Adders","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067114S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044771,"authors":[{"name":"Harry Sidiropoulos","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Sidiropoulos","id":"37847776600"},{"name":"Kostas Siozios","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Siozios","id":"37281943000"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37271305000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044771","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","IP networks","Pins","Estimation","Routing","Multiplexing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","memory architecture","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory hierarchy","FPGA devices","NAROUTO open-source tool framework","floor-planning","power-energy evaluation","architecture design"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel methodology for enabling rapid exploration of memory hierarchies onto FPGA devices.

increases. Recent work has proposed Irregular Code Energy Reducers (ICERs), a high-level synthesis approach for FPGAs that offers significant energy reduction for irregular code compared to a soft core processor. ICERs target the hot-spots of programs, and are seamlessly connected via a shared L1 cache with a soft processor that executes the cold code. This paper evaluates the application of the selective depipelining (SDP) technique to ICERs, which greatly reduces both the execution time and energy of irregular computations. SDP enables irregular computations to be expressed as large, fast, low-power combinational blocks. SDP maintains high memory bandwidth by scheduling the many potentially dependent memory operations within these blocks onto a high-frequency, highly-multiplexed coherent memory while scheduling combinational operations at a much lower frequency. SDP is a key enabler for improving the execution properties of irregular computations that are difficult to parallelize. We show that applying SDP to ICERs reduces energy-delay by 2.62\u00d7 relative to ICERs. ICERs with SDP are up to 2.38\u00d7 faster than a soft core processor and reduce energy consumption by up to 15.83\u00d7 for a variety of irregular applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307120","htmlLink":"/document/6044779/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Selective Depipelining for FPGA-Based Energy-Reducing Irregular Code Coprocessors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Selective Depipelining for FPGA-Based Energy-Reducing Irregular Code Coprocessors","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074988S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6044780,"authors":[{"name":"Harry Sidiropoulos","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Sidiropoulos","id":"37847776600"},{"name":"Kostas Siozios","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Siozios","id":"37281943000"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37271305000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044780","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Routing","Integrated circuit interconnections","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architecture-level exploration","communication intensive applications","3D FPGA","interconnection structures","three-dimensional chip stacking","silver bullet technology","Moores momentum","software supporting tools"]}],"abstract":"The interconnection structures in FPGA devices increasingly contribute more to the delay, power consumption and area overhead.

Experimental results shown that such a 3-D architecture is suitable especially for communication intensive applications, since a device with two layers achieves delay reduction, as compared to conventional 2-D FPGAs up to 87% without any overhead in power dissipation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Exploration of Communication Intensive Applications onto 3-D FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.109","startPage":"30","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044780.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Exploration of Communication Intensive Applications onto 3-D FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044780/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307121","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Exploration of Communication Intensive Applications onto 3-D FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048497S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6044782,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Kanazawa","affiliation":["Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Kanazawa","id":"37299279800"},{"name":"Tsutomu Maruyama","affiliation":["Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37291753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044782","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic gates","Delay","Parallel processing","Throughput","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computability","field programmable gate arrays","formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA solver","SAT-encoded formal verification problems","satisfiability problem","memory throughput","memory access delay","operational frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAT","formal verification","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Formal verification is one of the most important applications of the satisfiability (SAT) problem.

Pulsed latches are transparent latches driven by a clock with a non-standard (non-50%) duty cycle. We exploit existing functionality within commercial FPGA chips to implement latch-based optimizations that do not have the power or area drawbacks associated with other timing optimization approaches, such as clock skew and retiming. We propose an algorithm that iteratively replaces certain flip-flops in a logic design with latches for an improvement in circuit speed. Results show that much of the performance improvement achieved by using multiple skewed clocks can also be achieved using a single clock and latches. We also consider the impact of short delay paths (i.e. minimum delays), which can cause hold-time violations. Under conservative minimum delay assumptions, our latch-based optimization, operating on the routed design, provides a 5% performance improvement, on average, essentially for \"free\" (i.e. without any re-routing/delay padding). We show that short paths greatly hinder the ability of using latches for speed improvement, motivating further work to reduce their effects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latch-Based Performance Optimization for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.21","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044785.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Latch-Based Performance Optimization for FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044785/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307125","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latch-Based Performance Optimization for FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060333S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044786,"authors":[{"name":"Subhrashankha Ghosh","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Subhrashankha","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37894045400"},{"name":"Brent Nelson","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37291594100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044786","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Generators","Switches","Adders","Wires","Logic gates","Tiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XDLCoreGen-based module generators","rapid FPGA design implementation","HMFlow","conventional Xilinx tool flow","prebuilt route hard macros","CAD tool contexts","high-level synthesis tools","rapid prototyping flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","CAD","rapid prototyping"]}],"abstract":"XDLCoreGen is described, a module generator framework which directly generates placed and routed hard macros in XDL.

The hardware resources and time overhead needed to perform a partial reconfiguration (PR) can significantly impact overall system cost and performance and must be considered early in the design cycle. Unfortunately, predicting reconfiguration overhead is difficult especially in the presence of non-deterministic factors such as the sharing of resources with traffic not related to the PR process. Thus, current design practices include the measurement of overhead but only after the system has been built thus limiting the number of candidates that can be evaluated. We propose a flexible approach for modeling the PR datapath based on Queueing Theory such that we can estimate performance trends and bottlenecks of the PR process while considering the impact of shared resources. Performance trends are provided for an example system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044787.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Evaluation of Dynamic Partial Reconfigurable Datapaths for FPGA-Based Systems Using Stochastic Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Queueing analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Program processors","Time measurement","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","queueing theory","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic partial reconfigurable datapaths","stochastic networks","FPGA configuration memory","hardware resources","reconfiguration overhead","queueing theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","Partial Reconfiguration","Queueing Theory","Reconfigurable Computing","Modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Evaluation of Dynamic Partial Reconfigurable Datapaths for FPGA-Based Systems Using Stochastic Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307127","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Evaluation of Dynamic Partial Reconfigurable Datapaths for FPGA-Based Systems Using Stochastic Networks","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080734S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044788,"authors":[{"name":"William V.

Existing projects have optimized the routers for low resource utilization, low latency, and high bandwidth, often at the cost of programmability and manageability. Developers using the existing FPGA networks often have no way to specify a source or destination of a message except by using the physical locations of the nodes in the network. This low level of abstraction limits developer productivity and the ability of the network to adapt to changing conditions. We present an FPGA network that resolves these issues by allowing the developer to use familiar 32-bit addresses similar to an IP address and a router that uses a software managed routing table. The implementation presented here demonstrates similar resource utilization and bandwidth with a minimal increase in latency when compared to existing FPGA router implementations.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.24","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Radix Tree Router for Scalable FPGA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Radix Tree Router for Scalable FPGA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044788/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307128","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Radix Tree Router for Scalable FPGA Networks","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047196S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044789,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic, Communication and Information Technology (ECIT), Queens University of Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Lu","id":"37539051400"},{"name":"John McCanny","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic, Communication and Information Technology (ECIT), Queens University of Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McCanny","id":"37276990200"},{"name":"Sakir Sezer","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic, Communication and Information Technology (ECIT), Queens University of Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Sakir","lastName":"Sezer","id":"37265548300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044789","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":856},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Routing","Switches","Table lookup","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generic low-latency packet-switched NoC router architecture","high performance on-chip FPGA computing systems","ASIC technology","low packet propagation latency","router pipeline delay","link traversal delay","network topology","hardware complexity","reconfigurable logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks-on-Chip","FPGA","Router architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044789","abstract":"A novel cost-effective and low-latency wormhole router for packet-switched NoC designs, tailored for FPGA, is presented. This has been designed to be scalable at system level to fully exploit the characteristics and constraints of FPGA based systems, rather than custom ASIC technology. A key feature is that it achieves a low packet propagation latency of only two cycles per hop including both router pipeline delay and link traversal delay - a significant enhancement over existing FPGA designs - whilst being very competitive in terms of performance and hardware complexity. It can also be configured in various network topologies including 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. Detailed design-space exploration has been carried for a range of scaling parameters, with the results of various design trade-offs being presented and discussed. By taking advantage of abundant build-in reconfigurable logic and routing resources, we have been able to create a new scalable on-chip FPGA based router that exhibits high dimensionality and connectivity.

Unlike other state-of-the-art computing platforms, such as General Purpose Processors (GPPs) and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), FPGAs can moreover exploit the applications' requirements with respect to the employed number representation scheme, with the potential to lead to considerable area savings and throughput increases. This work proposes a novel FPGA based architecture for Monte Carlo simulations that monitors and configures the number representation of the system during run-time in order to accommodate the dynamics of the system under investigation, resulting to a considerable boost on the overall performance of the system compared to a conventional system. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, the GARCH model from the financial industry is considered as a case study. The results demonstrate that an average of ~1.35\u00d7 throughput per resource unit improvement is achieved compared to conventional parallel arithmetic implementation.","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044794.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Run-Time Adaptive FPGA Architecture for Monte Carlo Simulations","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.30","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Run-Time Adaptive FPGA Architecture for Monte Carlo Simulations","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307134","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044794/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Run-Time Adaptive FPGA Architecture for Monte Carlo Simulations","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041568S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6044796,"authors":[{"name":"Jocelyn Serot","affiliation":["LASMEA, Universite Blaise Pascal / CNRS, Clermont-Ferrand, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Serot","id":"37594468700"},{"name":"Francois Berry","affiliation":["LASMEA, Universite Blaise Pascal / CNRS, Clermont-Ferrand, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Berry","id":"37339685500"},{"name":"Sameer Ahmed","affiliation":["LASMEA, Universite Blaise Pascal / CNRS, Clermont-Ferrand, France"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37894981300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044796","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Programming","Streaming media","Hardware","Hardware design languages","Computational modeling","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","field programmable gate arrays","pattern matching","program compilers","program interpreters","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stream-processing applications","FPGA","domain-specific language","field programmable gate arrays","actor-dataflow model","unidirectional channels","transition rules","pattern matching","CAPH suite","reference interpreter","compiler","synthetizable VHDL code","real-time motion detection application","smart camera platform"]}],"abstract":"We introduce CAPH, a new domain-specific language (DSL) suited to the implementation of stream-processing applications on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

A PUF needs to be robust against reversible as well as irreversible temporal changes in circuits. While the effect of the reversible temporal changes on PUFs is well studied, it is equally important to analyze the effect of the irreversible temporal changes i.e. aging on PUFs. In this work, we perform an accelerated aging testing on an FPGA-based ring oscillator PUF (RO-PUF) and analyze how it affects the functionality of the PUF. Based on our experiment using a group of 90-nm Xilinx FPGAs, we observe that aging makes PUF responses unreliable. On the other hand, the randomness of PUF responses remains unaffected despite aging.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","High definition video","Stress","Accelerated aging","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","field programmable gate arrays","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical unclonable function","powerful security primitive","irreversible temporal changes","accelerated aging testing","FPGA-based ring oscillator PUF","RO-PUF","Xilinx FPGA","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Function","aging","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044799","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.35","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044799.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.35","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Aging on an FPGA-Based Physical Unclonable Function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Aging on an FPGA-Based Physical Unclonable Function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044799/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044799/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307139","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Aging on an FPGA-Based Physical Unclonable Function","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068397S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044800,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichi Wakaba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Wakaba","id":"37888865000"},{"name":"Masato Inagi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Inagi","id":"37828628200"},{"name":"Shin'ichi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Wakabayashi","id":"37373522600"},{"name":"Shinobu Nagayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Nagayama","id":"37267058500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044800","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Registers","Hardware","Pattern matching","Computer architecture","Clocks","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","computer viruses","control systems","field programmable gate arrays","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient hardware matching engine","nested Kleene operators","systolic pattern-independent hardware regular expression matching engine","virus patterns","network intrusion detection systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","regular expression","NIDS","NFA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a systolic pattern-independent hardware regular expression matching (REM) engine which handles nested Kleene operators used in virus patterns.

However, these approaches result in inefficient memory utilization. Due to the limited amount of on-chip memory of the state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), existing designs cannot support large filter databases arising in backbone routers and intrusion detection systems. Hierarchical search structures for packet classification exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update. However, pipelined hardware implementation of these algorithms suffer from inefficient resource and memory usage due to variation in the size of the trie nodes and backtracking. We propose a memory efficient organization denoted Clustered Hierarchical Search Structure (CHSS) for packet classification. We present a clustering algorithm that partitions a given filter database to reduce the memory requirement. We show that, using the resulting structure, backtracking is not needed to perform a search. We introduce two parameters (NR\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">trie</sub>\n, NR\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tree</sub>\n), which can be chosen based on the given filter database to achieve good memory efficiency. Our algorithm demonstrates substantial reduction in the memory footprint compared with the state-of-the-art. For all publicly available filter databases, the achieved memory efficiency is between 21.54 and 41.25 bytes per rule. We map the proposed data structure onto a linear pipeline architecture to achieve high throughput. Post place and route result using a state-of-the-art FPGA device shows that the design can sustain a throughput of 408 million packets per second, or 130.5 Gbps (for the minimum packet size of 40 Bytes).","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.44","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered Hierarchical Search Structure for Large-Scale Packet Classification on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustered Hierarchical Search Structure for Large-Scale Packet Classification on FPGA","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044809/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307148","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered Hierarchical Search Structure for Large-Scale Packet Classification on FPGA","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078594S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044810,"authors":[{"name":"Lyonel Barthe","affiliation":["LIRMM, UMR 5506, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Lyonel","lastName":"Barthe","id":"37592632700"},{"name":"Luis Vitorio Cargnini","affiliation":["LIRMM, UMR 5506, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Luis Vitorio","lastName":"Cargnini","id":"37298719900"},{"name":"Pascal Benoit","affiliation":["LIRMM, UMR 5506, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37391893000"},{"name":"Lionel Torres","affiliation":["LIRMM, UMR 5506, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Torres","id":"37285662600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044810","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing an Open-Source Processor for FPGAs: A Case Study","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044810.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.107","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Hazards","Pipelines","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","open-source processor","FPGA architectures","register transfer abstraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA-optimized soft-core processor","open-source design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044810","abstract":"Optimizing a processor for FPGA architectures is a challenging task.

It reduced the average dynamic power consumption of this ME hardware by 2.2% with no Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) loss and by 9.3% with 0.04% PSNR loss on a XC2VP30-7 FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.54","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044827.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Power Reduction Technique for Block Matching Motion Estimation Hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044827/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Power Reduction Technique for Block Matching Motion Estimation Hardware","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307153","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044827/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Power Reduction Technique for Block Matching Motion Estimation Hardware","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11094S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6044828,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Hamilton","affiliation":["Claude Shannon Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Coding and Cryptography, Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Hamilton","id":"37589911300"},{"name":"William P.

Considering detailed fault behavior on various circuit elements in a post-layout FPGA application, we develop a simulation-based SEU evaluation tool that quantifies fault contribution for each configuration bit. Using this tool and MCNC benchmark circuits, we study the fault characteristics of FPGA circuits and architectures. We show that interconnects not only contribute to the lion share of functional failures, but also have higher failure rate per configuration bit than LUTs. Particularly, multiplexers in local interconnects have the highest failure rate per bit. We find that tuning LUT and cluster sizes helps to reduce the rate (up to 38% in our experiments). In addition, we evaluate two recent fault mitigation algorithms IPD and IPF, which reduce LUT faults by an average of 74% and 15% respectively. But when interconnects are taken into account, the reduction via IPD which considers only LUT faults is merely 6% on chip level. Yet the reduction via IPF which implicitly considers interconnect faults is still around 15%. Therefore, synthesis algorithm should be evaluated with interconnect faults and future algorithms should be developed with consideration of interconnect faults explicitly.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.57","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044830.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative SEU Fault Evaluation for SRAM-Based FPGA Architectures and Synthesis Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative SEU Fault Evaluation for SRAM-Based FPGA Architectures and Synthesis Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12307156","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044830/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044830/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative SEU Fault Evaluation for SRAM-Based FPGA Architectures and Synthesis Algorithms","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06852S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044833,"authors":[{"name":"Xabier Iturbe","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xabier","lastName":"Iturbe","id":"37397129000"},{"name":"Khaled Benkrid","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Benkrid","id":"37273494800"},{"name":"Tughrul Arslan","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tughrul","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37273392000"},{"name":"Raul Torrego","affiliation":["IKERLAN-IK4 Research Alliance, Embedded System-on-Chip Group, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Torrego","id":"37887682900"},{"name":"Imanol Martinez","affiliation":["IKERLAN-IK4 Research Alliance, Embedded System-on-Chip Group, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Imanol","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37528843100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044833","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods and Mechanisms for Hardware Multitasking: Executing and Synchronizing Fully Relocatable Hardware Tasks in Xilinx FPGAs","abstract":"This paper presents the details of a novel technique which allows for the implementation and execution of completely relocatable hardware tasks onto dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs.

Our approach begins with traditional PathFinder-style routing, which we run on a coarsened representation of the routing architecture. This leads to fast generation of a partial routing solution where signals are assigned to groups of wire segments rather than individual wire segments. A boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based stage follows, generating a legal routing solution from the partial solution.

RapidSmith alleviates several of the difficulties of using XDL and this work demonstrates the kinds of research facilitated by removing such challenges.","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044842.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RapidSmith: Do-It-Yourself CAD Tools for Xilinx FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.69","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"RapidSmith: Do-It-Yourself CAD Tools for Xilinx FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307166","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044842/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RapidSmith: Do-It-Yourself CAD Tools for Xilinx FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100843S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044844,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Llamocca","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Llamocca","id":"37392136200"},{"name":"Cesar Carranza","affiliation":["Secci\u00f3n Electricidad y Electr\u00f3nica, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Carranza","id":"37887694500"},{"name":"Marios Pattichis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Pattichis","id":"37266493300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044844","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Graphics processing unit","Field programmable gate arrays","Accuracy","Filtering algorithms","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separable FIR filtering","FPGA","GPU implementation","digital video processing","hardware resources","dynamic partial reconfiguration","2D FIR filter","2D difference of Gaussians filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","GPU","FIR filter"]}],"abstract":"Digital video processing requires significant hardware resources to achieve acceptable performance.

We also present a high-performance GPU implementation to help understand the trade-offs between these two technologies. Results using a standard example of 2D Difference of Gaussians (DOG) filter indicate that the DPR implementation can deliver real-time performance with energy per frame consumption that is an order of magnitude less than the GPU. On the other hand, at significantly higher energy consumption levels, the GPU implementation can deliver very high performance.","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044844.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separable FIR Filtering in FPGA and GPU Implementations: Energy, Performance, and Accuracy Considerations","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.71","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Separable FIR Filtering in FPGA and GPU Implementations: Energy, Performance, and Accuracy Considerations","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307168","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044844/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separable FIR Filtering in FPGA and GPU Implementations: Energy, Performance, and Accuracy Considerations","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047595S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044846,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail San","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"San","id":"37887686700"},{"name":"Nuray At","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nuray","lastName":"At","id":"37428915000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044846","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"abstract":"Hummingbird is an ultra-lightweight cryptographic algorithm aiming at resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present an enhanced hardware implementation of the Hummingbird cryptographic algorithm that is based on the memory blocks embedded within Spartan-3 FPGAs. The enhancement is not only from the introduction of the coprocessor approach but also from the employment of serialized data processing principles. Due to the compactness of the proposed architecture, remaining reconfigurable area in FPGAs can be used for other purposes. Comparisons to the other reported FPGA implementation of the Hummingbird cryptographic algorithm indicate that the proposed architecture outperforms the previous work in terms of both efficiency and area. We remark that our architecture can also be used as stand-alone although it is built via coprocessor approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044846.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"381","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Hardware Architecture for Hummingbird Cryptographic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Algorithm design and analysis","Encryption","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact hardware architecture","ultralightweight Hummingbird cryptographic algorithm","resource-constrained device","memory block","Spartan-3 FPGA","coprocessor approach","serialized data processing principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hummingbird cryptographic algorithm","lightweight cryptography","coprocessor approach","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compact Hardware Architecture for Hummingbird Cryptographic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307170","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Hardware Architecture for Hummingbird Cryptographic Algorithm","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071157S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6044847,"authors":[{"name":"Pongyupinpanich Surapong","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Research Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Pongyupinpanich","lastName":"Surapong","id":"37708182300"},{"name":"Manfred Glesner","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Research Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Glesner","id":"37277320300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044847","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"abstract":"To improve the computation precision of the beams control system in a heavy ion accelerator system, a floating-point phase and magnitude digital detector is proposed. The coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm is utilized to compute results in digital form. Due to the hardware design simplicity, shifting and adding operations become two main operators to perform the computation. The proposed CORDIC core is based on floating-point arithmetic units to obtain high accuracy for the closed-loop control system. A Pipeline-based architecture is applied instead of CORIDC's iteration process in order to maximize computation performance. Moreover, comparison of hardware 8-and 16-stage pipeline-based simulations with Matlab/simulink is statically analysis to differentiate the accuracy of the two hardware architectures. Finally, resource efficiencies based on target Xilinx FPGA xc5vlx110 and 130-nm Silicon technology are shown that 8-and 16-stage hardwares consume maximum 18% and 38% of total slices at 134 MHz on the target FPGA, as well as 43,164 um and 83,769 um at 617 MHz on Silicon technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate

The algorithm is modeled in Matlab Simulink using System Generator software from Xilinx. After validation through simulation, the algorithm is translated into a synchronous hardware automaton and then implemented in a low cost Spartan-3E FPGA device. Design performance in terms of occupied area and achieved speed is presented and compared to other existing implementations. The algorithm is used in AC drives control, and is especially useful due to minimized switching losses and short execution time. Also, its feature of using only one of the zero space vectors proves advantageous when using a low cost current measurement scheme based on voltage drop over low side shunt resistors. Experimental results verify the correct system functioning and validate the design method.","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044850.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized FPGA Implementation of the Modified Space Vector Modulation Algorithm for AC Drives Control","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.77","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized FPGA Implementation of the Modified Space Vector Modulation Algorithm for AC Drives Control","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307174","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044850/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized FPGA Implementation of the Modified Space Vector Modulation Algorithm for AC Drives Control","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056834S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6044854,"authors":[{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["DETI / IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"},{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["DETI / IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Dmitri Mihhailov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Mihhailov","id":"37541162600"},{"name":"Alexander Sudnitson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sudnitson","id":"37283482500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044854","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Sorting","Clocks","Bismuth","Hardware","Indexes","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","optimisation","sorting","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","address-based data sorting optimization","data items","memory addresses","one-bit flags","tree-walk tables","traversing N-ary trees","acceleration circuits","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data sort","FPGA","N-ary tree","HFSM"]}],"abstract":"The paper describes the hardware implementation and optimization of sorting algorithms that use data items as memory addresses with one-bit flags indicating presence of data.

Parsimony strives to find the phylogenetic tree that explains the evolutionary history of organisms by the least number of mutations. Because parsimony is a discrete function, it should fit well to FPGAs. We present a versatile FPGA implementation of the parsimony function and compare its performance to a highly optimized SSE3- and AVX-vectorized software implementation. We find that, because of a particular constellation in our lab, the speedups that can be achieved by using an FPGA, are substantially less impressive, than usually reported in papers on FPGA acceleration of bioinformatics kernels. We conclude that, a competitive spirit between SW and HW application developers can contribute toward obtaining more objective performance comparisons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Acceleration of the Phylogenetic Parsimony Kernel?","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.83","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044856.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Acceleration of the Phylogenetic Parsimony Kernel?","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044856/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307180","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Acceleration of the Phylogenetic Parsimony Kernel?","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064907S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6044862,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37888404400"},{"name":"Mihai Sima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Sima","id":"37294937000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044862","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":221},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitive Boosting for FPGA Interconnection Networks","abstract":"FPGA interconnection network is implemented using nMOS pass transistor multiplexers. Since the threshold voltage drop across an nMOS device degrades the high logic value, the pMOS transistors of the downstream buffers do not turn fully off, making this approach suffer from static power consumption due to the short-circuit currents and reduced noise margins. The standard pMOS transistor pull-up in the active feedback of an inverter reduces the static power consumption but degrades the switching time and/or dynamic power consumption. We propose to use capacitive boosting to increase the gate voltage of the pass transistors, thus driving the multiplexer output to the full high voltage level at a faster rate than the pMOS pull-up can alone. This way, the signal transitions are accelerated and the short-circuit current of downstream buffers are cut off. The simulations carried out with Cadence indicate a reduction of at least 10% in propagation delay for the proposed circuit versus the standard one across 180nm, 130nm, 90nm, and 65nm technologies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Logic gates","Integrated circuit interconnections","Field programmable gate arrays","MOS devices","Isolators","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","circuit feedback","circuit simulation","delay circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit noise","invertors","low-power electronics","MOS logic circuits","MOSFET","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive boosting","FPGA interconnection networks","nMOS pass transistor multiplexer","threshold voltage drop","nMOS device","downstream buffers","static power consumption","short-circuit current","noise margin reduction","standard pMOS transistor pull-up","inverter","active feedback","switching time","dynamic power consumption","gate voltage","signal transitions","propagation delay","size 180 nm","size 130 nm","size 90 nm","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["capacitive boosting","nMOS pass transistor multiplexers","FPGA interconnection network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044862","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.89","startPage":"453","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.89","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044862/","displayDocTitle":"Capacitive Boosting for FPGA Interconnection Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12307186","htmlLink":"/document/6044862/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitive Boosting for FPGA Interconnection Networks","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080765S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044864,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Gang Tai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yi-Gang","lastName":"Tai","id":"37666897700"},{"name":"Kleanthis Psarris","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kleanthis","lastName":"Psarris","id":"37295486200"},{"name":"Chia-Tien Dan Lo","affiliation":["Computer Science & Software Engineering, Southern Polytechnic State University, Marietta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Tien Dan","lastName":"Lo","id":"37589886000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044864","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Matrix decomposition","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-a-chip","Partitioning algorithms","Pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","hardware accelerators","GPU","scalable QR matrix decomposer","tiled matrix decomposition algorithms","high performance linear algebra","off-chip memory","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","QR matrix decomposition","hardware accelerator"]}],"abstract":"Hardware accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs in heterogeneous systems are being increasingly important for many applications.

Comparison of the two implementations proves that many-core graphics processing units can be a real alternative to FPGAs in the field of high performance computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307190","htmlLink":"/document/6044866/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Molecular Docking on FPGA and GPU Platforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Molecular Docking on FPGA and GPU Platforms","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05258S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044867,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Dohi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Dohi","id":"37545928000"},{"name":"Yuji Yorita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Yorita","id":"37887680100"},{"name":"Yuichiro Shibata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37286840400"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Oguri","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Oguri","id":"37292446400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044867","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":571},"abstract":"This paper shows stream-oriented FPGA implementation of the machine-learned Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) corner detection, which is used in the parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) for augmented reality (AR). One of the difficulties of compact hardware implementation of the FAST corner detection is a matching process with a large number of corner patterns. We propose corner pattern compression methods focusing on discriminant division and pattern symmetry for rotation and inversion. This pattern compression enables implementation of the corner pattern matching with a combinational circuit. Our prototype implementation achieves real-time execution performance with 7-9% of available slices of a Virtex-5 FPGA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field

Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks exploit power leakage to obtain the secret information. Dynamic and Differential Logic (DDL), one of the popular countermeasures against DPA attacks, tries to achieve constant power consumption thereby decor relating the leakage with the data being processed. Separated Dynamic and Differential Logic (SDDL), a variant of DDL, achieves this goal by duplicating the original design into Direct and Complementary parts which exhibit constant switching activity per clock cycle and have balanced net delays. Traditionally, on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) both parts are placed side-by-side to ensure symmetrical routing. However, due to process variations both parts will have slightly different delays. This limits the effectiveness of SDDL. In this paper we introduce a design flow to achieve interleaved placement of SDDL designs on Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGAs while preserving symmetric routing. We explore several placement configurations with respect to routing and security. The results of our experiments show that a well-balanced placement of SDDL can double the effectiveness of the SDDL countermeasures on FPGAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307197","htmlLink":"/document/6044873/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Security of SDDL Designs through Interleaved Placement on Xilinx FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Security of SDDL Designs through Interleaved Placement on Xilinx FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050341S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044875,"authors":[{"name":"Yousef S.

The second approach provides direct interactivity and visibility into a running FPGA design, enabling software-controlled breakpoints and arbitrary access to design registers. In-circuit breakpoints can be modified without the need to re-implement the entire design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Abstractions and Turnaround Time for FPGA Design Validation and Debug","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.102","startPage":"518","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044875.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved Abstractions and Turnaround Time for FPGA Design Validation and Debug","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044875/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307199","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Abstractions and Turnaround Time for FPGA Design Validation and Debug","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066348S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044876,"authors":[{"name":"Eddie Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Eddie","lastName":"Hung","id":"37679137500"},{"name":"Steven J.

When unexpected behaviour is observed in the prototype, it is necessary to determine the source of this behaviour, this usually requires observing signals that are internal to one of the devices in the prototype. Tools currently exist to enable FPGAs to be instrumented, but these are normally used in a reactive manner, that is, instrumentation is only added after incorrect behaviour has been observed. In this paper, we propose speculative debug insertion, in which a tool automatically predicts what signals will be useful during debug, and instruments the design during the first compilation. If done correctly, this can significantly accelerate the debug process, especially for large prototypes containing many FPGAs. However, it is important that this does not negatively affect the performance, capacity, power, or compilation time. We show that speculative debug insertion is possible, and experimentally evaluate the limits to speculative insertion.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2011.103","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044763/6044765/06044876.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2011.103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speculative Debug Insertion for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Speculative Debug Insertion for FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044876/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307200","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speculative Debug Insertion for FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"4529a524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053235S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044763","isNumber":"6044765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044763","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6044765","articleId":"6044876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044877,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiana Bolchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiana","lastName":"Bolchini","id":"37273944700"},{"name":"Antonio Miele","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Miele","id":"37273951700"},{"name":"Chiara Sandionigi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Sandionigi","id":"37540404700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1484-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4529-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6044877","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Shape","Pins","Wires","Performance evaluation","Fabrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated resource-aware floorplanning","reconfigurable area","partially-reconfigurable FPGA system","heterogeneous resource distribution","current-generation FPGA","complex architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["floorplanning","FPGA","partial reconfiguration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044877","abstract":"The floor planning activity is a key step in the design of systems on FPGAs, but the approaches available today rarely consider both the constraints imposed by the heterogeneous distribution of the resources in the devices and the reconfiguration capabilities.

At lower average power of 20.5dBm, DPC enables a 140% enhancement in average efficiency, hence battery life.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044882","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06044882.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 31.5dBm outphasing class-D power amplifier in 45nm CMOS with back-off efficiency enhancement by dynamic power control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A 31.5dBm outphasing class-D power amplifier in 45nm CMOS with back-off efficiency enhancement by dynamic power control","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044882/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306061","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 31.5dBm outphasing class-D power amplifier in 45nm CMOS with back-off efficiency enhancement by dynamic power control","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C029A3LH25042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052974S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6044883,"authors":[{"name":"Ercan Kaymaksut","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Kaymaksut","id":"37594648300"},{"name":"Patrick Reynaert","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Reynaert","id":"37427206700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0704-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0703-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0702-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"6044883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1415},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Wireless LAN","Power generation","Circuit faults","CMOS integrated circuits","Impedance","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS transformer-based uneven Doherty power amplifier","WLAN applications","fully integrated Doherty power amplifier","CMOS technology","Doherty combiner","two-stage uneven Doherty PA","spectral mask requirements","open loop digital predistortion","size 90 nm","frequency 2.4 GHz","voltage 2 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports a fully integrated Doherty power amplifier in standard 90 nm CMOS technology for 2.4 GHz WLAN applications.

The DDRM is organized in a FIR-like configuration to filter the quantization noise in the RX band directly at RF. To demonstrate the principle, a 0.9 GHz FIR IQ DDRM has been integrated in 130 nm CMOS. The transmitter achieves more than 22 dB reduction in the quantization noise floor to reach -152 dBc/Hz@20 MHz with a 200 kHz baseband tone. The actual DDRM is capable of both amplitude and phase modulation by using a new four-phases IQ architecture. This results in a reduced power consumption and chip area. The transmitter consumes 94 mW from a 2.7 V supply and achieves an average output power of 9.5 dBm. Leakage into the adjacent channel and into the next one of -35 dB and -53 dB, respectively have been measured for a 10 MHz OFDM signal. It also achieves -27.2 dB EVM with a 64QAM input signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044884/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306063","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS IQ direct digital RF modulator with embedded RF FIR-based quantization noise filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS IQ direct digital RF modulator with embedded RF FIR-based quantization noise filter","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C031A3LH45124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041555S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6044885,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Tight timing constraints in high-performance applications demand for a dedicated interconnect, which in general negatively affects the decoder features, especially the silicon area. Various approaches to reduce this impact have been discussed in literature which typically consider only a few if not just one level of the CMOS design process. However, for hardware efficient implementations a joint optimization on all design levels is mandatory. In this work we exemplarily present such an optimization for a (6, 32)-regular (2048, 1723) LDPC code ranging from an analysis of fix-point realizations of the decoding algorithm to an optimization on physical implementation level which can be applied to other codes, as well. The resulting decoder was implemented in a 40-nm CMOS technology. Circuit simulations of extracted netlists reveal an ATE-complexity reduction of more than one order of magnitude compared to known decoder implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044918","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06044918.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area- and energy-efficient high-throughput LDPC decoders with low block latency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Area- and energy-efficient high-throughput LDPC decoders with low block latency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044918/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12306087","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area- and energy-efficient high-throughput LDPC decoders with low block latency","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C015A3LE35413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0372S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044919,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsiang Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsiang","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37896304600"},{"name":"Yi-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405324600"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsie-Chia","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280773500"},{"name":"Chen-Yi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Yi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280413800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0704-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0703-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0702-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"6044919","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Complexity theory","Hardware","Encoding","Gain","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","codecs","forward error correction","integrated optoelectronics","optical communication equipment","optical fibre LAN","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft RS decoder chip","optical communication systems","forward error correction device","decision confined algorithm","error correcting performance","area efficient architecture","RS 255 code","RS 239 code","CMOS technology","GPON application","bit rate 2.56 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"Due to the increasing uncertainty of data for higher transmission rate, the Forward Error Correction (FEC) devices need to provide more powerful error correcting capability for optical communication systems.

Presently, the possibility of using class-D amplifiers in applications requiring better THD (THD <; -85 dB) is being investigated, in consideration of their possible application in huge markets (like high-performance audio). For this reason, the THD performance of conventional class-D structures is not enough and new topologies have to be analyzed and implemented.

Circuit design margins, to guarantee reliable analog circuit operation, are no longer sufficient and result in huge circuit overdesign. This paper discusses i) the most important transistor aging effects, ii) how designers can evaluate their impact on circuits and iii) design guidelines on which circuits are sensitive to transistor aging. Circuit parameters such as amplifier gain, bandwidth and slewrate are shown to be immune to transistor aging, while variation-sensitive parameters such as offset, the output current of a current mirror and the on-resistance of a MOS-resistor are very prone to transistor aging. Furthermore, to help a designer estimate the impact of aging on his/her circuit and to find a good reliability-performance tradeoff, a first-order transistor aging model is provided.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Aging","CMOS integrated circuits","Analog circuits","Integrated circuit reliability","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","analogue circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistor aging-induced degradation","analog circuits","impact analysis","design guidelines","transistor aging effects","ultra-scaled CMOS process","circuit design margins","analog circuit operation","output current","MOS-resistor","reliability-performance tradeoff","first-order transistor aging model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044952","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06044952.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transistor aging-induced degradation of analog circuits: Impact analysis and design guidelines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transistor aging-induced degradation of analog circuits: Impact analysis and design guidelines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044952/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044952/","accessionNumber":"12306120","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transistor aging-induced degradation of analog circuits: Impact analysis and design guidelines","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C057B3LE15152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073949S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6044954,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Raoul Chouard","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian Raoul","lastName":"Chouard","id":"38275986600"},{"name":"Shailesh More","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Shailesh","lastName":"More","id":"38270003700"},{"name":"Michael Fulde","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fulde","id":"37392879200"},{"name":"Doris Schmitt-Landsiedel","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Doris","lastName":"Schmitt-Landsiedel","id":"38270167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0704-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0703-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0702-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"6044954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044954","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Aging","Calibration","Annealing","Temperature measurement","Reliability","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aging suppression","calibration approach","differential amplifiers","advanced CMOS technologies","stress experiments","analog size devices","relaxing stress phenomena","differential amplifier circuits","process variation induced mismatch"]}],"abstract":"Stress experiments are presented on analog size devices in inversion and accumulation mode, including relaxing stress phenomena.

This is at least an order of magnitude better than current state-of-the-art implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044963","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06044963.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully-digital, 0.3V, 270 nW capacitive sensor interface without external references","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044963/","displayDocTitle":"A fully-digital, 0.3V, 270 nW capacitive sensor interface without external references","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306131","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6044963/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully-digital, 0.3V, 270 nW capacitive sensor interface without external references","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C068B3LG35357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037166S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6044964,"authors":[{"name":"Mikail Y\u00fcceta\u015f","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikail","lastName":"Y\u00fcceta\u015f","id":"37543226300"},{"name":"Lasse Aaltonen","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Lasse","lastName":"Aaltonen","id":"37300914300"},{"name":"Mika Pulkkinen","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Pulkkinen","id":"37594808000"},{"name":"Jarno Salomaa","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarno","lastName":"Salomaa","id":"37543228000"},{"name":"Antti Kalanti","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Kalanti","id":"37543214200"},{"name":"Kari Halonen","affiliation":["SMARAD-2/Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Kari","lastName":"Halonen","id":"37271435300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0704-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0703-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0702-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"6044964","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6044964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accelerometers","Transfer functions","Electrodes","Clocks","Force","Damping","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","analogue-digital conversion","capacitive sensors","CMOS integrated circuits","delta-sigma modulation","electrostatics","feedback","microsensors","open loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge balancing accelerometer interface","electrostatic damping","switched capacitor accelerometer sensor interface","self-balancing bridge topology","ratiometric output","signal detection","high quality factor","micromechanical sensor element","force-feedback","proportional-derivative controller","open-loop topology","open-loop readout","2nd-order single-bit \u0394\u03a3 converter","analog-to-digital conversion","CMOS process","current consumption","maximum DC nonlinearity","SNR","signal bandwidth","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.6 V","current 1 mA","noise figure 91 dB","bandwidth 200 Hz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a switched capacitor accelerometer sensor interface.

The high voltages of the driving stage can be set to a constant value and do not have to be adjusted. The driving stage can be realized with a set of simple switches applying two fixed voltages to the gyroscope for actuation. This reduces the complexity of the circuitry enormously.

The FSR loops can accelerate load transient responses while the regulator achieves the FOM of only 0.00675 (ps) without an output capacitor.

The circuit is able to track the temperature behaviour of the PCM cell current over a temperature range from -40\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C, as is necessary to meet the stringent requirements of multilevel PCM sensing. The proposed scheme is based on an MOS transistor biased in saturation below its zero temperature coefficient (ZTC) point. Only room temperature trimming at wafer sort is required to adjust the value and the temperature dependence of the generated current. Experimental results showed good agreement with experimental data on PCM cells. The error in the programmed temperature coefficient is kept within 10% in any process condition.","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06044996.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044996","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current reference scheme for multilevel phase-change memory sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Current reference scheme for multilevel phase-change memory sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6044996/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6044996/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306164","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current reference scheme for multilevel phase-change memory sensing","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C101C3LF45235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064948S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6044996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6044997,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Yuan Wen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yuan","lastName":"Wen","id":"37676901200"},{"name":"Jeyanandh Paramesh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeyanandh","lastName":"Paramesh","id":"37372242100"},{"name":"Larry Pileggi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Pileggi","id":"37273687500"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The measured phase noise is -127 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset frequency resulting in a FoM of 192.3 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-swing class-C VCO","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6045015","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034695/6044880/06045015.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6045015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6044880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-swing class-C VCO","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045015/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12306183","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-swing class-C VCO","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"C120C5LH25466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038317S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034695","isNumber":"6044880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034695","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6044880","articleId":"6045015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6045027,"authors":[{"name":"Yuguang Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuguang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37897897200"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"37635095500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-204-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-203-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-202-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6045027","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1433},"abstract":"Naive Bayes algorithm is one of the most effective methods in the field of text classification, but only in the large training sample set can it get a more accurate result.

It enables the users to move their data and application software to the network which is different from traditional solutions. Due to this IT services are not under logical, physical and users' controls, it brings many new different security challenges. Ensuring data storage security is one more urgent of them. The representative network architecture for cloud data storage includes a third party auditor which affords trustful authentication for user to operate their data security in cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of data storage security in cloud computing. A novel third party auditor scheme is proposed. The obvious advantage of our scheme is the cloud service provider can offer the functions which were provided by the traditional third party auditor and make it trustful. So it indeed reduces the constitution's complexity in Cloud Computing.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2011.6045072","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034549/6045020/06045072.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2011.6045072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045020","startPage":"264","endPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring data storage security through a novel third party auditor scheme in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring data storage security through a novel third party auditor scheme in cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045072/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12305892","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045072/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring data storage security through a novel third party auditor scheme in cloud computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"052085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052047S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034549","isNumber":"6045020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034549","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6045020","articleId":"6045072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6045073,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37899957500"},{"name":"Liehuang Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liehuang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37692927900"},{"name":"Longyijia Li","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Longyijia","lastName":"Li","id":"37900034200"},{"name":"Yu'an Tan","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu'an","lastName":"Tan","id":"37555001200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-204-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-203-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-202-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6045073","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Cloud computing","Keyword search","Dictionaries","Computers","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","fuzzy set theory","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy keyword search","encrypted cloud storage data","encrypted data","searchable encryption scheme","cloud storage systems","wildcard-based fuzzy set construction","dictionary-based fuzzy set construction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud storage","fuzzy keyword search","index","dictionary-based fuzzy set"]}],"abstract":"To ensure that the data can be stored in the cloud securely, people encrypt their data before outsourcing to the cloud, which makes searching on a large amount of encrypted data become a demanding task. Traditional searchable encryption schemes provide a range of approaches to search on encrypted data, but they only support exact keyword search. Exact keyword search is not suitable for cloud storage systems, because it doesn't allow users making any spelling errors or format inconsistencies, which greatly reduce the system usability. To the best of our knowledge, the relatively most feasible scheme published so far which supports fuzzy keyword search is the \u201cWildcard-based Fuzzy Set Construction\u201d (INFOCOM 2010), in which each keyword is corresponding with O(l\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sup>\n) fuzzy keywords when the keyword length is l and the edit distance is d. In this paper we present the \u201cDictionary-based Fuzzy Set Construction\u201d, in which each keyword is corresponding with much less fuzzy keywords. This improvement greatly reduces the index size, thereby reducing the storage and communication overheads.

Moreover, the chipset can reach up to -100.5-dBm sensitivity in a 10-MHz AWGN channel, which outperforms WiMAX Forum mobile radio conformance test (MRCT) by 9.5 dB. Such high sensitivity is due to the proposed low-noise high-linearity RF transceiver chip, which has 2.5-dB RX noise figure (NF) and -37-dB TX error vector magnitude (EVM), and the applied high-performance baseband signal processing algorithms. Several low-power design techniques-from SW level, firmware/DSP level, to HW module level-have been implemented to enable portable applications. The modem/router chip is highly integrated and has rich features and various interfaces for applications such as router or VoIP phone. Furthermore, this is the only published WiMAX chipset which has been in mass production.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6109882/06045298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2167811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6109882","startPage":"61","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 70-Mb/s 100.5-dBm Sensitivity 65-nm LP MIMO Chipset for WiMAX Portable Router","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 70-Mb/s 100.5-dBm Sensitivity 65-nm LP MIMO Chipset for WiMAX Portable Router","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425658","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045298/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 70-Mb/s 100.5-dBm Sensitivity 65-nm LP MIMO Chipset for WiMAX Portable Router","sourcePdf":"jssc-liao-2167811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106369S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6109882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6109882","articleId":"6045298","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6045299,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Nigam","affiliation":["Intelligent, Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA","Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6228555/6045299/6045299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikhil Nigam received the B.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)\u2014Bombay, Mumbai, India, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Research Scientist at Intelligent Automation Inc., Rockville, MD, where he is currently working on NextGen concepts and accurate positioning systems on-board aircraft.

The task of persistent surveillance is of particular significance in that the target area needs to be continuously surveyed, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This distinction from one-time coverage does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, though ideas from these methods can still be used. The aerial vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints add additional complexity to the autonomous control problem, whereas stochastic environments and vehicle failures introduce uncertainty. In this work, we investigate techniques for high-level control, that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. Next, we suggest a modification to the control policy to account for aircraft dynamic constraints. We also devise a health monitoring policy and a control policy modification to improve performance under endurance constraints. The Vehicle Swarm Technology Laboratory-a hardware testbed developed at Boeing Research and Technology, Seattle, WA, for evaluating a swarm of unmanned air vehicles-is then described, and these control policies are tested in a realistic scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2167331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6228555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2167331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6228555/06045299.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Multiple UAVs for Persistent Surveillance: Algorithm and Flight Test Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Control of Multiple UAVs for Persistent Surveillance: Algorithm and Flight Test Results","volume":"20","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045299/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12820774","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045299/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Multiple UAVs for Persistent Surveillance: Algorithm and Flight Test Results","sourcePdf":"tcst-nigam-2167331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168121S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6228555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"6228555","articleId":"6045299","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6045301,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6216496/6045301/6045301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Li (M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007.","He is now an Assistant Professor with the Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University.

However, the technical trend of data center design poses new challenges for efficient and scalable multicast routing. First, the densely connected networks make traditional receiver-driven multicast routing protocols inefficient in multicast tree formation. Second, it is quite difficult for the low-end switches widely used in data centers to hold the routing entries of massive multicast groups. In this paper, we propose ESM, an efficient and scalable multicast routing scheme for data center networks. ESM addresses the challenges above by exploiting the feature of modern data center networks. Based on the regular topology of data centers, ESM uses a source-to-receiver expansion approach to build efficient multicast trees, excluding many unnecessary intermediate switches used in receiver-driven multicast routing. For scalable multicast routing, ESM combines both in-packet Bloom Filters and in-switch entries to make the tradeoff between the number of multicast groups supported and the additional bandwidth overhead. Simulations show that ESM saves 40% ~ 50% network traffic and doubles the application throughputs compared to receiver-driven multicast routing, and the combination routing scheme significantly reduces the number of in-switch entries required. We implement ESM on a Linux platform. The experimental results further demonstrate that ESM can well support online tree building for large-scale groups with churns, and the overhead of the combination forwarding engine is light-weighted.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2169985","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6216496/06045301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2169985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6216496","startPage":"944","endPage":"955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ESM: Efficient and Scalable Data Center Multicast Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ESM: Efficient and Scalable Data Center Multicast Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12786486","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6045301/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ESM: Efficient and Scalable Data Center Multicast Routing","sourcePdf":"tnet-li-2169985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08405S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6216496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6216496","articleId":"6045301","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6045302,"authors":[{"name":"Siamak Sorooshyari","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6216496/6045302/6045302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siamak Sorooshyari received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently a Member of the Technical Staff with Bell Laboratories\u2014Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, where he is involved in the development of physical-layer and link-layer algorithms for next-generation wireless data networks."]},"firstName":"Siamak","lastName":"Sorooshyari","id":"37421558400"},{"name":"Chee Wei Tan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6216496/6045302/6045302-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chee Wei Tan (M'08) received the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","He is an Assistant Professor with City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, load curves always contain abnormal, noisy, unrepresentative, and missing data due to various random factors. It is crucial to identify and repair such data. Previous works focused on detecting Y-outliers that are unusual power consumptions (Y-axis) in a small temporal neighborhood. This paper presents a different class of X-outliers that have abnormal power consumptions according to a known periodicity (X-axis). The underlying assumption is that the data set follows a periodicity and the length (not the pattern) of the periodicity is known. This is the case for most real load curve data collected at BC Hydro. We discuss possible causes of X-outliers and rationales of identifying and cleaning them. A novel solution to detect and repair X-outliers is proposed. Real load curve data in the BC Hydro system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2167022","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06045306.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"884","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2167022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting X-Outliers in Load Curve Data in Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detecting X-Outliers in Load Curve Data in Power Systems","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12692005","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting X-Outliers in Load Curve Data in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2167022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042893S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6045306","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6045309,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical, Electronic, and Industrial Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yu Liu is an Associate Professor of the School of Mechanical, Electronic, and Industrial Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, the adequacy of an imperfect maintenance model must be validated before it is used in decision making. The most adequate imperfect maintenance model among the candidates to facilitate decision making is also desired. The contributions of this paper lie in three aspects: 1 it proposes an approach to conducting a goodness-of-flt test, 2 it introduces a Bayesian approach to selecting the most adequate model among several competitive candidates, and 3 it develops a framework that incorporates the model selection results into the preventive maintenance decision making. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by three designed numerical studies. The case studies show that the proposed methods are able to identify the most adequate model from the competitive candidates, and incorporating the model selection results into the maintenance decision model achieves better estimation for applications with limited data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Optical fibers","Mathematical model","Numerical models","Preventive maintenance","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","preventive maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven approach","imperfect maintenance models","decision making","goodness-of-flt test","Bayesian approach","preventive maintenance","maintenance decision model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian model selection","bootstrap sampling","goodness-of-fit","imperfect maintenance model","u-pooling method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TR.2011.2170252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/6159254/06045309.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2011.2170252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Selecting Imperfect Maintenance Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Selecting Imperfect Maintenance Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045309/","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045309/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12571148","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach to Selecting Imperfect Maintenance Models","sourcePdf":"tr-huang-2170252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138907S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"6159254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6159254","articleId":"6045309","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6045311,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A method for obtaining the optimum coefficients that lead to the lowest error is proposed. This approach can be used to get more accurate rotations without increasing the coefficient word length and to reduce the word length without increasing the rotation error. This brief analyzes two different situations where the optimization method can be applied: rotations that can be optimized independently and sets of rotations that require the same scaling. These cases appear in important signal processing algorithms such as the discrete cosine transform and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Experimental results show that the use of scaling for the coefficients clearly improves the accuracy of the algorithms. For instance, improvements of about 8 dB in the Frobenius norm of the FFT are achieved with respect to using non-scaled coefficients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"58","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12300825","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045324/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Rotations Based on Coefficient Scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Rotations Based on Coefficient Scaling","sourcePdf":"tcsii-garrido-2164144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078144S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6045691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6045691","articleId":"6045324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6045328,"authors":[{"name":"Peter A.

They are commonly accepted to be important and have been applied to tackle single-objective optimization problems in many fields. For multiobjective optimization problems, much less is known about the gradient and its algorithmic use. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the understanding of gradients for numerical, i.e., real-valued, multiobjective optimization. Specifically, we provide an analytical parametric description of the set of all nondominated, i.e., most promising, directions in which a solution can be moved such that the objective values either improve or remain the same. This result completes previous work where this set is described only for one particular case, namely when some of the nondominated directions have positive, i.e., nonimproving, components and the final set can be computed by taking the subset of directions that are all nonpositive. In addition we use our result to assess the utility of using gradient information for multiobjective optimization where the goal is to obtain a Pareto set of solutions that approximates the optimal Pareto set. To this end, we design and consider various multiobjective gradient-based optimization algorithms. One of these algorithms uses the description of the multiobjective gradient provided here. Also, we hybridize an existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with the various multiobjective gradient-based optimization algorithms. During optimization, the performance of the gradient-based optimization algorithms is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective algorithm to spend the most resources. We perform an experimental analysis using a few well-known benchmark problems to compare the performance of different optimization methods. The results underline that the use of a population of solutions that is characteristic of MOEAs is a powerful concept if the goal is to obtain a good Pareto set, i.e., instead of only a single solution. This makes it hard to increase convergence speed in the initial phase using gradient information to improve any single solution. However, in the longer run, the use of gradient information does ultimately allow for better fine-tuning of the results and thus better overall convergence.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6141203/06045328.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Gradients and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Real-Valued Multiobjective Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"On Gradients and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Real-Valued Multiobjective Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12494170","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6045328/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Gradients and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Real-Valued Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-pbosman-2051445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147509S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6141203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6141203","articleId":"6045328","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6045330,"authors":[{"name":"Sertac Karaman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6249762/6045330/6045330-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sertac Karaman received the B.S. degrees in mechanical engineering and computer science from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2007, and the S.M. degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2009.

Images, as well as results, from detection of vehicles in dense forest concealment have been compared with linear-aperture SAR. Circular-aperture SAR imaging provides higher image resolution and increased object information, but complexity of signal processing and requirements on imaging geometry accuracy increases. The latter is, however, partly mitigated by using low frequencies in the VHF band. A high-quality digital elevation model is used to ensure high-quality image focusing and to avoid distorting object shape. Contrast optimization is used to reduce global focusing errors.

To obtain a quality SAR image, the spatial sampling must be dense enough to accurately sample the electric field reflected from a target. Conversely, the quantity of spatial samples may be optimally reduced, resulting in reduced system complexity and required resources for systems employing real apertures and reduced imaging time for synthetic aperture systems. In the literature, it has been reported that the optimum sampling step size is equal to the theoretical resolution, as per the Nyquist rate. It has also been reported that an image generated using a sampling step size equal to the theoretical resolution may not possess the same spatial resolution as predicted. Also, as expected and reported, resolution is dependent upon the distance between the target and the aperture, aperture dimensions, and antenna beamwidth. However, existing formulations of SAR resolution do not account for all of the physical characteristics of a measurement (e.g., 2-D limited-size aperture, electric field decreasing with distance from the measuring antenna, etc.). This paper presents a theoretical formulation of resolution and a study into optimum uniform spatial sampling by analyzing simulated 3-D SAR images according to metrics representing image quality, namely, half-power resolution and RMS error between practically sampled images and an ideally sampled image. The results of this simulation demonstrate optimum sampling given design requirements that fully explain resolution dependence on sampling step size. Also, it is found that there is additional widening of the 2-D spectral estimation of the data due to the aperture-limited nature of the measurements, which further influences the choice of sampling step size. Subsequently, the simulated results are compared to experimental results corroborating the efficacy of the formulation. Finally, design curves and procedures are proposed for selecting sampling step size as per resolution requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2169177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2169177","startPage":"3806","endPage":"3815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6064350/06045337.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Two-Dimensional Uniform Spatial Sampling for Microwave SAR-Based NDE Imaging Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Two-Dimensional Uniform Spatial Sampling for Microwave SAR-Based NDE Imaging Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045337/","accessionNumber":"12331234","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045337/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Two-Dimensional Uniform Spatial Sampling for Microwave SAR-Based NDE Imaging Systems","sourcePdf":"tim-case-2169177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078115S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6064350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6064350","articleId":"6045337","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6045350,"authors":[{"name":"Raffaella Carloni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6145195/6045350/6045350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raffaella Carloni (M\u201908) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.","She is an Assistant Professor with the Control Engineering Group, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, within the Center of Excellence on Intelligent Mechatronic Systems.

This is mechanically achieved by the internal introduction of a number of elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs), which determine how the elastic elements are sensed at the output. During the nominal behavior of these actuators, the power flow from the internal actuated DOFs can be such that energy is undesirably stored in the elastic elements because of the specific kinematic structure of the actuator. In this study, we focus on the analysis of the power flow in variable stiffness actuators. More specifically, the analysis is restricted to the kinematic structure of the actuators, in order to show the influence of the topological structure on the power flow, rather than on the realization choices. We define a measure that indicates the ratio between the total amount of power that is injected by the internal actuated DOFs and the power that is captured by the internal elastic elements which, therefore, cannot be used to do work on the load. In order to define the power-flow ratio, we exploit a generic port-based model of variable stiffness actuators, which highlights the kinematic properties of the design and the power flows in the actuator structure.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2168709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6145195/06045350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2168709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Variable Stiffness Actuators: A Port-Based Power-Flow Analysis","volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6045350/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12524337","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Stiffness Actuators: A Port-Based Power-Flow Analysis","sourcePdf":"tro-carloni-2168709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154151S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6145195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6145195","articleId":"6045350","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6045352,"authors":[{"name":"Shay Maymon","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6045352/6045352-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shay Maymon (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree and the M.Sc. degree both in electrical engineering from Tel-Aviv University (TAU), Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 1998 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2011.","While at MIT, he was a Research Assistant with the Digital Signal Processing Group (DSPG).

Such systems take the form of either uniform or recurrent nonuniform sampling, depending on the relative timing between the channels. Uniform (i.e., linear) quantization in each channel results in an effective overall signal-to-quantization-error ratio (SQNR) in the reconstructed output which is dependent on the quantizer step size in each channel, the relative timing between the channels, and the oversampling ratio. It is shown that in the multichannel sampling system when the quantization step size is not restricted to be the same in each channel and the channel timing is not constrained to correspond to uniform sampling, it is often possible to increase the SQNR relative to the uniform case. Appropriate choice of these parameters together with the design of appropriate compensation filtering is developed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2171954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06045352.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"138","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2171954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization and Compensation in Sampled Interleaved Multichannel Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Quantization and Compensation in Sampled Interleaved Multichannel Systems","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6045352/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425255","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization and Compensation in Sampled Interleaved Multichannel Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-maymon-2171954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066137S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6045352","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6045353,"authors":[{"name":"Rad Niazadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rad","lastName":"Niazadeh","id":"38190889100"},{"name":"Massoud Babaie-Zadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Babaie-Zadeh","id":"38270068000"},{"name":"Christian Jutten","affiliation":["Institut Universitaire de France, France","GIPSA-Lab, Department of Images and Signals, UMR CNRS 5216, University of Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Jutten","id":"37284647800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6045353","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1350},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Noise","Compressed sensing","Linear matrix inequalities","Estimation","Joints","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian noise","matrix algebra","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao bound","noisy compressed sensing","asymptotic achievability","measurement matrix","Gaussianity assumption","deterministic matrix","compressive sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chernoff bound","compressed sensing","joint typicality","typical estimation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, it has been proved in Babadi [B. Babadi, N. Kalouptsidis, and V. Tarokh, \u201cAsymptotic achievability of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound for noisy compressive sampling,\u201d IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 57, no. 3, pp. 1233-1236, 2009] that in noisy compressed sensing, a joint typical estimator can asymptotically achieve the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound of the problem. To prove this result, Babadi used a lemma, which is provided in Ak\u00e7akaya and Tarokh [M. Ak\u00e7akaya and V.

This lemma is based on the assumption of Gaussianity of the measurement matrix and its randomness in the domain of noise. In this correspondence, we generalize the results obtained in Babadi by dropping the Gaussianity assumption on the measurement matrix. In fact, by considering the measurement matrix as a deterministic matrix in our analysis, we find a theorem similar to the main theorem of Babadi for a family of randomly generated (but deterministic in the noise domain) measurement matrices that satisfy a generalized condition known as \u201cthe concentration of measures inequality.\u201d By this, we finally show that under our generalized assumptions, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound of the estimation is achievable by using the typical estimator introduced in Babadi et al.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Achievability of Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bound in Noisy Compressed Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2171953","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06045353.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2171953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Achievability of Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bound in Noisy Compressed Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6045353/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425256","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Achievability of Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bound in Noisy Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-niazadeh-2171953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108166S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6045353","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6045354,"authors":[{"name":"Suba R.

In addition to supporting multiple-access, the FAH is introduced also to achieve transmit diversity by sending every MSSK symbol over several time-slots under the control of a FAH pattern (address). Associated with the MSSK FAH-SDMA, a range of linear and nonlinear detection schemes are studied. Specifically, the linear detection schemes considered include the matched-filtering single-user detector (MF-SUD), zero-forcing multiuser detector (ZF-MUD) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-MUD, while the nonlinear detection schemes addressed include the maximum likelihood (ML)-MUD and the receiver multiuser diversity aided multi-stage MMSE (RMD/MS-MMSE) MUD. The single-user pairwise error probability (SU-PEP) and bit error rate (BER) union-bound of the single-user MSSK FAH-SDMA systems employing ML detection are analyzed in detail. Based on the SU-PEP, the minimum transmit diversity order of the MSSK FAH-SDMA systems is specified. For the MSSK FAH-SDMA systems with linear detection, we study two types of MSSK demodulation schemes, which are referred to as the intrauser detections (IUDs), named as the maximum likelihood (ML)-IUD and direct (D)-IUD. For the MSSK FAH-SDMA systems employing the RMD/MS-MMSE MUD, two types of reliability measurement (RM) schemes are proposed, which are the maximum a-posteriori (MAP)-RM and ratio test (RT)-RM. Finally, the BER performance of the MSSK FAH-SDMA systems with various combinations of the proposed techniques is studied, when assuming that the channels from any transmit antennas to any receive antennas experience independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2171955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2171955","startPage":"351","endPage":"366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06045355.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Detection in Antenna-Hopping Space-Division Multiple-Access Systems With Space-Shift Keying Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Signal Detection in Antenna-Hopping Space-Division Multiple-Access Systems With Space-Shift Keying Modulation","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425258","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6045355/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Detection in Antenna-Hopping Space-Division Multiple-Access Systems With Space-Shift Keying Modulation","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2171955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118367S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6045355","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6045368,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Sannier","affiliation":["IRISA, INRIA, Rennes, France","EDF Research and Development/STEP, Chatou, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Sannier","id":"37089039249"},{"name":"Beno\u00eet Baudry","affiliation":["IRISA, INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Baudry","id":"37280045400"},{"name":"Thuy Nguyen","affiliation":["EDF Research and Development/STEP, Chatou, France"],"firstName":"Thuy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37859068800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0959-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0957-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045368","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Context","IEC standards","Software","Power generation","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","legislation","safety","standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regulations variability","longlife projects","model-driven engineering","safety regulations","safety standards","nuclear power plant systems","domain-specific modeling","regulatory safety requirements","requirements modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["requirements","standards","regulations","safety","practice","variability","traceability","modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045368","doi":"10.1109/MoDRE.2011.6045368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MoDRE.2011.6045368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045358","publicationTitle":"2011 Model-Driven Requirements Engineering Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Model-Driven Requirements Engineering Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6035928/6045358/06045368.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formalizing standards and regulations variability in longlife projects.

Based on an SDU decomposition of the gain matrix, a singularity-free adaptive tracking control law is proposed that is shown to be globally asymptotically stable (GAS) under full-state feedback. Output feedback results are facilitated via the use of a high-gain observer (HGO). Under output feedback control, ultimate boundedness of the error signals is obtained - the size of the bound is related to the size of the uncertainty in the parameters. An explicit upper bound is also provided on the size of the HGO gain constant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lyapunov-based adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.2011.6045409","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034546/6045377/06045409.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.2011.6045409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lyapunov-based adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045409/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12326538","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lyapunov-based adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101458S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034546","isNumber":"6045377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034546","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6045377","articleId":"6045409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6045441,"authors":[{"name":"Cedric Nugteren","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Nugteren","id":"37888310500"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"},{"name":"Bart Mesman","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Mesman","id":"37295514700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045441","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skeleton","Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Image processing","System-on-a-chip","Kernel","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","image classification","parallel algorithms","program compilers","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skeleton-based automatic parallelization","image processing algorithm","graphics processing unit","high performance computing","parallel algorithm","sequential code map","code-annotation","GPU specific parallelization technique","automatic thread creation","on-chip memory usage","memory coalescing","finer-grained classification","GPU code generator","code optimization","data throughput"]}],"abstract":"Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are becoming increasingly important in high performance computing. To maintain high quality solutions, programmers have to efficiently parallelize and map their algorithms. This task is far from trivial, leading to the necessity to automate this process. In this paper, we present a technique to automatically parallelize and map sequential code on a GPU, without the need for code-annotations. This technique is based on skeletonization and is targeted at image processing algorithms. Skeletonization separates the structure of a parallel computation from the algorithm's functionality, enabling efficient implementations without requiring architecture knowledge from the programmer. We define a number of skeleton classes, each enabling GPU specific parallelization techniques and optimizations, including automatic thread creation, on-chip memory usage and memory coalescing. Recently, similar skeletonization techniques have been applied to GPUs. Our work uses domain specific skeletons and a finer-grained classification of algorithms. Comparing skeleton-based parallelization to existing GPU code generators in general, we potentially achieve a higher hardware efficiency by enabling algorithm restructuring through skeletons. In a set of benchmarks, we show that the presented skeleton-based approach generates highly optimized code, achieving high data throughput. Additionally, we show that the automatically generated code performs close or equal to manually mapped and optimized code. We conclude that skeleton-based parallelization for GPUs is promising, but we do believe that future research must focus on the identification of a finer-grained and complete classification.","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045441","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045441.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skeleton-based automatic parallelization of image processing algorithms for GPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Skeleton-based automatic parallelization of image processing algorithms for GPUs","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045441/","accessionNumber":"12307834","publicationDate":"July 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeleton-based automatic parallelization of image processing algorithms for GPUs","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094668S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6045452,"authors":[{"name":"Teemu Nyl\u00e4nden","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Teemu","lastName":"Nyl\u00e4nden","id":"37593856200"},{"name":"Janne Janhunen","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, Computer Science and Engineering Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Janhunen","id":"37593856300"},{"name":"Jari Hannuksela","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Hannuksela","id":"37550509500"},{"name":"Olli Silv\u00e9n","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Olli","lastName":"Silv\u00e9n","id":"37267339700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045452","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cyclones","Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Wireless sensor networks","Power dissipation","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microcontrollers","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based application specific processing","field programmable gate array","sensor node","embedded systems technology","programmable microcontrollers","digital signal processors","power consumption","Flash FPGA technology","hardware accelerators","radio baseband","wireless sensor nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045452","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045452","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","abstract":"Energy efficient sensor nodes are among the rapidly expanding applications for embedded systems technology. Typically, the processing resources in sensor nodes are based on programmable micro-controllers and digital signal processors, and the same processing architecture is used regardless of the actual task of the node. This regularly results in at least an order of magnitude over-provisioning of resources, and in higher power consumption than would be needed by tightly application specific processing solutions. Currently, experiments show that Flash FPGA technology enables implementing precisely provisioned processing for sensor nodes with energy efficiency that rivals off-the-shelf processor solutions. The expected competitiveness originates from savings in silicon real-estate, and lowered software overheads, as inherently parallel tasks can be offloaded to dedicated hardware accelerators on the same die with a microcontroller unit, and radio baseband. The results pave the way for a novel type of self-powered sensor nodes whose processing resources are configured according to their tasks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045452.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based application specific processing for sensor nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045452/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based application specific processing for sensor nodes","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12307845","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based application specific processing for sensor nodes","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052764S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6045453,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Le Masle","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Le Masle","id":"37545737300"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"},{"name":"Csaba Andras Moritz","affiliation":["BlueRISC, Inc., Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Csaba Andras","lastName":"Moritz","id":"37274532100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045453","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Jacobian matrices","Computer architecture","Hardware","Calculators","Adders","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lucas probabilistic primality test","parametric hardware architecture","American National Institute of Standards and Technology","Jacobi symbol","binary Jacobi algorithm","pipelined modular add-shift module","dependence analysis","Lucas sequences computation","Virtex-5 FPGA","software version running","Intel Xeon W3505","ASIC implementation","speed-area-energy trade-offs","cell count","power consumption","embedded system","server applications","size 45 nm"]}],"abstract":"We present our parametric hardware architecture of the NIST approved Lucas probabilistic primality test.

The proposed approach generates models that predict hardware performance indicators for reconfigurable components, such as the number of slices, the number of flip-flops, and the number of wires. It utilizes automatic model selection, artificial neural networks, (logistic) regression, and data transformations. These models take a high-level language description as input, enabling hardware prediction in the early design stages. We calibrate the models for two sets of tools targeting Xilinx and Altera FPGAs, where we report, for example, and error of 14% for the number of multipliers in case of Xilinx and an error of only 18% for the number of wires in case of Altera. To provide a realistic evaluation, we validate the approach using 181 kernels, contrary to the majority of the existing techniques, which use libraries of tens of kernels at most.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and

Besides high computational complexity, irregular control flow and sequential nature of the tree search represent major limitations of depth-first-based detectors, frustrating efficient application of parallelization techniques and hence leading to inefficient realizations with regard to most practical applications. This work presents a novel TSD implementation, scalable in constellation size and number of antennas and mapped to a highly parallel and pipelined ASIP architecture. Major challenges and key strategies enabling a high-throughput and low-complexity realization are presented and performance of the resulting flexible and efficient detector implementation is evaluated. Proposed realization is shown to achieve >; 300 Mbps throughput at a reference clock frequency of 400 MHz (regarding 4\u00d74 MIMO transmission with 16-QAM), by far outperforming comparable state-of-the-art realizations.","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045466","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","startPage":"233","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable ASIP implementation and parallelization of a MIMO sphere detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scalable ASIP implementation and parallelization of a MIMO sphere detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045466/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12307859","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045466/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable ASIP implementation and parallelization of a MIMO sphere detector","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104584S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6045467,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Langemeyer","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Langemeyer","id":"37269000700"},{"name":"Peter Pirsch","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Pirsch","id":"37271384700"},{"name":"Holger Blume","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Blume","id":"37337766500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045467","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SDRAM","Indexes","Pipelines","Bandwidth","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional access","transposing","SDRAM memories","address mapping scheme","two-dimensional index-space","bank interleaving method","double buffering","2D-FFT processing","radar application"]}],"abstract":"When transposing large matrices using SDRAM memories, typically a control overhead significantly reduces the data throughput. In this paper, a new address mapping scheme is introduced, taking advantage of multiple banks and burst capabilities of modern SDRAMs. Other address mapping strategies minimize the total number of SDRAM page-opens while traversing the two-dimensional index-space in row or column direction. The new approach uses bank interleaving methods to hide wait cycles, caused by page-opens. In this way, data bus wait cycles do not depend on the overall number of page-opens directly. It is shown, that the data bus utilization can be increased significantly, in particular, if memories are accessed with parallel samples. Therefore, double buffering can be omitted. As a special operation, 2D-FFT processing for radar applications is considered. Depending on SDRAM parameters and dimensions, a continuous bandwidth utilization of 96 to 98% is achieved for accesses in both matrix directions, including all refresh commands.","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045467","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045467.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using SDRAMs for two-dimensional accesses of long 2<sup>n</sup> \u00d7 2<sup>m</sup>-point FFTs and transposing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045467/","displayDocTitle":"Using SDRAMs for two-dimensional accesses of long 2<sup>n</sup> \u00d7 2<sup>m</sup>-point FFTs and transposing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045467/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12307860","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using SDRAMs for two-dimensional accesses of long 2<sup>n</sup> \u00d7 2<sup>m</sup>-point FFTs and transposing","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055041S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6045472,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwei Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Chengwei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37594885600"},{"name":"John McAllister","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McAllister","id":"37271866600"},{"name":"Yun Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37900633300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045472","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Program processors","Processor scheduling","Pipelines","Schedules","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","MIMO communication","parallel processing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel interleaved scheduling method","streaming applications","soft-core vector processors","massively parallel networks","single instruction multiple data processors","FPGA-based implementation","real-time signal processing applications","hardware architectures","simple datapath units","deep processing pipelines","pipeline bubbles","control hazards","manual interleaving","application tasks","automated integrated mapping-scheduling approach","low-complexity list scheduling technique","spatial fixed-complexity sphere decoding detector","next-generation multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO systems","IEEE 802.11 systems","SIMD processors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","SIMD Processor","Partition and Scheduling","Pipeline Hazard","Interleaving"]}],"abstract":"Massively parallel networks of highly efficient, high performance Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processors have been shown to enable FPGA-based implementation of real-time signal processing applications with performance and cost comparable to dedicated hardware architectures.

However, these architectures are highly susceptible to pipeline bubbles resulting from data and control hazards; the only way to mitigate against these is manual interleaving of application tasks on each datapath, since no suitable automated interleaving approach exists.

As an exposed datapath architecture, TTAs can effectively reduce the register file (RF) pressure in both number of accesses and number of RF ports. However, the conventional TTAs also have some evident disadvantages, such as relative low code density, dynamic-power wasting due to separate scheduling of source operands, and inefficient support for variant immediate values. In order to preserve the merit of conventional TTAs, while solving these aforementioned issues, we propose, MOVE-Pro, a novel low power and high code density TTA architecture. With optimizations at instruction set architecture (ISA), architecture, circuit, and compiler levels, the low-power potential of TTAs is fully exploited. Moreover, with a much denser code size, TTAs performance is also improved accordingly. In a head-to-head comparison between a two-issue MOVE-Pro processor and its RISC counterpart, we shown that up to 80% of RF accesses can be reduced, and the reduction in RF power is successfully transferred to the total core power saving. Up to 11% reduction of the total core power is achieved by our MOVE-Pro processor, while the code density is almost the same as its RISC counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045474","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045474.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOVE-Pro: A low power and high code density TTA architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045474/","displayDocTitle":"MOVE-Pro: A low power and high code density TTA architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12307867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045474/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOVE-Pro: A low power and high code density TTA architecture","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068031S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6045475,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045475","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045475","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Electronics industry","System performance","Resource management","Digital signal processors","Stacking"]}],"abstract":"Encouraged by the significant recent progress of 3D integration technologies, 3D integration has become a spotlight of global semiconductor industry.

Due to the memory-intensive nature of signal processing systems, DSPs can greatly benefit from 3D memory integration technology realized by vertically stacking high-density memory below processing cores. In this paper, we analyze the energy and performance impacts of 3D memory integration in DSP systems by exploring a wide variety of memory configurations the technology enables. Our analysis demonstrates that a 3D memory hierarchy can increase performance by an average of 20.6% while decreasing energy by 6.7% when compared to our baseline 2D memory hierarchy, with a processor similar to a Texas Instrument C67\u00d7 DSP. This proposed memory architecture also allows us to scale the voltage and frequency to decrease energy consumption by an average of 23% without decreasing performance.","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045476","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045476.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing the performance and energy impact of 3D memory integration on embedded DSPs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the performance and energy impact of 3D memory integration on embedded DSPs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045476/","publicationDate":"July 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12307868","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045476/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the performance and energy impact of 3D memory integration on embedded DSPs","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"PaperIEEESAMOSXI39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05314S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036614","isNumber":"6045429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036614","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6045429","articleId":"6045476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6045482,"authors":[{"name":"Nikola Tr\u010dka","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant, NL"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Tr\u010dka","id":"37077146100"},{"name":"Martijn Hendriks","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Martijn","lastName":"Hendriks","id":"37429178300"},{"name":"Twan Basten","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Twan","lastName":"Basten","id":"37298850600"},{"name":"Marc Geilen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Geilen","id":"37373827600"},{"name":"Lou Somers","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Lou","lastName":"Somers","id":"37354039100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0801-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0802-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045482","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Analytical models","Embedded systems","Printers","Adaptation models","Printing","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","embedded systems","software performance evaluation","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated model-driven design-space exploration","embedded system","reliability","energy efficiency","decision making","modeling abstraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045482","doi":"10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045429","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036614/6045429/06045482.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated model-driven design-space exploration for embedded systems","abstract":"Embedded systems and their design trajectories are becoming increasingly complex, and there is a growing demand for performance, reliability, energy efficiency and low cost.

Genetic algorithms are randomized search and optimisation techniques. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm clustering for color image quantization as a prior process to any other one for image analysis. A fitness function with a smallest number of variables is proposed. It's based on the fuzzy c-means objective function reformulated by Bezdek and the one proposed by Frigui and Krishnapuram in their competitive agglomeration algorithm. The proposed clustering genetic algorithm allows the initial population solutions to converge to good results in relatively less run-time. In addition, variable chromosome length is used to determine the clusters number.","doi":"10.1109/EuVIP.2011.6045508","startPage":"83","endPage":"87","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034619/6045493/06045508.pdf","publicationTitle":"3rd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuVIP.2011.6045508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm clustering for color image quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Quantization","Classification algorithms","Image color analysis","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","image classification","image colour analysis","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm clustering","color image quantization","unsupervised classification method","image analysis","randomized search","color image clustering","fitness function","fuzzy c-means objective function","competitive agglomeration algorithm","chromosome length"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clustering methods","Fuzzy","Quantization","image color analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm clustering for color image quantization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12316333","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm clustering for color image quantization","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"Paper11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156247S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034619","isNumber":"6045493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034619","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6045493","articleId":"6045508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6045528,"authors":[{"name":"Zaynab Ahmed","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Zaynab","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38311430600"},{"name":"Abir Jaafar Hussain","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Abir Jaafar","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37286675800"},{"name":"Dhiya Al-Jumeily","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Dhiya","lastName":"Al-Jumeily","id":"38271128600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0071-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0072-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0070-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6045528","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Motion estimation","Prediction algorithms","Diamond-like carbon","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulation","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image matching","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean predictive block matching","MPBM","block-matching motion estimation","adaptive rood pattern search algorithm","reference frame","uncompleted sum absolute value","macroblock matching","video compression","motion compensated video coding standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-matching algorithm","motion estimation","video compression"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new technique called Mean Predictive Block Matching (MPBM) is proposed. This technique is based on adaptive rood pattern search algorithm, in which the size is dynamically determined for each macroblock, based on the mean of two motion vectors of the neighboring macroblocks instead of one as is the case with adaptive rood patter search. The proposed technique attempts to decrease the computation time between the current macroblock and the macroblocks in the reference frame, by stopping the calculation of the sum absolute different between the pixels in the current and the reference frame macroblocks when the current uncompleted sum absolute value is greater than the previous calculated one. Experimental results showed that the proposed technique reduces the search time of the macroblock matching, as well as achieves better resolution for fast block motion estimation in comparison to the standard block matching algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/EuVIP.2011.6045528","publicationTitle":"3rd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034619/6045493/06045528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuVIP.2011.6045528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045493","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Predictive Block Matching (MPBM) for fast block-matching motion estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mean Predictive Block Matching (MPBM) for fast block-matching motion estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045528/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12316353","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6045528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Predictive Block Matching (MPBM) for fast block-matching motion estimation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"Paper53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061002S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034619","isNumber":"6045493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034619","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6045493","articleId":"6045528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6045685,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen W.

The stage is constructed with a very simple structure by employing double parallelogram flexures and four contactless electromagnetic force actuators. The kinematics and dynamic modeling of the mechanical system of the stage are conducted by resorting to compliance and stiffness analysis based on matrix method, and analytical models for electromagnetic forces are also established, both mechanical structure and electromagnetic model are validated by finite element analysis(FEA) via AN-SYS. The mechanical structure is analyzed in a multi-physics environmental simulation and electromagnetic actuators are applied in ANSYS too. Both FEA and the analytical models well demonstrate that the movement of the stage is totally decoupled.

They are changing dynamically as well due to the addition and removal of system components, changing execution environments, frequent updates and upgrades, online repairs and more. In such large-scale complex and dynamic systems, failures are common. In this paper, we present a failure prediction mechanism exploiting both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques for building dependable cloud computing systems. The unsupervised failure detection method uses an ensemble of Bayesian models. It characterizes normal execution states of the system and detects anomalous behaviors. After the anomalies are verified by system administrators, labeled data are available. Then, we apply supervised learning based on decision tree classier to predict future failure occurrences in the cloud. Experimental results in an institute-wide cloud computing system show that our proposed method can forecast failure dynamics with high accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045375/6045921/06045942.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","doi":"10.1109/ARES.2011.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2011.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6045942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Failure Management by Integrated Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Dependable Cloud Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Data models","Bayesian methods","Cloud computing","Mathematical model","Mutual information","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cloud computing","decision trees","pattern classification","system recovery","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive failure management","unsupervised learning","semi-supervised learning","dependable cloud computing systems","failure prediction mechanism","unsupervised failure detection method","Bayesian models","decision tree classier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud systems","Dependable systems","Learning algorithms","Bayesian detector","Decision tree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6045942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Failure Management by Integrated Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Dependable Cloud Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6045942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12325834","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Failure Management by Integrated Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Dependable Cloud Systems","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"4485a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08609S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045375","isNumber":"6045921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045375","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6045921","articleId":"6045942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6046003,"authors":[{"name":"Mete Akgun","affiliation":["T\u00fcbitak UEKAE, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mete","lastName":"Akgun","id":"38071215900"},{"name":"M.

Our solution is based on the use of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Although there are many proposals that addresses the security and privacy issues of RFID, the search efficiency still remains as a challenging issue. A first tree based mutual authentication scheme for RFID systems has been proposed by Molnar and Wagner to solve the search efficiency problem. The large communication overhead of this scheme has been reduced by Dimitriou performing the authentication with one message from the tag to the reader. However, tree-based schemes are vulnerable to tag compromising attack due to lack key-updating mechanism. Therefore, tree-based schemes are weak private in the Vaudenay-Model. In this paper, we present a tree-based authentication protocol for RFID systems that is destructive-private in the Vaudenay-Model.

throughput performance of a medium transparent medium access control (MAC) protocol in 60 GHz radio-over-fiber (RoF) networks. The proposed model incorporates effectively the medium transparent MAC mechanism, assuming a finite number of terminals and ideal channel conditions. It takes into account contention both at the optical and wireless layer, ensuring seamless and dynamic capacity allocation over both transmission media. This model enables extensive saturation throughput performance analysis for the medium transparent MAC and has been applied to 60 GHz RoF network scenarios considering variable numbers of available optical wavelengths, wireless nodes and serving antenna elements and for two different data rate values, namely 155 Mbps and 1 Gbps. Comparison between the model-based throughput results and respective simulation-based outcomes reveals that our model is extremely accurate in predicting the system throughput. Moreover, it confirms that the proposed medium transparent MAC protocol can effectively operate in high-speed 60 GHz RoF LAN environments.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2172392","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6093615/06046087.pdf","startPage":"3777","endPage":"3785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2172392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation Throughput Performance Analysis of a Medium Transparent MAC Protocol for 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saturation Throughput Performance Analysis of a Medium Transparent MAC Protocol for 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2011","volume":"29","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046087/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12403249","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation Throughput Performance Analysis of a Medium Transparent MAC Protocol for 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-kalfas-2172392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057601S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6093615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6093615","articleId":"6046087","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046102,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6058665/6046102/6046102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Michigan State University (MSU), East Lansing.

The developed system allows for much higher operating distances than leading ultra-wideband local positioning systems, while it provides the same or even better accuracy. This is achieved by a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) measurement concept that enables the receiving unit to control the beam patterns of the receiving and the transmitting antenna arrays by a coherent combination of the received signals. In this way, interfering multipath components are suppressed, leading to a significantly reduced ranging error. Furthermore, the angle of arrival and the angle of departure are determined from the MIMO datasets using super-resolution direction-finding techniques. For position determination, both range and angle information are exploited. Extensive measurements with the MIMO system in different indoor environments show that the position error can be reduced by up to 80% compared to an equivalent single-antenna setup.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2169079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097085/06046106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2169079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097085","startPage":"3228","endPage":"3238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable MIMO System for High-Precision FMCW Local Positioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable MIMO System for High-Precision FMCW Local Positioning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408765","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046106/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable MIMO System for High-Precision FMCW Local Positioning","sourcePdf":"tmtt-gierlich-2169079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136794S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6097085","articleId":"6046106","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046111,"authors":[{"name":"Mid-Eum Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6046111/6046111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mid-Eum Choi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, in 2008.

In order to offset their opposing limitations, an active battery/SC hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using a dc/dc converter has been proposed. The major problem concerning an active HESS is in how to control the current flow in order to achieve two objectives: the minimization of the magnitude/fluctuation of the current flowing in and out of the battery and the energy loss seen by the SCs. This problem has not been analytically investigated for an optimal solution regarding these two goals. In this paper, we present an optimal energy management scheme for active HESS. In order to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem concerning these two objectives. Observing that the feasibility and optimality of the solution critically depends on the boundary parameters of the problem, we present an algorithm that effectively adjusts the parameter values. The proposed algorithm is based on the multiplicative-increase- additive-decrease principle, which guarantees a feasible optimal solution. Through MATLAB simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can optimally minimize the magnitude/fluctuation of the battery current and the SC energy loss.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2164816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06046111.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2164816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Management Optimization in a Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management Optimization in a Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543437","htmlLink":"/document/6046111/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management Optimization in a Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tsg-choi-2164816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072682S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6046111","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6046114,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Barachant","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Barachant","id":"37601488000"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Bonnet","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Bonnet","id":"37417993100"},{"name":"Marco Congedo","affiliation":["GIPSA-Laboratory, CNRS, Grenoble University, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Congedo","id":"37281961000"},{"name":"Christian Jutten","affiliation":["GIPSA-Laboratory, CNRS, Grenoble University, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Jutten","id":"37284647800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6046114","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":288,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3997},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Manifolds","Symmetric matrices","Electroencephalography","Geometry","Silicon","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","matrix algebra","medical signal processing","signal classification","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass BCI classification","brain-computer interface","Riemannian geometry","classification framework","motor imagery","covariance matrix manifold","spatial covariance matrices","EEG signal descriptors","symmetric matrix manifold topology","positive definite matrix manifold topology","spatial information","multiclass common spatial pattern","CSP","linear discriminant analysis","minimum distance to Riemannian mean classification","MDRM classification algorithm","minimum distance to mean classification","MDM classification algorithm","Riemannian distance","tangent space LDA","TSLDA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain computer interfaces","classification algorithms","covariance matrix","electroencephalography","information geometry"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials, Motor","Humans","Imagination","Motor Cortex","Movement","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","User-Computer Interface"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new classification framework for brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery. This framework involves the concept of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed. This latter method outperforms the reference method increasing the mean classification accuracy from 65.1% to 70.2%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2172210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6170948/06046114.pdf","endPage":"928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass Brain\u2013Computer Interface Classification by Riemannian Geometry","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2172210","startPage":"920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass Brain\u2013Computer Interface Classification by Riemannian Geometry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046114/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12614948","pubMedId":"22010143","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6046114/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass Brain\u2013Computer Interface Classification by Riemannian Geometry","sourcePdf":"tbme-barachant-2172210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063572S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6170948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"6170948","articleId":"6046114","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6046125,"authors":[{"name":"Kelly Canham","affiliation":["Center of Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059695/6046125/6046125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kelly Canham received the B.S. degree in optics from the University of Arizona, Tucson.

In order to sufficiently spectrally unmix the data, three key steps must be accomplished: Estimate the number of endmembers (EMs), identify the EMs, and then unmix the data. Several different statistical and geometrical approaches have been developed for all steps of the unmixing process. However, many of these methods rely on using the full image to estimate the number and extract the EMs from the background data. In this paper, spectral unmixing is accomplished using a spatially adaptive approach. Linear unmixing is performed per pixel with EMs identified at the local level, but global abundance maps are created by clustering the locally determined EMs into common groups. Results show that the unmixing residual error of each pixel's spectrum from real data, estimated from the spatially adaptive methodology, is reduced when compared to a global scale EM estimation and linear unmixing methodology. The component algorithms of the new spatially adaptive approach, which complete the three key unmixing steps, can be interchanged while maintaining spatial information, making this new methodology modular. A final advantage of the spatially adaptive spectral unmixing methodology is the user-defined spatial scale size.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2169680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059695/06046125.pdf","startPage":"4248","endPage":"4262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2169680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Hyperspectral Unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046125/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Hyperspectral Unmixing","volume":"49","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317819","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046125/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Adaptive Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-canham-2169680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156099S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6059695","articleId":"6046125","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046130,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Rivera","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6180074/6046130/6046130-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Rivera (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics engineering, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile, in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 2011.","During January and February of 2010, he was a visiting Ph.D. student of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada, where he worked on predictive control applied on four-leg inverters.

Since this new computing technology requires users to entrust their valuable data to cloud providers, there have been increasing security and privacy concerns on outsourced data. Several schemes employing attribute-based encryption (ABE) have been proposed for access control of outsourced data in cloud computing; however, most of them suffer from inflexibility in implementing complex access control policies. In order to realize scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control of outsourced data in cloud computing, in this paper, we propose hierarchical attribute-set-based encryption (HASBE) by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-set-based encryption (ASBE) with a hierarchical structure of users. The proposed scheme not only achieves scalability due to its hierarchical structure, but also inherits flexibility and fine-grained access control in supporting compound attributes of ASBE. In addition, HASBE employs multiple value assignments for access expiration time to deal with user revocation more efficiently than existing schemes. We formally prove the security of HASBE based on security of the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme by Bethencourt and analyze its performance and computational complexity. We implement our scheme and show that it is both efficient and flexible in dealing with access control for outsourced data in cloud computing with comprehensive experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","volume":"7","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12578150","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6046132/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"HASBE: A Hierarchical Attribute-Based Solution for Flexible and Scalable Access Control in Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HASBE: A Hierarchical Attribute-Based Solution for Flexible and Scalable Access Control in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tifs-wan-2172209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104107S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6166811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"287","xplore-issue":"6166811","articleId":"6046132","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6046133,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuya Takeda","affiliation":["Department of Media Science, Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/6046133/6046133-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuya Takeda (SM'09) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering and the Dr. Eng. degree from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, in 1983, 1985, and 1994, respectively.","From 1986 to 1989, he was with the Advanced Telecommunication Research (ATR) Laboratories, Osaka, Japan.

Unlike previous data collection efforts, the corpora collected here contain both human and vehicle sensor data, together with rich and continuous transcriptions. While most efforts on in-vehicle research are generally focused within individual countries, this effort links a collaborative team from three diverse regions (i.e., Asia, American, and Europe). Details relating to the data collection paradigm, such as sensors, driver information, routes, and transcription protocols, are discussed, and a preliminary analysis of the data across the three data collection sites from the U.S. (Dallas), Japan (Nagoya), and Turkey (Istanbul) is provided. The usability of the corpora has been experimentally verified with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.74 for transcription reliability, as well as being successfully exploited for several in-vehicle applications. Most importantly, the corpora are publicly available for research use and represent one of the first multination efforts to share resources and understand driver characteristics. Future work on distributing the corpora to the wider research community is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2167680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2167680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082048","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1623","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6082048/06046133.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Road vehicles","Tagging","Human factors","Speech","Data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["international large-scale vehicle corpora","driver behavior","collaborative team","transcription reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driving behavior signal","on-road data collection","road vehicles","tagging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"International Large-Scale Vehicle Corpora for Research on Driver Behavior on the Road","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388595","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046133/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046133/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"International Large-Scale Vehicle Corpora for Research on Driver Behavior on the Road","sourcePdf":"tits-malta-2167680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10026S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6082048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6082048","articleId":"6046133","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6046134,"authors":[{"name":"Bennett A.

The process of image labeling is inherently error prone as images are corrupted by noise and artifacts. Even expert interpretations are subject to subjectivity and the precision of the individual raters. Hence, all labels must be considered imperfect with some degree of inherent variability. One may seek multiple independent assessments to both reduce this variability and quantify the degree of uncertainty. Existing techniques have exploited maximum a posteriori statistics to combine data from multiple raters and simultaneously estimate rater reliabilities. Although quite successful, wide-scale application has been hampered by unstable estimation with practical datasets, for example, with label sets with small or thin objects to be labeled or with partial or limited datasets. As well, these approaches have required each rater to generate a complete dataset, which is often impossible given both human foibles and the typical turnover rate of raters in a research or clinical environment. Herein, we propose a robust approach to improve estimation performance with small anatomical structures, allow for missing data, account for repeated label sets, and utilize training/catch trial data. With this approach, numerous raters can label small, overlapping portions of a large dataset, and rater heterogeneity can be robustly controlled while simultaneously estimating a single, reliable label set and characterizing uncertainty. The proposed approach enables many individuals to collaborate in the construction of large datasets for labeling tasks (e.g., human parallel processing) and reduces the otherwise detrimental impact of rater unavailability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12508944","pubMedId":"22010145","volume":"31","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6046134/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Statistical Fusion of Image Labels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Statistical Fusion of Image Labels","sourcePdf":"tmi-asman-2172215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104259S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6142636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6142636","articleId":"6046134","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6046135,"authors":[{"name":"David.

The scheme used to model the intelligent agent is a particular class of an adaptive neuro\u2013fuzzy inference system with piecewise multilinear behavior. The main characteristics of our model are computational efficiency, scalability, and universal approximation capability. Several online experiments have been performed with data obtained in a real ubiquitous computing environment test bed.

In this paper, we propose a new mutation strategy, a fitness- induced parent selection scheme for the binomial crossover of DE, and a simple but effective scheme of adapting two of its most important control parameters with an objective of achieving improved performance. The new mutation operator, which we call DE/current-to-gr_best/1, js a variant of the classical DE/current-to-best/1 scheme. It uses the best of a group (whose size is q% of the population size) of randomly selected solutions from current generation to perturb the parent (target) vector, unlike DE/current-to-best/1 that always picks the best vector of the entire population to perturb the target vector. In our modified framework of recombination, a biased parent selection scheme has been incorporated by letting each mutant undergo the usual binomial crossover with one of the p top-ranked individuals from the current population and not with the target vector with the same index as used in all variants of DE. A DE variant obtained by integrating the proposed mutation, crossover, and parameter adaptation strategies with the classical DE framework (developed in 1995) is compared with two classical and four state-of-the-art adaptive DE variants over 25 standard numerical benchmarks taken from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005 competition and special session on real parameter optimization. Our comparative study indicates that the proposed schemes improve the performance of DE by a large magnitude such that it becomes capable of enjoying statistical superiority over the state-of-the-art DE variants for a wide variety of test problems. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that, if one or more of our proposed strategies are integrated with existing powerful DE variants such as jDE and JADE, their performances can also be enhanced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046144/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592484","pubMedId":"22010153","volume":"42","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm With Novel Mutation and Crossover Strategies for Global Numerical Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm With Novel Mutation and Crossover Strategies for Global Numerical Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-suganthan-2167966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160769S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6169194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"403","xplore-issue":"6169194","articleId":"6046144","onlineDate":"14 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6046158,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih Alagoz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Fatih Alag\u00f6z (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1992 and the M.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the George Washington University, Washington, DC, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.

This paper describes a new method to determine the minimum precision required to meet a given error specification for an algorithm consisting of the basic algebraic operations. Using this approach, it is possible to significantly reduce the computational word-length in comparison to existing methods, and this can lead to superior hardware designs. We demonstrate the proposed procedure on an iteration of the conjugate gradient algorithm, achieving proofs of bounds that can translate to global word-length savings ranging from a few bits to proving the existence of ranges that must otherwise be assumed to be unbounded when using competing approaches. We also achieve comparable bounds to recent literature in a small fraction of the execution time, with greater scalability.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2161307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046164.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2161307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounding Variable Values and Round-Off Effects Using Handelman Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bounding Variable Values and Round-Off Effects Using Handelman Representations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300647","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046164/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounding Variable Values and Round-Off Effects Using Handelman Representations","sourcePdf":"tcad-boland-2161307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141694S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6046160","articleId":"6046164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046168,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37534638500"},{"name":"J.

First, real hotspots become hard to identify at early design stages and hard to fix at post-layout stages. Second, false alarms must be kept low to avoid excessive and expensive post-processing hotspot removal. Third, full chip physical verification and optimization require very fast turn-around time. Last but not least, rapid technology advancement favors generic hotspot detection methodologies to avoid exhaustive pattern enumeration and excessive development/update as technology evolves. To address the above issues, we propose a high performance hotspot detection methodology consisting of: 1) a fast layout analyzer; 2) powerful hotspot pattern identifiers; and 3) a generic and efficient flow with successive performance refinements. We implement our algorithms with industry-strength engine under real manufacturing conditions and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in false alarms (2.4X to 2300X reduction) and runtime (5X to 237X reduction), meanwhile achieving similar or better hotspot accuracies. Compared with pattern matching, our method achieves higher prediction accuracy for hotspots that are not previously characterized, therefore, more detection generality when exhaustive pattern enumeration is too expensive to perform a priori. Such high performance hotspot detection is especially suitable for lithography-friendly physical design.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046168.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Lithography Hotspot Detection With Successively Refined Pattern Identifications and Machine Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High Performance Lithography Hotspot Detection With Successively Refined Pattern Identifications and Machine Learning","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300651","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Lithography Hotspot Detection With Successively Refined Pattern Identifications and Machine Learning","sourcePdf":"tcad-ding-2164537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036133S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"43","articleId":"6046168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6046169,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqian Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6046160/6046169/6046169-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueqian Zhao received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.

Traditional decap budgeting algorithms usually explore the sensitivity-based nonlinear optimizations or conjugate gradient (CG) methods, which can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale decap budgeting problems and cannot be easily parallelized. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cross-entropy based optimization technique which is more efficient and parallel-friendly. Cross-entropy (CE) is an advanced optimization framework which explores the power of rare event probability theory and importance sampling. To achieve the high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross-entropy (SCE) algorithm is introduced which integrates CE with a partitioning-based sampling strategy to effectively reduce the solution space in solving the large-scale decap budgeting problems. Compared to improved CG method and conventional CE method, SCE with Latin hypercube sampling method (SCE-LHS) can provide 2\u00d7 speedups, while achieving up to 25% improvement on power supply noise. To further improve decap optimization solution quality, SCE with sequential importance sampling (SCE-SIS) method is also studied and implemented. Compared to SCE-LHS, in similar runtime, SCE-SIS can lead to 16.8% further reduction on the total power supply noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046169.pdf","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2162068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2162068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Cross-Entropy Optimization for Fast On-Chip Decap Budgeting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Noise measurement","Power supplies","Power grids","Monte Carlo methods","Entropy","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","conjugate gradient methods","entropy","nonlinear programming","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical cross-entropy optimization technique","fast on-chip decap budgeting","decoupling capacitor","dynamic power supply noise reduction","sensitivity-based nonlinear optimizations","conjugate gradient method","event probability theory","partitioning-based sampling strategy","Latin hypercube sampling method","sequential importance sampling method","SCE-SIS method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjoint sensitivity analysis","cross-entropy optimization","decoupling capacitor budgeting","power grid design","power supply noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Cross-Entropy Optimization for Fast On-Chip Decap Budgeting","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6046169/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300652","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Cross-Entropy Optimization for Fast On-Chip Decap Budgeting","sourcePdf":"tcad-feng-2162068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129865S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6046160","articleId":"6046169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046177,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Sheng Hou","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6046160/6046177/6046177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Sheng Hou received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 2006, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.","His current research interests include memory testing and repair."]},"firstName":"Chih-Sheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37401416100"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6046160/6046177/6046177-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Fu Li (S'01\u2013M'03) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, where he is currently a Full Professor and the Vice Chair.

Effective techniques for planning these BISR circuits thus are imperative. In this paper, we propose a memory BISR planning (MBiP) framework for the RAMs in SoCs. The MBiP framework consists of a memory grouping algorithm for selecting RAMs which can share a BISR circuit. Then, a test scheduling algorithm is used to determine the test sequence of RAMs in a SoC under the constraint of test power. Finally, a BISR scheme allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate different BISR schemes for the RAMs under the constraints of the results of memory grouping and test scheduling. Simulation results show that the proposed MBiP can effectively plan the BISR schemes for the RAMs in a SoC. For example, about 22% area reduction can be achieved by the BISR schemes planned by the proposed MBiP framework for 50 RAMs under 1.5 mm distance constraint and 350 mW test power constraint in comparison with a dedicated BISR scheme (i.e., each RAM has a self-contained BISR circuit).","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046177.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1743","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2160174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2160174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Built-in Self-Repair Planning Framework for RAMs in SoCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Memory Built-in Self-Repair Planning Framework for RAMs in SoCs","htmlLink":"/document/6046177/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12300656","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Built-in Self-Repair Planning Framework for RAMs in SoCs","sourcePdf":"tcad-li-2160174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09036S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6046160","articleId":"6046177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046180,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Noia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6046160/6046180/6046180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brandon Noia received the B.S.E. degree from Duke University, Durham, NC.

In this paper, we address test architecture optimization for 3-D stacked ICs implemented using TSVs. We consider two cases, namely 3-D SICs with die-level test architectures that are either fixed or still need to be designed. We next present mathematical programming techniques to derive optimal solutions for the architecture optimization problem for both cases. Experimental results for three handcrafted 3-D SICs comprising of various systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) from the ITC'02 SoC test benchmarks show that compared to the baseline method of sequentially testing all dies, the proposed solutions can achieve significant reduction in test length. This is achieved through optimal test schedules enabled by the test architecture. We also show that increasing the number of test pins typically provides a greater reduction in test length compared to an increase in the number of test TSVs. Furthermore, we show that shorter test lengths are generally achieved with the larger, more complex dies lower in the stack. This is because test data must pass through every die lower in a stack in order to reach its target die, and with the larger dies lower in the stack, more test bandwidth may be provided to these dies using fewer routing resources.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2160177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2160177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test-Architecture Optimization and Test Scheduling for TSV-Based 3-D Stacked ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test-Architecture Optimization and Test Scheduling for TSV-Based 3-D Stacked ICs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300659","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046180/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test-Architecture Optimization and Test Scheduling for TSV-Based 3-D Stacked ICs","sourcePdf":"tcad-noia-2160177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161103S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6046160","articleId":"6046180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6046183,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Hanumaiah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona, State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6046160/6046183/6046183-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vinay Hanumaiah (S'08) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the M.

In contrast to offline thermal management techniques, online techniques are capable of sensing changes in the workload distribution and setting the processor controls accordingly. Hence, online solutions are more accurate and are able to extract higher performance than the offline techniques. This paper presents performance optimal online thermal management techniques for multicore processors. The techniques include dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and task-to-core allocation or task migration. The problem formulation includes accurate power and thermal models, as well as leakage dependence on temperature. This paper provides a theoretical basis for deriving the optimal policies and computationally efficient implementations. The effectiveness of our DVFS and task-to-core allocation techniques are demonstrated by numerical simulations. The proposed task-to-core allocation method showed a 20.2% improvement in performance over a power-based thread migration approach. The techniques have been incorporated in a thermal-aware architectural-level simulator called MAGMA that allows for design space exploration, offline, and online dynamic thermal management. The simulator is capable of handling simulations of hundreds of cores within reasonable time.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2161308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6046160/06046183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2161308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1677","endPage":"1690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Optimal Online DVFS and Task Migration Techniques for Thermally Constrained Multi-Core Processors","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6046183/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12300662","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Optimal Online DVFS and Task Migration Techniques for Thermally Constrained Multi-Core Processors","sourcePdf":"tcad-vrudhula-2161308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102884S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6046160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6046160","articleId":"6046183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":6046220,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander V.

The NFS, after training with machine condition data, is employed as a prognostic model to forecast the evolution of the machine fault state with time. An online model update scheme is developed on the basis of the probability density function (PDF) of the NFS residuals between the actual and predicted condition data. Bayesian estimation algorithms adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set of random samples (or particles) with associated weights. When new data become available, the weights of all particles are updated, and then, predictions are carried out, which form the PDF of the predicted estimations. The developed method is evaluated via two experimental cases-a cracked carrier plate and a faulty bearing. The prediction performance is compared with three prevalent machine condition predictors-recurrent neural networks, NFSs, and recurrent NFSs. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict machine conditions more accurately.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2169182","startPage":"297","endPage":"306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2169182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6119253/06046227.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Machine Health Condition Using Neuro-Fuzzy and Bayesian Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046227/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Machine Health Condition Using Neuro-Fuzzy and Bayesian Algorithms","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6046227/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12438054","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Machine Health Condition Using Neuro-Fuzzy and Bayesian Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tim-chen-2169182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101987S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6119253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6119253","articleId":"6046227","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6046231,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Yuan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099846/6046231/6046231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Yuan Yeh was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1971.

A fuzzy neural network is constructed accordingly and the associated parameters are refined by a hybrid learning algorithm which incorporates particle swarm optimization and a least squares estimation. For a new input, a corresponding crisp output of the system is obtained by combining the inferred results of all the rules into a type-2 fuzzy set, which is then defuzzified by applying a refined type reduction algorithm.

Gated clock tree is an effective approach to reduce the dynamic power usage. In this paper, two novel gated clock tree synthesizers, power-aware clock tree synthesizer (PACTS) and power- and slew-aware clock tree synthesizer (PSACTS), are proposed with zero skew achieved based on Elmore RC model. In PACTS, the topology of the clock tree is constructed with simultaneous buffer/gate insertion, which reduces the switched capacitance. In PSACTS, a more practical clock slew constraint is applied. Compared to previous works, clock tree synthesis is done first and followed by the insertions of clock gates. The clock slew changes a lot after the insertions of clock gates in real cases. In our work, the clock tree is constructed simultaneously with the insertions of clock gates. This ensures the limitation of the clock slew can be strictly satisfied while the limitation of the clock slew is always applied in the real design. The experimental results show that the power cost of our work is smaller and the runtime is reduced. The slew rate constraint is satisfied with a small clock skew from SPICE estimation. Generally, our work has better performance, improved efficiency and is more practical to be applied in the industry.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2168834","startPage":"2094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6252108/06046234.pdf","endPage":"2103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6252108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2168834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046234/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Power- and Slew-Aware Gated Clock Tree Synthesis","volume":"20","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6046234/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12884080","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Power- and Slew-Aware Gated Clock Tree Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sham-2168834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080049S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6046234","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6046235,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["Circuit and System Research, Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37599692700"},{"name":"Dinesh Somasekhar","affiliation":["Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Somasekhar","id":"37285025700"},{"name":"Shih-Lien Lu","affiliation":["Circuit and System Research, Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Shih-Lien","lastName":"Lu","id":"38184308200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6046235","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046235","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Arrays","Hamming distance","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information code","error-correcting codes","computing system","matching entry","cache tag array lookup","translation look-aside buffer matching","ECC","decoding","cache tag array look-up","gate count reduction","latency reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data comparison","error correcting code (ECC)","Hamming distance","set associative cache","tag array lookup"]}],"abstract":"There are situations in a computing system where incoming information needs to be compared with a piece of stored data to locate the matching entry, e.g., cache tag array lookup and translation look-aside buffer matching. If the stored data is protected with error-correcting codes (ECC) for reliability reason, the previous solution is to access the stored information, decode and correct if necessary before it is used to compare with the incoming data. The decoding and correcting step increases the total access time, which is often critical. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the compare latency for information encoded with ECC.

There are a number of publications on the performance of MIMO radar systems so that their advantages/disadvantages against conventional electronic steered arrays have been investigated in details. However, no publications focus on the way of synthesizing an arbitrary array through appropriate transmit and receive arrays. Consequently this paper describes a method to find all the possible decompositions of an arbitrary linear antenna array into transmit and receive arrays employing the MIMO radar technique. In particular, this is achieved through a polynomial approach to array decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2011.6046337","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036400/6046273/06046337.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2011.6046337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar topology: A systematic approach to the placement of the antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046337/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar topology: A systematic approach to the placement of the antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12315367","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046337/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar topology: A systematic approach to the placement of the antennas","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04003S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036400","isNumber":"6046273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036400","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6046273","articleId":"6046337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6046367,"authors":[{"name":"Warren P. du Plessis","affiliation":["DPSS, CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Warren P.","lastName":"du Plessis","id":"37580530500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-978-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-976-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6046367","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Decision support systems","Optimization","Planar arrays","Chebyshev approximation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale thinned arrays","density-taper","genetic algorithm","SLL value"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046367","abstract":"The use of the density-taper approach to initialize a genetic algorithm is shown to give excellent results in the synthesis of thinned arrays.

We concentrate over 90% of the microwave power for the wireless power transmission, which means the accuracy of the microwave beam is below 0.0001 degree in condition that the shape of the huge phased array can not stabilized in space. For the high accurate beam forming and target detecting, we choose the new method called PAC (Position and Angle Correction) which was proposed for the panel-structure phased array of the SPS.

As a result, directly extending the 1D-MAP to include inhomogeneous plane waves is numerically very inefficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036400/6046273/06046462.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"924","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2011.6046462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2011.6046462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposed perfectly matched stratified medium FDTD TFSF sourced by inhomogeneous plane waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Equations","Dispersion","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","inhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stratified medium FDTD TFSF","inhomogeneous plane wave","1D-MAP methodology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A proposed perfectly matched stratified medium FDTD TFSF sourced by inhomogeneous plane waves","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12315484","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed perfectly matched stratified medium FDTD TFSF sourced by inhomogeneous plane waves","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074888S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036400","isNumber":"6046273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6046273","articleId":"6046462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6046481,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Similar algorithm can be used in man-made systems like autonomous robots or safety systems in vehicles for detecting objects approaching on collision course. In this article usage of LGMD-based algorithms in road vehicles is investigated and a new solution is proposed. Video stream recorded from a moving vehicle inherently contains a lot of movement of the background due to vibrations and due to turning of the vehicle. This cause high output of LGMD and could trigger false alarms. The new approach, proposed in this article, enhances LGMD information and adds estimated expansion of objects in X and Y direction. Combination of all three sources of information gives a very good estimate of risk of collision. The new algorithm was developed using a reference set of test videos, where only one parameter was changed. Algorithm was tested with videos recorded from a moving vehicle in normal traffic and on the test ground, including real collisions in carton target at different speeds.

A basis persuit denoising technique, using Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs), combined with a sampling technique inspired by compressive sensing allows data to be recovered even when the link is interrupted for short intervals.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046748","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046748.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving link quality of UWB communication links by means of PSWF-Basis persuit denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046748/","displayDocTitle":"Improving link quality of UWB communication links by means of PSWF-Basis persuit denoising","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307546","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046748/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving link quality of UWB communication links by means of PSWF-Basis persuit denoising","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057309S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036399","isNumber":"6046731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036399","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6046731","articleId":"6046748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6046751,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This has allowed the gathering of data for a range of distances and antenna heights, including beyond horizon conditions and antennas below and above the clutter. The data has been compared with predictions using two different path loss models that are commonly used for interference predictions. The analysis shows that these models are very useful for higher antenna heights but that they tend to over-predict the interference for lower antenna heights.

We propose a cognitive radio node that is capable of resolving simultaneously frequency and spatial resources with the help of a multi-band direction-sensitive antenna, a commercial wideband transceiver, and energy detection. The antenna system is resonant at three selectable frequency bands and divides space in three switchable sectors d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n, and d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n, hence providing nine degrees of freedom altogether. The proposed CR node is tested in an Over-The-Air test setup consisting of eight transmit antennas placed around the node in a circular arrangement. The transmit antennas are fed with unique wideband signals at different center frequencies, emulating the activities of eight static primary users. The proposed CR node is used to sense frequency/direction spectrum utilization using energy detection.

To describe the small scale fading observed in the measured channel, the model makes use of three parameters, which respectively represent the mean LOS, specular reflected and diffuse multipath signals. The model is validated by comparing the CDF plots of the received signal power and eigenvalues with that of the measured channel. Furthermore, the effects of channel correlation on the capacities of equal power allocation MIMO and dual circular polarization multiplexing (DCPM) is investigated. It is found that only the capacity of the LOS-friendly DCPM is negatively affected by a reduction in channel correlation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046797.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"784","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel characteristics analysis of the dual circular polarized land mobile satellite MIMO radio channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Least squares approximation","Satellites","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Satellite broadcasting","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile satellite communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel characteristics analysis","dual circular polarized land mobile satellite MIMO radio channel","fading channel","specular reflected signal","diffuse multipath signal","CDF plot","received signal power","eigenvalues","measured channel","channel correlation","equal power allocation MIMO","dual circular polarization multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel characteristics analysis of the dual circular polarized land mobile satellite MIMO radio channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307591","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel characteristics analysis of the dual circular polarized land mobile satellite MIMO radio channel","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051641S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036399","isNumber":"6046731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036399","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6046731","articleId":"6046797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6046801,"authors":[{"name":"Yoke Leen Sit","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Yoke Leen","lastName":"Sit","id":"37720831600"},{"name":"Christian Sturm","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Sturm","id":"37318611700"},{"name":"Lars Reichardt","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Reichardt","id":"37318943500"},{"name":"Werner Wiesbeck","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Wiesbeck","id":"37281044700"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0048-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0046-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0047-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6046801","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":474},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler effect","Ray tracing","Doppler radar","Radar imaging","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler measurement","Doppler radar","estimation theory","OFDM modulation","radar imaging","ray tracing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-based range estimation algorithm","OFDM-based Doppler estimation algorithm","validation method","simulation method","OFDM communication system","OFDM radar system","Doppler measurement","ray-tracing technique","geometrical-optics","wave propagation","MATLAB","radar imaging"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a simulation and validation method using ray-tracing for an OFDM joint radar and communication system is presented. The motivation is to verify the range and Doppler estimation algorithm and to observe the behaviour of the OFDM radar system in a real scenario where there are multipath and multiusers in its environment. The OFDM radar system has only been performance verified for a single user and since Doppler measurement is not easily repeatable, it is thus unreliable to use measurement verification for performance observation purposes of a real scenario. Hence a ray-tracing technique based on geometrical-optics is used where the wave propagation, material parameters and traffic are modeled according to realistic environments. The ray-tracing results are then exported into the OFDM radar system's model on MATLAB and the result is observed from the radar image where the set distance and velocity are compared to those processed with the novel range and Doppler estimation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046801","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046801.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification of an OFDM-based range and Doppler estimation algorithm with ray-tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046801/","displayDocTitle":"Verification of an OFDM-based range and Doppler estimation algorithm with ray-tracing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307595","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6046801/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification of an OFDM-based range and Doppler estimation algorithm with ray-tracing","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08723S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036399","isNumber":"6046731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036399","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6046731","articleId":"6046801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6046806,"authors":[{"name":"Chinwe C.

Electromagnetic advantages result from being able to add inclusions with different electrical properties into the host substrate and thereby create a new effective permittivity and permeability. This paper will review and analyse methods for calculating these effective properties.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046806","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046806.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","startPage":"843","endPage":"846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave antennas and heterogeneous substrates using nanomaterial fabrication techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave antennas and heterogeneous substrates using nanomaterial fabrication techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046806/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307600","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave antennas and heterogeneous substrates using nanomaterial fabrication techniques","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067536S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036399","isNumber":"6046731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036399","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6046731","articleId":"6046806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6046809,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Garello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Garello","id":"37273243900"},{"name":"Yifan Jia","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Jia","id":"37893999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0048-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0046-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0047-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6046809","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Sensors","Noise level","Probability","Simulation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","probability","quadrature phase shift keying","signal detection","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing method","cognitive radio","spectrum sensing algorithm","signal to noise ratio","energy detection","cyclostationary detection","eigenvalue based detection","sensing slots","modified hybrid algorithm","QPSK primary signal","ROC curves","SNR gain","auxiliary gain","pre-defined false alarm probability","detection probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","signal detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of spectrum sensing methods for cognitive radio under low SNR","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","endPage":"889","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046809","startPage":"886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046809","abstract":"In this paper we compare several popular and top performing spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio under low signal to noise ratio scenario, namely the Energy Detection, the Cyclostationary Detection, and the Eigenvalue based Detection.

Based on this observation, a recently proposed \u201cMassive MIMO\u201d scheme was shown to achieve unprecedented system spectral efficiency using a very simple beamforming scheme and a very large number of base station antennas per active user per cell. In this work, we consider a more sophisticated system design that partition the users' population in geographically determined \u201cbins\u201d and for each bin selects the best scheme in a family of network- MIMO schemes defined by the type of linear beamforming, cooperation among base stations, frequency reuse, pilot reuse and user loading factors. The spectral efficiency obtained by the proposed architecture is similar to that achieved by \u201cMassive MIMO\u201d, with a 10-fold reduction in the number of antennas at the base stations (roughly, from 500 to 50 antennas).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2011.6046845","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036399/6046731/06046845.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1349","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2011.6046845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving large spectral efficiency with TDD and not-so-many base-station antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Achieving large spectral efficiency with TDD and not-so-many base-station antennas","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6046845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12307636","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6046845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving large spectral efficiency with TDD and not-so-many base-station antennas","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051284S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036399","isNumber":"6046731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036399","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6046731","articleId":"6046845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6046881,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Xiao","affiliation":["Research Center of Logistics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37674908800"},{"name":"Zhen Cheng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37534686800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1092-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6046881","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Algorithm design and analysis","DNA computing","Optimization","Encoding","Search problems","Thermodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","evolutionary computation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA sequences optimization","gravitational search algorithm","reliable DNA computing","logical constraints","chemical constraints","physical constraints","evolutionary algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA sequences design","Gravitational search algorithm","DNA computing"]}],"abstract":"In DNA computing, the design of DNA sequences is one of the most important practical and important research topics.

That is quit challenging because there are a lot more dimensions to consider than costs and flexibility. Moreover, the selection process is complicated by a number of new entrants as well as offers of non-transparent services, which sometimes differ significantly. In this paper, target dimensions for cloud computing were developed, based on an international literature analysis and interviews with experts. In special, they have been explained using Infrastructure as a Service here. These dimensions should help enterprises to become clear about their requirements on cloud computing and do further steps, like classifying appropriate providers.

Our motivation is trying to propose a new idea and method on trust management in cloud computing and further studies are still required to justify the rationality and practicability of this model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust Management Model to Enhance Security of Cloud Computing Environments","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Networking and Distributed Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICNDC.2011.56","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Networking and Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046210/6047030/06047143.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNDC.2011.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Trust Management Model to Enhance Security of Cloud Computing Environments","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047143/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12308735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust Management Model to Enhance Security of Cloud Computing Environments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4427a244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088243S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046210","isNumber":"6047030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046210","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6047030","articleId":"6047143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047190,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Fang","affiliation":["Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jianbin","lastName":"Fang","id":"37893317800"},{"name":"Ana Lucia Varbanescu","affiliation":["Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ana Lucia","lastName":"Varbanescu","id":"37698034900"},{"name":"Henk Sips","affiliation":["Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Sips","id":"37319521200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1336-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4510-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047190","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":120,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Benchmark testing","Programming","Performance evaluation","Computational modeling","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","parallel programming","parallelising compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance comparison","CUDA","performance gap","programming model","optimization strategy","architectural detail","compilers","OpenCL portability","NVIDIA GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance Comparison","CUDA","OpenCL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047190","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046213/6047040/06047190.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.45","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2011.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047040","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Performance Comparison of CUDA and OpenCL","abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive performance comparison between CUDA and OpenCL. We have selected 16 benchmarks ranging from synthetic applications to real-world ones. We make an extensive analysis of the performance gaps taking into account programming models, ptimization strategies, architectural details, and underlying compilers. Our results show that, for most applications, CUDA performs at most 30% better than OpenCL. We also show that this difference is due to unfair comparisons: in fact, OpenCL can achieve similar performance to CUDA under a fair comparison. Therefore, we define a fair comparison of the two types of applications, providing guidelines for more potential analyses. We also investigate OpenCL's portability by running the benchmarks on other prevailing platforms with minor modifications. Overall, we conclude that OpenCL's portability does not fundamentally affect its performance, and OpenCL can be a good alternative to CUDA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047190/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12316215","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047190/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Performance Comparison of CUDA and OpenCL","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Performance Comparison of CUDA and OpenCL","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083765S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047198,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo N.

However, there are significant problems that exist with regard to efficient provisioning and delivery of applications using Cloud-based IT resources. These barriers concern various levels such as workload modeling, virtualization, performance modeling, deployment, and monitoring of applications on virtualized IT resources. If these problems can be solved, then applications can operate more efficiently, with reduced financial and environmental costs, reduced under-utilization of resources, and better performance at times of peak load. In this paper, we present a provisioning technique that automatically adapts to workload changes related to applications for facilitating the adaptive management of system and offering end-users guaranteed Quality of Services (QoS) in large, autonomous, and highly dynamic environments. We model the behavior and performance of applications and Cloud-based IT resources to adaptively serve end-user requests. To improve the efficiency of the system, we use analytical performance (queueing network system model) and workload information to supply intelligent input about system requirements to an application provisioner with limited information about the physical infrastructure. Our simulation-based experimental results using production workload models indicate that the proposed provisioning technique detects changes in workload intensity (arrival pattern, resource demands) that occur over time and allocates multiple virtualized IT resources accordingly to achieve application QoS targets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Load

a critical issue. MapReduce provides a framework for large data processing and is shown to be scalable and fault-tolerant on commondity machines. However, it has higher learning curve than SQL-like language and the codes are hard to maintain and reuse. On the other hand, traditional SQL-based data processing is familiar to user but is limited in scalability. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to fill the gap between SQL-based and MapReduce data processing. We develop a data management system for cloud, named SQLMR. SQLMR complies SQL-like queries to a sequence of MapReduce jobs. Existing SQL-based applications are compatible seamlessly with SQLMR and users can manage Tera to PataByte scale of data with SQL-like queries instead of writing MapReduce codes. We also devise a number of optimization techniques to improve the performance of SQLMR. The experiment results demonstrate both performance and scalability advantage of SQLMR compared to MySQL and two NoSQL data processing systems, Hive and HadoopDB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316225","htmlLink":"/document/6047200/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SQLMR : A Scalable Database Management System for Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SQLMR : A Scalable Database Management System for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089484S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6047220,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37897698700"},{"name":"Roger D.

Although many efforts have been undertaken to improve the performance of such nested loops, for large data sets they still lag far behind synthetic benchmark performance. The state-of-art automatic locality optimizer PluTo achieves 3.7 GFLOPS for the above stencil, whereas a parallel benchmark executing the inner stencil computation directly on registers performs at 25.1 GFLOPS. In comparison, our algorithm achieves 13.0 GFLOPS (52% of the stencil peak benchmark).We present results for 2D and 3D domains in double precision including problems with gigabyte large data sets. The results are compared against hand-optimized naive schemes, PluTo, the stencil peak benchmark and results from literature. For constant stencils of slope one we break the dependence on the low system bandwidth and achieve at least 50% of the stencil peak, thus performing within a factor two of an ideal system with infinite bandwidth (the benchmark runs on registers without memory access). For large stencils and banded matrices the additional data transfers let the limitations of the system bandwidth come into play again, however, our algorithm still gains a large improvement over the other schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046213/6047040/06047225.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2011.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache Accurate Time Skewing in Iterative Stencil Computations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Diamond-like carbon","Instruction sets","Three dimensional displays","Cats","Synchronization","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","electronic data interchange","iterative methods","mathematics computing","multiprocessing systems","natural sciences computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache accurate time skewing","iterative stencil computations","completely memory bound algorithm","quad core Xeon X5482","hand vectorized naive 7-point stencil implementation","parallelized naive 7-point stencil implementation","system memory bandwidth limits","PluTo","automatic locality optimizer","stencil peak benchmark","data transfers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memory wall","memory bound","stencil","banded matrix","time skewing","temporal blocking","wavefront"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cache Accurate Time Skewing in Iterative Stencil Computations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316250","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Accurate Time Skewing in Iterative Stencil Computations","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066135S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047229,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Kumar Matam","affiliation":["CSTAR, IIIT-Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Kiran Kumar","lastName":"Matam","id":"37892051900"},{"name":"Kishore Kothapalli","affiliation":["CSTAR, IIIT-Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Kishore","lastName":"Kothapalli","id":"37321974500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1336-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4510-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047229","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Instruction sets","Kernel","Graphics processing unit","Data structures","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","iterative methods","mathematics computing","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse matrix vector multiplication","iterative method","graphics processing unit","linear algebra kernel","data structure","Nvidia Tesla GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication","Iterative Methods","GPGPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047229","abstract":"Multiplying a sparse matrix with a vector (spmv for short) is a fundamental operation in many linear algebra kernels. Having an efficient spmv kernel on modern architectures such as the GPUs is therefore of principal interest. The computational challenges that spmv poses are significantlydifferent compared to that of the dense linear algebra kernels. Recent work in this direction has focused on designing data structures to represent sparse matrices so as to improve theefficiency of spmv kernels. However, as the nature of sparseness differs across sparse matrices, there is no clear answer as to which data structure to use given a sparse matrix. In this work, we address this problem by devising techniques to understand the nature of the sparse matrix and then choose appropriate data structures accordingly. By using our technique, we are able to improve the performance of the spmv kernel on an Nvidia Tesla GPU (C1060) by a factor of up to80% in some instances, and about 25% on average compared to the best results of Bell and Garland [3] on the standard dataset (cf. Williams et al. SC'07) used in recent literature. We also use our spmv in the conjugate gradient method and show an average 20% improvement compared to using HYB spmv of [3], on the dataset obtained from the The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection [9].","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2011.82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.82","startPage":"612","endPage":"621","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046213/6047040/06047229.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication in Iterative Methods Using GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication in Iterative Methods Using GPU","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047229/","accessionNumber":"12316254","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047229/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication in Iterative Methods Using GPU","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108709S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6047233,"authors":[{"name":"Sagnak Tasirlar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sagnak","lastName":"Tasirlar","id":"37086204666"},{"name":"Vivek Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37389286300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1336-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4510-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047233","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Synchronization","Java","Runtime","Dynamic scheduling","Program processors","Containers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel programming","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven tasks","dynamic task parallelism","many-core processors","runtime scheduler","parallel programming model","fork-join structures","task graph structures","data-driven futures","dynamic single-assignment rule","scheduling algorithms","put () operation","fine-grain blocking","delayed async","multicore platforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Task parallelism","dataflow","task scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047233","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2011.87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047040","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046213/6047040/06047233.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Tasks and Their Implementation","abstract":"Dynamic task parallelism has been identified as a prerequisite for improving productivity and performance on future many-core processors. In dynamic task parallelism, computations are created dynamically and the runtime scheduler is responsible for scheduling the computations across processor cores. The sets of task graphs that can be supported by a dynamic scheduler depend on the underlying task primitives in the parallel programming model, with various classes of fork-join structures used most often in practice. However, many researchers have advocated the benefits of more general task graph structures, and have shown that the use of these task graph structures can lead to improved performance. In this paper, we propose an extension to task parallelism called Data-Driven Tasks (DDTs) that can be used to create arbitrary task graph structures. Unlike a normal task that starts execution upon creation, a DDT specifies its input constraints in an await clause containing a list of Data-Driven Futures (DDFs). A DDF can be viewed as a container with a full/empty state that obeys a dynamic single-assignment rule. The runtime scheduler will then ensure that a task is only scheduled when all the DDFs in its await clause become available (full). There is no constraint on which task performs a put() operation on a DDF. We describe five scheduling algorithms (Coarse-Grain Blocking, Fine-Grain Blocking, Delayed Async, Rollback & Replay, Data-Driven) that can be used to implement DDTs, and include performance evaluations of these five algorithms on a variety of benchmark programs and multi-core platforms. Our results show that the Data-Driven scheduler is the best approach for implementing DDTs, both from the viewpoints of memory efficiency and scalable parallelism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047233/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316258","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Tasks and Their Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Tasks and Their Implementation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080759S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6047242,"authors":[{"name":"Jithin Jose","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jithin","lastName":"Jose","id":"37890118700"},{"name":"Hari Subramoni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Subramoni","id":"37393051700"},{"name":"Miao Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37890682300"},{"name":"Minjia Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Minjia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088684953"},{"name":"Jian Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37900674100"},{"name":"Md.

It is used widely in the data-center environment for caching results of database calls, API calls or any other data. Using Memcached, spare memory in data-center servers can be aggregated to speed up lookups of frequently accessed information. The performance of Memcached is directly related to the underlying networking technology, as workloads are often latency sensitive. The existing Memcached implementation is built upon BSD Sockets interface. Sockets offers byte-stream oriented semantics. Therefore, using Sockets, there is a conversion between Memcached's memory-object semantics and Socket's byte-stream semantics, imposing an overhead. This is in addition to any extra memory copies in the Sockets implementation within the OS. Over the past decade, high performance interconnects have employed Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology to provide excellent performance for the scientific computation domain. In addition to its high raw performance, the memory-based semantics of RDMA fits very well with Memcached's memory-object model. While the Sockets interface can be ported to use RDMA, it is not very efficient when compared with low-level RDMA APIs. In this paper, we describe a novel design of Memcached for RDMA capable networks. Our design extends the existing open-source Memcached software and makes it RDMA capable. We provide a detailed performance comparison of our Memcached design compared to unmodified Memcached using Sockets over RDMA and 10 Gigabit Ethernet network with hardware-accelerated TCP/IP. Our performance evaluation reveals that latency of Memcached Get of 4 KB size can be brought down to 12 \u03bcs using ConnectX InfiniBand QDR adapters. Latency of the same operation using older generation DDR adapters is about 20 \u03bcs. These numbers are about a factor of four better than the performance obtained by using 10 GigE with TCP Offload. In addition, these latencies of Get requests over a range of message sizes are better by a factor of five to ten compared to IP over InfiniBand and Sockets Direct Protocol over InfiniBand. Further, throughput of small Get operations can be improved by a factor of six when compared to Sockets over 10 Gigabit Ethernet network. Similar factor of six improvement in throughput is observed over Sockets Direct Protocol using ConnectX QDR adapters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such memcached design on high performance RDMA capable interconnects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047040","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046213/6047040/06047242.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2011.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.37","startPage":"743","endPage":"752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memcached Design on High Performance RDMA Capable Interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047242/","displayDocTitle":"Memcached Design on High Performance RDMA Capable Interconnects","htmlLink":"/document/6047242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12316267","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memcached Design on High Performance RDMA Capable Interconnects","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4510a743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066967S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046213","isNumber":"6047040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046213","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6047040","articleId":"6047242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047243,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang-Kuo Tang","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Kuo","lastName":"Tang","id":"37894791500"},{"name":"Parmesh Ramanathan","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Parmesh","lastName":"Ramanathan","id":"37283225000"},{"name":"Katherine Compton","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Compton","id":"37299340000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1336-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4510-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047243","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Schedules","Program processors","Dynamic scheduling","Real time systems","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time systems","resource allocation","scheduling","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft aperiodic real-time task scheduling","hard periodic real-time task scheduling","heterogeneous compute resources","system-on-a-chip architectures","slack distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RTOS","real-time","scheduling","multi-core","multiprocessor","heterogeneous","multi-resource"]}],"abstract":"Effectively scheduling tasks on heterogeneous resources is critical to maximizing the overall benefit of those resources in system-on-a-chip architectures.

However, the required level of accuracy is far beyond current commercial positioning solutions, e.g., outdoor GPS and indoor RF systems. In this paper, we propose an AR-based positioning technique for AR users to position their locations. First, by utilizing a coarse positioning system, AR objects can be roughly displayed on the touch screen of a AR device. Then, AR objects can be matched with their images on the display via drag-and-drop operations by users. Thus, both the coordinates of the AR objects in the image and in the real world can be known. Based on the coordinates along with the knowledge of the camera focal length, the location at which the photograph was taken can be known. The location of the camera can be treated as the location of the user. The proposed positioning technique is very helpful in developing high-precision PNSs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Lenses","Measurement by laser beam","Databases","Silicon","Smart phones","Charge coupled devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AR-based positioning","augmented reality","pedestrian navigation systems","touch screen","drag-and-drop operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positioning","augmented reality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.48","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047276.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AR-Based Positioning for Mobile Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AR-Based Positioning for Mobile Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047276/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047276/","accessionNumber":"12316042","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AR-Based Positioning for Mobile Devices","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053377S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6047277,"authors":[{"name":"Jou-Chih Chang","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jou-Chih","lastName":"Chang","id":"37899863900"},{"name":"Pi-Shih Wang","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pi-Shih","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899705500"},{"name":"Kang-Hsuan Fan","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kang-Hsuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37891352300"},{"name":"Shih-Rong Yang","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Rong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37898678900"},{"name":"De-Yuan Su","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"De-Yuan","lastName":"Su","id":"37898047700"},{"name":"Min-Shiung Lin","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Shiung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37897573500"},{"name":"Min-Te Sun","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Te","lastName":"Sun","id":"37335450300"},{"name":"Yu-Chee Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chee","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37276276400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047277","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Global Positioning System","Servers","Sensors","Cameras","Wireless sensor networks","Communities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","public administration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iMace","female protection","violent offenders","sexual offenders","Smartphones","personal safety","sexual attacks","wireless networking techniques","rescue seeking mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless networks","smartphones","personal safety"]}],"abstract":"Personal safety in a community is an important issue.

Such a fast response to attacks can eventually lead to a safer and better community.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.57","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iMace: Protecting Females from Sexual and Violent Offenders in a Community via Smartphones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"iMace: Protecting Females from Sexual and Violent Offenders in a Community via Smartphones","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047277/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316043","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iMace: Protecting Females from Sexual and Violent Offenders in a Community via Smartphones","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.632103S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6047282,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Ching Hsu","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ching","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37531408000"},{"name":"Show-Shiow Tzeng","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Show-Shiow","lastName":"Tzeng","id":"37448956700"},{"name":"Ching-Wen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Wen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37900692000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047282","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Macrocell networks","Numerical models","Computer architecture","Silicon","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","femtocellular radio","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell network","F-BS","fem to-base stations","mobile core network","fixed broadband access network","M-BS","macrobase station","backhaul costs","UE","user equipment","3GPP standards","RNC","radio network controllers","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femto Access Point","Home NodeB","redirecting","femtocell"]}],"abstract":"The F-BSs (Fem to-Base Stations) are deployed indoors and connect to the mobile core network through fixed broadband access network which is paid by users. The power and serviced cell of an F-BS is much smaller than that of an outdoor M-BS (Macro-Base Station). However, F-BS is a good solution to improve the indoor coverage and to reduce the number of outdoor M-BSs and the therefore cost, including backhaul costs. Therefore, the tariff for connections through FBSs should be cheaper than those through M-BSs. Thus, users would prefer make connections via F-BSs rather than via MBSs. This paper proposes a novel scheme by redirecting an idle UE (User Equipment) to its accessible F-BS, if available, whenever the UE makes a call. This novel scheme is completely compatible to existing 3GPP standards and can be adopted in RNCs (Radio Network Controllers) immediately. Our study shows the proposed scheme does increase the probability of making calls via F-BSs in terms of longer call setup time.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.13","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","startPage":"114","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study for Connection Establishment in Femtocell Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Study for Connection Establishment in Femtocell Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047282/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12308788","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study for Connection Establishment in Femtocell Network","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084901S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6047283,"authors":[{"name":"I-Shyan Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Shyan","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37289088400"},{"name":"Chien-Yao Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Yao","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37896252700"},{"name":"Bor-Jiunn Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, Ming-Chuan University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bor-Jiunn","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37588610900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel adaptive ant colony slot assignment (ACSA) algorithm including construct solution and pheromone update is proposed to assign OFDMA-based radio resource.

In addition, relaying is one of the proposed technique for future releases of UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks which aims to increase the coverage and capability of LTE networks. A LTE network is called as relay enhanced LTE network if the LTE network adopting the relays. A user can handover not only two relays, but also between relays and base stations, and two base stations. It is important to provide a seamlessly handover solution in the relay enhanced LTE network. During mobility, the packet loss problem is occurred if some packets are sent to the previous base station (or relay) when a user equipment (UE) is already handover to the current base station (or relay). To solve this problem, a data forwarding procedure is performed to re-direct these buffered packets from the previous base station (or relay) to the current base station (or relay). In this paper, we develop a new data forwarding protocol with the assistance of femtocells, called as a femtocell-assisted data forwarding, in the relay enhanced LTE networks to provide a seamlessly handover result with the low packet loss rate and the high throughput. Finally, the simulation results illustrate that our proposed protocol outperforms the existing data forwarding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.49","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047284.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Femtocell-Assisted Data Forwarding Protocol in Relay Enhanced LTE Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047284/","displayDocTitle":"A Femtocell-Assisted Data Forwarding Protocol in Relay Enhanced LTE Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12308789","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047284/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Femtocell-Assisted Data Forwarding Protocol in Relay Enhanced LTE Networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080406S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6047285,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37835647100"},{"name":"Guosun Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guosun","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37276697000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047285","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trusted Dynamic Scheduling for Large-Scale Parallel Distributed Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic scheduling","Computational modeling","Peer to peer computing","Processor scheduling","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cloud computing","grid computing","parallel processing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trusted dynamic scheduling","large-scale parallel distributed systems","grid computing","cloud computing","distributed computing paradigm","trust mechanism-based task scheduling model","Bayesian cognitive method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scheduling","trustworthiness","Bayesian model","distributed computing","cloud computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047285","abstract":"The terms parallel distributed systems, and grid and cloud computing, actually refer to slightly different things.

Because cloud computing provides powerful storage capability and scalability, many application providers start migrating the data stored in their original databases to outsourced databases (ODB), such as AMAZONSIMPLEDB. However, because of the multiple tenants and multiple replicas of data in the cloud databases, the security issues of location-based services (LBS)become more serious in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a security model for LBS using ODB and demonstrate how we can use distributed storage and international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) as user identification to secure the location data. Enhanced privacy and authentication mechanisms on top of the suggested security framework are also proposed, which achieve significant improvements in privacy, authentication, and continuity when providing LBS in cloud computing. Simulation results show that network coding scheme has better performance than hash function scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Security Framework of Group Location-Based Mobile Applications in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047291.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Security Framework of Group Location-Based Mobile Applications in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047291/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Security Framework of Group Location-Based Mobile Applications in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055488S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047304,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We study the problem of energy-constrained dynamic allocation of tasks to a heterogeneous cluster computing environment. Our goal is to complete as many tasks by their individual deadlines and within the system energy constraint as possible given that task execution times are uncertain and the system is oversubscribed at times. We use Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to balance the energy consumption and execution time of each task. We design and evaluate (via simulation) a set of heuristics and filtering mechanisms for making allocations in our system. We show that the appropriate choice of filtering mechanisms improves performance more than the choice of heuristics (among the heuristics we tested).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047304/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047304/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12316066","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Constrained Dynamic Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Computing Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Constrained Dynamic Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Computing Environment","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10574S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6047309,"authors":[{"name":"Gihun Jung","affiliation":["Multi Agent and Cloud Computing System laboratory, School of Information and Technology, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gihun","lastName":"Jung","id":"37895416800"},{"name":"Kwang Mong Sim","affiliation":["Multi Agent and Cloud Computing System laboratory, School of Information and Technology, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang Mong","lastName":"Sim","id":"37559596300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047309","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Adaptation models","Monitoring","Data models","Delay","Distributed databases","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","multi-agent systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud service provider","distributed data center","agent based adaptive resource allocation model","consumer job allocation","geographical distance","network delay","cloud computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agent-Based Cloud Computing","Adaptive Resource Allocation","Virtualization"]}],"abstract":"Since both consumers and data centers of a cloud service provider can be distributed in geographically, the provider needs to allocate each consumer request to an appropriate data center among the distributed data centers, so that the consumers can satisfy with the service in terms of fast allocation time and execution response time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation model that allocates the consumer's job to an appropriate data center. The method to adaptively find a proper data center is based on two evaluations: 1) the geographical distance (network delay)between a consumer and data centers, and 2) the workload of each data center. The proposed model is implemented in an agent based test bed. The test bed simulates a cloud computing environment adopting the proposed adaptive resource allocation model. Empirical results were obtained from simulations using the test bed. The results suggest that the proposed model can successfully allocate consumers' requests to the data center closest to each consumer. Also, the proposed model shows a better response time for allocation than related resource allocation models.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.18","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047309.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agent-Based Adaptive Resource Allocation on the Cloud Computing Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047309/","displayDocTitle":"Agent-Based Adaptive Resource Allocation on the Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047309/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316071","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent-Based Adaptive Resource Allocation on the Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074278S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047312,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Lu","affiliation":["Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37656252900"},{"name":"Bing Wang","affiliation":["Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899796100"},{"name":"Li Zha","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zha","id":"37287254700"},{"name":"Zhiwei Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37273450300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1337-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4511-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2016"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6047312","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Bandwidth","Benchmark testing","Prototypes","Servers","Message passing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","message passing","parallel processing","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MapReduce application","message passing interface standard","high-performance computing","data intensive computing","Hadoop codebase","communication identification","prototype library","MPI-D"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPI","MPI-D","Hadoop","MapReduce"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047312","abstract":"The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard and its implementations (such as MPICH and OpenMPI) have been widely used in the high-performance computing area to provide an efficient communication infrastructure. This paper investigates whether MPI can be adapted to the data intensive computing area to substantially speed up Hadoop and MapReduce applications, by reducing communication overheads. Three specific issues are studied. First, is the potential for reducing communication overheads significant, if MPI is used? Second, what are the main technical challenges to adapt MPI to Hadoop? Third, what are the minimal extensions to the MPI standard that can help alleviate the challenges while promise to significantly improve performance? To answer the first question, we identify important and basic communication primitives in both MPI and Hadoop, and make fair comparisons of their performance through experiments. The results show that the potential for improvement could be high. To answer the second and the third questions, we analyze the Hadoop code base to identify communication related programmers' needs. Furthermore, we propose a minimal interface extension to the MPI standard (only one pair of library calls are added), which capture the key-value pair nature commonly found in data intensive computing. This extension is implemented in a prototype library called MPI-D. Benchmark tests based on simulation show that Hadoop augmented with MPI-D could significantly speed up MapReduce application performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047049","publicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046212/6047049/06047312.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2011.56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2011.56","startPage":"371","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can MPI Benefit Hadoop and MapReduce Applications?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047312/","displayDocTitle":"Can MPI Benefit Hadoop and MapReduce Applications?","htmlLink":"/document/6047312/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12316074","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can MPI Benefit Hadoop and MapReduce Applications?","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4511a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061935S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046212","isNumber":"6047049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046212","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6047049","articleId":"6047312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047328,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Masotti","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Masotti","id":"37268749600"},{"name":"Alessandra Costanzo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Costanzo","id":"37275108300"},{"name":"Franco Mastri","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Mastri","id":"37268747500"},{"name":"Martino Aldrigo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Martino","lastName":"Aldrigo","id":"37892005000"},{"name":"Vittorio Rizzoli","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Rizzoli","id":"37275106700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1687-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1685-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1686-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6047328","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Solid modeling","MIMO","Arrays","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","circuit CAD","electromagnetic field theory","MIMO communication","radio links","radiowave propagation","receiving antennas","telecommunication computing","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear-electromagnetic codesign","UWB radio links","MIMO radio links","computer-aided design procedure","circuit-level microwave system simulation","propagation analysis tools","multi-input multi-output system","EM theory","Norton equivalent generators","receiver excitation","transmitting antenna","harmonic frequency","impulse-radio UWB signal","highly-complex radio frequency links","rigorous circuit-level CAD tool","receiving antennas","optimum transmitted pulse shape"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate a general and rigorous computer-aided design (CAD) procedure that can potentially provide a systematic answer to the needs of modern circuit-level microwave system simulation/design by combining nonlinear, electromagnetic (EM), and propagation analysis tools.

The packaging and performance of the antenna in this integrated platform are thus critical factors to consider as an antenna designer. The need for reliable and efficient numerical techniques has been growing as the designs get more complex and a good prediction of system performance becomes essential for cost reduction. There are numerous ways of addressing this issue, such as developing hybrid methods that can avoid the numerical inefficiency of full wave methods while comparable accuracy can be achieved as effectively by asymptotic techniques. Another approach is to implement fast computational methods that utilize parallel computing platforms. It is the latter that is the focus of this paper with a particular focus on the use of general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

Especially, we investigate spatial multiplexing schemes which transmit multiple data streams simultaneously. Due to difficulty in finding an exact expression of the average error rate, we exploit the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) based approach which allows a simple and accurate characterization of the performance. Then, we derive new closed form expressions for bit error rate performance of both the optimal source-relay joint precoding schemes and the optimal relay only precoding schemes in terms of a coding gain as well as a diversity gain. Taking a different pathloss in each hop into consideration, we evaluate the performance in a generalized environment. Through our analysis, we discuss several interesting observations and provide a helpful guideline for designing MMSE-based relaying systems. Monte-Carlo simulations show that our analytical work accurately predicts numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06047537.pdf","startPage":"3452","endPage":"3462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.100421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.100421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of MMSE-Based Amplify and Forward Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Relaying Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","MIMO","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","precoding","probability","relays","source coding","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE-based amplify and forward spatial multiplexing","MIMO relaying system","average error probability","minimum mean squared error","relay network","multiple antenna","spatial multiplexing scheme","Monte-Carlo simulation","diversity gain","coding gain","optimal relay only precoding scheme","optimal source-relay joint precoding scheme","bit error rate performance","closed form expression","SNR","signal-to-noise-ratio","average error rate","transmit multiple data stream"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay systems","MIMO","precoding","MMSE solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of MMSE-Based Amplify and Forward Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Relaying Systems","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6047537/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425631","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of MMSE-Based Amplify and Forward Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"3452-tc1112-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180861S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6047537","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047540,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Scagliola","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6110251/6047540/6047540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Scagliola received the B.S. degree from the Polythecnic of Bari, the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. In information engineering from the Polythecnic of Bari, Bari, Italy, in 2006 and in 2010, respectively.","From 2007 through 2009, he was involved in the Scuola Interpolitecnica di Dottorato, a joint Ph.D. program managed by the Polythecnic of Turin, the Polythecnic of Milan and the Polythecnic of Bari.

The main improvement with respect to conventional hierarchical modulation, which is included with the same purpose in various wireless technologies, is that the low-priority data stream can be decoded from the received subcarrier symbols without any previous equalization for multipath fading channels. As a consequence, the expected performance is nearly invariant of the channel estimation method used to equalize the channel. The low-priority stream is inserted adopting a gain-invariant dirty paper coding based on Rational Dither Modulation, which was proposed for data hiding applications. In this paper an analysis of the developed system is presented and several simulations have been carried out using DVB-T system parameters to verify the validity of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the better performance of the proposed method with respect to that of a conventional hierarchical modulation, particularly when the accuracy of the estimated channel response decreases.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.100544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06047540.pdf","startPage":"3323","endPage":"3334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.100544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain-Invariant Dirty Paper Coding for Hierarchical OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047540/","displayDocTitle":"Gain-Invariant Dirty Paper Coding for Hierarchical OFDM","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425634","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047540/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain-Invariant Dirty Paper Coding for Hierarchical OFDM","sourcePdf":"3323-tc1112-scag.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095981S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6047540","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047541,"authors":[{"name":"David Morales-Jimenez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Campus de Teatinos s/n, M\u00e1laga, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6110251/6047541/6047541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["D.

In particular, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) output statistics of several MIMO systems depends on the diagonal distribution of a complex Wishart matrix. In this paper, we derive the joint density of the diagonal elements of a complex Wishart matrix, which follows a multivariate chi-square distribution. The density expression is in the form of an infinite series representation which converges rapidly and is easy to compute. This expression is used to obtain the distribution of the maximum of the diagonal elements, which allows analyzing the performance of two different MIMO systems under practical conditions. First, our statistical results are applied to the outage probability characterization of MIMO systems with receive antenna selection in spatially correlated Rayleigh fading. Then, the same results are used to analyze the outage probability of transmit beamforming systems under limited-rate feedback.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100611.100641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06047541.pdf","startPage":"3475","endPage":"3484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100611.100641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Diagonal Distribution of a Complex Wishart Matrix and its Application to the Analysis of MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047541/","displayDocTitle":"On the Diagonal Distribution of a Complex Wishart Matrix and its Application to the Analysis of MIMO Systems","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425635","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047541/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Diagonal Distribution of a Complex Wishart Matrix and its Application to the Analysis of MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"3475-tc1112-jimenez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074835S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6047541","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047543,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37399458200"},{"name":"Jiangtao Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Wen","id":"37291696100"},{"name":"Weiyi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiyi","lastName":"Wu","id":"38008842100"},{"name":"Yuxing Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuxing","lastName":"Han","id":"37406874100"},{"name":"Shiqiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiqiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292111600"},{"name":"John Villasenor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Villasenor","id":"37272280100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6047543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":888},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We describe a highly scalable parallel arithmetic coder for Markov inputs suitable for implementation on modern multi-core processors.

This code design approach can be considered as a generalization of the well-known method which uses the point-block incidence matrix of a Steiner 2-design for the code construction. Though the given method can be applied on any Steiner system S(t, k, v), in this paper we focus only on Steiner systems with t \u2265 3. Furthermore, we show that not only a Steiner system (X,B) itself, but also its residual design with respect to an arbitrary point x \u2208 X can be employed for code construction. We also present a technique for constructing binary and non-binary QC-LDPC codes from Steiner systems. The Tanner graph of the constructed codes is free of 4-cycles and hence the codes have girth at least six. Simulation results show that the so constructed codes perform well over the AWGN channel with iterative message-passing decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.110120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6149856/06047544.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.101011.110120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Construction of Structured Binary Regular LDPC Codes Based on Steiner Systems with Parameter t>2","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","displayDocTitle":"A New Construction of Structured Binary Regular LDPC Codes Based on Steiner Systems with Parameter t>2","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047544/","publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12527259","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047544/","volume":"60","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Construction of Structured Binary Regular LDPC Codes Based on Steiner Systems with Parameter t>2","sourcePdf":"074-tc1201-falsa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091705S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6149856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6149856","articleId":"6047544","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6047546,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Sabbaghian","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Sabbaghian","id":"37294633700"},{"name":"Yongjun Kwak","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37954731000"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","id":"37271249900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6047546","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1155},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Decoding","Block codes","Frequency domain analysis","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","block codes","decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual BCH codes","low PAPR OFDM","dual Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri codes","coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","maximum a posteriori decoding algorithm","time-frequency turbo structure","Shannon limit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","multicarrier","dual BCH code","turbo block code","PAPR"]}],"abstract":"Dual Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri (BCH) codes, despite their favorable peak to average power ratio (PAPR) properties, have not been used in coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

To date, FFR techniques have been typically been evaluated through system-level simulations using a hexagonal grid for the base station locations. This paper instead focuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of FFR deployments - Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) - using a Poisson point process to model the base station locations. The results are compared with the standard grid model and an actual urban deployment. Under reasonable special cases for modern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions, which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits of Strict FFR, SFR, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse. Finally, a SINR-proportional resource allocation strategy is proposed based on the analytical expressions and we observe that FFR provides an increase in the sum-rate as well as the well-known benefit of improved coverage for cell-edge users.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.110181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06047548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.110181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","startPage":"4294","endPage":"4305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Fractional Frequency Reuse for OFDMA Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Fractional Frequency Reuse for OFDMA Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425537","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047548/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Evaluation of Fractional Frequency Reuse for OFDMA Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"4294-tw1112-novlan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09815S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6047548","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6047549,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

In this paper, we derive a maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder for the DF protocol utilizing arbitrary complex-valued constellations including M-PSK, M-PAM, and M-QAM. A set-up of a single pair of source and destination with one relay is studied. The source and the relay utilize orthogonal uncoded transmissions. The relay performs ML decoding and forwards the decoded symbol to the destination, and it might commit errors in decoding the data. The ML decoder at the destination is obtained by maximizing the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the data received during two orthogonal transmissions at the destination under the assumption that the average probability of error of the source-relay link is known at the destination. The proposed ML decoder is a generalized decoder which is applicable to arbitrary constellations, whereas, one existing DF cooperative decoder is applicable to the real valued constellations like BPSK and M-PAM. One existing decoder is also applicable to M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-QAM constellations. We also derive a low-complexity piecewise linear (PL) decoder for arbitrary complex-valued M-point constellations which performs similar to the ML decoder for all signal-to-noise ratio values. An approximate expression of the symbol error rate (SER) of the PL decoder for M-PSK constellation is derived. By using the approximate SER expressions, it is proved that the proposed ML and PL decoders achieve full diversity of two in the cooperative system studied.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.101341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06047549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.101341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","startPage":"4080","endPage":"4090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML Decoder for Decode-and-Forward Based Cooperative Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ML Decoder for Decode-and-Forward Based Cooperative Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425538","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6047549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML Decoder for Decode-and-Forward Based Cooperative Communication System","sourcePdf":"4080-tw1112-bhat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067853S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6047549","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6047551,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Elkourdi","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6047551/6047551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tariq Elkourdi received the B.

However, the interference created by femtocell transmissions may critically impair the performance of the macrocell users. In this paper, a novel approach to the operation of HBSs is proposed, whereby the HBSs act as relays with the aim of improving transmission reliability for femtocell users and, possibly, also macrocell users. The proposed approach enables cooperative strategies between HBS and macrocell base stations (BSs), and is unlike the conventional deployment of femtocells where HBSs operate as isolated encoders and decoders. The performance advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated by studying the transmission reliability of macro and femto users for a quasi-static fading channel in terms of outage probability and diversity-multiplexing trade-off for uplink and, more briefly, for downlink. Overall, the analytical and numerical results lend evidence to the fact that operating femtocells as relays may potentially offset the performance losses associated with the presence of additional active users in the cell due to femtocells and even provide overall performance gains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell as a Relay: An Outage Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.102046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06047551.pdf","startPage":"4204","endPage":"4213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.100611.102046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell as a Relay: An Outage Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6047551/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425540","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell as a Relay: An Outage Analysis","sourcePdf":"4204-tw1112-elkourdi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100823S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6047551","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6047552,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292503700"},{"name":"Chiuan-Hsu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiuan-Hsu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539310400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6047552","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Noise measurement","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Upper bound","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","interference suppression","multipath channels","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial cancellation factors","two-stage hard-decision PPIC scheme","DS-CDMA systems","partial parallel interference cancellation","direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Price theorem","multipath fading environments","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","partial cancellation factors (PCFs)","partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC)","Price's theorem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a simple method of selecting the partial cancellation factors (PCFs) for a two-stage, hard-decision, partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC) detector for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems.

Moreover, a multistage PPIC detector using the proposed PCFs in the first two stages achieves its BER performance limit with fewer stages.

In the proposed scenario, task allocation consists in assigning the robots to the found targets in a 2-D arena. The expected distribution is obtained from the targets' qualities that are represented as scalar values. Decision-making mechanism is distributed and robots autonomously choose their assignments taking into account targets' qualities and distances. We tested the scalability of the proposed DBA algorithm in terms of number of robots and number of targets. For that, the experiments were performed in the simulator for various sets of parameters, including number of robots, number of targets, and targets' utilities. Control parameters inherent to DBA were tuned to test how they affect the final robot distribution. The simulation results show that by increasing the robot swarm size, the distribution error decreased.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2011.2167820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/6203631/06047561.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2167820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6203631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Bees Algorithm for Task Allocation in Swarm of Robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047561/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Bees Algorithm for Task Allocation in Swarm of Robots","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12850654","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047561/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Bees Algorithm for Task Allocation in Swarm of Robots","sourcePdf":"jsyst-jevtic-2167820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068981S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6203631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6203631","articleId":"6047561","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6047564,"authors":[{"name":"Gerwin Schalk","affiliation":["Division of Translational Medicine, Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4664312/6121958/6047564/6047564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerwin Schalk received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Graz University of Technology, in 1999, and the M.S. degree in IT and the Ph.D. degree in CSE both from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He is a Research Scientist at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health.

BCI systems measure specific features of brain activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output. The sensor modalities that have most commonly been used in BCI studies have been electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from the scalp and single- neuron recordings from within the cortex. Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies has explored the use of electro-corticographic (ECoG) activity recorded directly from the surface of the brain. ECoG has attracted substantial and increasing interest, because it has been shown to reflect specific details of actual and imagined actions, and because its technical characteristics should readily support robust and chronic implementations of BCI systems in humans. This review provides general perspectives on the ECoG platform; describes the different electrophysiological features that can be detected in ECoG; elaborates on the signal acquisition issues, protocols, and online performance of ECoG- based BCI studies to date; presents important limitations of current ECoG studies; discusses opportunities for further research; and finally presents a vision for eventual clinical implementation. In summary, the studies presented to date strongly encourage further research using the ECoG platform for basic neuroscientific research, as well as for translational neuroprosthetic applications.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2011.2172408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/6121958/06047564.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2011.2172408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Using Electrocorticographic Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","displayDocTitle":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Using Electrocorticographic Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047564/","publicationDate":"2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12470271","pubMedId":"22273796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047564/","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Using Electrocorticographic Signals","sourcePdf":"rbme-schalk-2172408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.298228S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"6121958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"6121958","articleId":"6047564","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6047565,"authors":[{"name":"Navin Chatlani","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6145765/6047565/6047565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Navin Chatlani received the B.Sc.

This method is particularly effective in low-frequency noise environments. Unlike previous EMD-based denoising methods, this approach does not make the assumption that the contaminating noise signal is fractional Gaussian noise. An adaptive method is developed to select the IMF index for separating the noise components from the speech based on the second-order IMF statistics. The low-frequency noise components are then separated by a partial reconstruction from the IMFs. It is shown that the proposed EMDF technique is able to suppress residual noise from speech signals that were enhanced by the conventional optimally modified log-spectral amplitude approach which uses a minimum statistics-based noise estimate. A comparative performance study is included that demonstrates the effectiveness of the EMDF system in various noise environments, such as car interior noise, military vehicle noise, and babble noise. In particular, improvements up to 10 dB are obtained in car noise environments. Listening tests were performed that confirm the results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2172428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06047565.pdf","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1166","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2172428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMD-Based Filtering (EMDF) of Low-Frequency Noise for Speech Enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"EMD-Based Filtering (EMDF) of Low-Frequency Noise for Speech Enhancement","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6047565/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12524350","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMD-Based Filtering (EMDF) of Low-Frequency Noise for Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"tasl-chatlani-2172428-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055116S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6047565","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6047566,"authors":[{"name":"Virginia Estellers","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Laboratory LTS5, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6145765/6047566/6047566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Virginia Estellers (M'10) was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1984.

In these circumstances it is necessary to introduce audio and visual weights to control the contribution of each modality to the recognition task. We present a method to set the value of the weights associated to each stream according to their reliability for speech recognition, allowing them to change with time and adapt to different noise and working conditions. Our dynamic weights are derived from several measures of the stream reliability, some specific to speech processing and others inherent to any classification task, and take into account the special role of silence detection in the definition of audio and visual weights. In this paper, we propose a new confidence measure, compare it to existing ones, and point out the importance of the correct detection of silence utterances in the definition of the weighting system. Experimental results support our main contribution: the inclusion of a voice activity detector in the weighting scheme improves speech recognition over different system architectures and confidence measures, leading to an increase in performance more relevant than any difference between the proposed confidence measures.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2172427","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06047566.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2172427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Dynamic Stream Weighting for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Speech recognition","Visualization","Weight measurement","Reliability","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","audio streaming","audio-visual systems","signal classification","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic stream weighting scheme","audio-visual speech recognition","audio information","visual information","speech processing","classification task","silence detection","silence utterance","voice activity detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive weighting","audio-visual speech recognition","multi-modal classification","multi-stream hidden Markov model (HMM)","robust speech recognition","stream reliability","voice activity detection (VAD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"On Dynamic Stream Weighting for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6047566/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12524347","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Dynamic Stream Weighting for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-estellers-2172427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093151S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6047566","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6047568,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Ozerov","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6145765/6047568/6047568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexey Ozerov (M'11) received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Saint-Petersburg State University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France, in 2006.","During the Ph.D. degree from 2003 to 2006, he was with the labs of France Telecom R&D and in collaboration with the IRISA institute.

We first introduce the framework by describing the model structure and constraints, explaining its generality, and summarizing its algorithmic implementation using a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm.

There is a problem with the original phase information extraction method when comparing two phase values. For example, the difference in the two values of \u03c0-\\mathtilde\u03b8\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and \\mathtilde\u03b8\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n=-\u03c0+\\mathtilde\u03b8\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n is 2\u03c0-2\\mathtilde\u03b8\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n .

To address this problem, we map the phase into coordinates on a unit circle. Speaker identification and verification experiments are performed using the NTT database which consists of sentences uttered by 35 (22 male and 13 female) Japanese speakers with normal, fast and slow speaking modes during five sessions. Although the phase information-based method performs worse than the MFCC-based method, it augments the MFCC and the combination is useful for speaker recognition. The proposed modified phase information is more robust than the original phase information for all speaking modes. By integrating the modified phase information with the MFCCs, the speaker identification rate was improved to 98.8% from 97.4% (MFCC), and equal error rate for speaker verification was reduced to 0.45% from 0.72% (MFCC), respectively. We also conducted the speaker identification and verification experiments on a large-scale Japanese Newspaper Article Sentences (JNAS) database, a similar trend as NTT database was obtained.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06047571.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2172422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2172422","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker Identification and Verification by Combining MFCC and Phase Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047571/","displayDocTitle":"Speaker Identification and Verification by Combining MFCC and Phase Information","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047571/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12524346","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker Identification and Verification by Combining MFCC and Phase Information","sourcePdf":"tasl-wang-2172422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109176S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6047571","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047576,"authors":[{"name":"Axel Krieger","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/6047576/6047576-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Axel Krieger (M\u201905) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2008.","He is currently a Product Leader at Prostate Solutions, Sentinelle Medical, Toronto, ON, Canada, a Hologic Division.

The robot performs actuated needle MRI guidance with the goals of providing 1) MRI compatibility; 2) MRI-guided needle placement with accuracy sufficient for targeting clinically significant prostate cancer foci; 3) reducing interventional procedure times (thus increasing patient comfort and reducing opportunity for needle targeting error due to patient motion); 4) enabling real-time MRI monitoring of interventional procedures; and 5) reducing the opportunities for error that arise in manually actuated needle placement. The design of the robot, employing piezoceramic-motor actuated needle guide positioning and manual needle insertion, is reported. Results of an MRI compatibility study show no reduction of MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the disabled motors. Enabling the motors reduces the SNR by 80% without radio frequency (RF) shielding, but the SNR is only reduced by 40-60% with RF shielding. The addition of RF shielding is shown to significantly reduce image SNR degradation caused by the presence of the robotic device. An accuracy study of MRI-guided biopsy needle placements in a prostate phantom is reported. The study shows an average in-plane targeting error of 2.4 mm with a maximum error of 3.7 mm. These data indicate that the system's needle targeting accuracy is similar to that obtained with a previously reported manually actuated system, and is sufficient to reliably sample clinically significant prostate cancer foci under MRI guidance.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2163523","startPage":"273","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/06047576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2163523","endPage":"284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Evaluation of an Actuated MRI-Compatible Robotic System for MRI-Guided Prostate Intervention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Development and Evaluation of an Actuated MRI-Compatible Robotic System for MRI-Guided Prostate Intervention","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6047576/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12982066","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","pubMedId":"23326181","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Evaluation of an Actuated MRI-Compatible Robotic System for MRI-Guided Prostate Intervention","sourcePdf":"tmech-whitcomb-2163523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122593S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"6047576","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6047577,"authors":[{"name":"Renfei Liu","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6069922/6047577/6047577-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renfei Liu (M'09) received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently with Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA.

The supply voltage is deliberately overscaled for saving power, which introduces errors due to timing violation. These VOS-incurred errors are then compensated by using an estimation-based noise reduction scheme, at the cost of minimal performance degradation while achieving significant power savings. In this paper, novel noise reduction unit (NRU) architectures are proposed to solve two challenging problems. First, we propose to use a separate reliable mechanism for detecting VOS-incurred errors, which frees the estimator from detecting VOS-incurred errors, and consequently enables use of folding techniques and filter adaptation. Second, we propose a novel noise reduction architecture for compensating errors in broadband frequency-selective filters, which show loose statistical dependency that leads to poor estimation in conventional designs. In addition, we recognize that the location of VOS-errors is the most destructive cause to NRU performance degradation, which has not been adequately dealt with in existing literatures. Our proposed architectures are based on smoothing filters, which require minimal hardware overhead while limiting the estimation degradation due to relative dense error distribution. Compared to previous work, the simulation results show that for narrow-band filters our proposed schemes can improve the noise reduction performance by 10-22 dB while achieving the same or better power savings, and for broadband filters the proposed schemes achieve 9-21 dB performance gain while achieving 10.33%-51.74% power savings.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6069922/06047577.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Reduction in Frequency-Selective FIR Filters Under Voltage Overscaling","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2165749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2165749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Power Reduction in Frequency-Selective FIR Filters Under Voltage Overscaling","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331863","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6047577/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Reduction in Frequency-Selective FIR Filters Under Voltage Overscaling","sourcePdf":"jetcas-liu-2165749-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091077S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"6047577","onlineDate":"17 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6047578,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bousquet","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6155677/6047578/6047578-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Francois Bousquet received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2000 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently working as a high-speed analog IC designer at Ciena in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Real-time forecasting of network traffic load accurately and in a computationally efficient manner is the key element of proactive network management and congestion control. This paper compares predictions produced by different types of neural networks (NN) with forecasts from statistical time series models (ARMA, ARAR, HW). The novelty of our approach is to predict aggregated Ethernet traffic with NNs employing multiresolution learning (MRL) which is based on wavelet decomposition. In addition, we introduce a new NN training paradigm, namely the combination of multi-task learning with MRL. The experimental results show that nonlinear prediction based on NNs is better suited for traffic prediction purposes than linear forecasting models. Moreover, MRL helps to exploit the correlation structures at lower resolutions of the traffic trace and improves the generalization capability of NNs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047849","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047826","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041100/6047826/06047849.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of network traffic prediction based on neural networks with multi-task learning and multiresolution decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6047849/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of network traffic prediction based on neural networks with multi-task learning and multiresolution decomposition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6047849/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12317257","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of network traffic prediction based on neural networks with multi-task learning and multiresolution decomposition","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP11095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088638S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6041100","isNumber":"6047826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6041100","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6047826","articleId":"6047849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6047856,"authors":[{"name":"Bernadette Varga","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Bernadette","lastName":"Varga","id":"37892970200"},{"name":"Adrian Groza","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Groza","id":"37540343300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1481-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1479-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6047856","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Data mining","Internet","Ontologies","Encyclopedias","Recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","natural language processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","recommender systems","social networking (online)","travel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SentiWordNet","tourism recommender system","social Web","Web 2.0","recommendation techniques","DBpedia ontology","natural language processing","formal justification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047856","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6041100/6047826/06047856.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6047856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating DBpedia and SentiWordNet for a tourism recommender system","abstract":"The popularity of the social web introduces opportunities for the recommender systems, whilst new challenges arise when semantic knowledge is integrated in the landscape.

The paper demonstrates the methodology and shows its applicability by synthesizing the designs and comparing the results that show improved performance as compared to traditional designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithmic transformation for FPGA implementation of high throughput filters","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2011.6048450","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2011.6048450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048441","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036257/6048441/06048450.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6048450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6048450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An algorithmic transformation for FPGA implementation of high throughput filters","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6048450/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317092","conferenceDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithmic transformation for FPGA implementation of high throughput filters","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"AnAlgorithmicTransformationforFPGAImplementat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054969S","chronDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036257","isNumber":"6048441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036257","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6048441","articleId":"6048450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6048463,"authors":[{"name":"Rehanullah Khan","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Aided Automation, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Rehanullah","lastName":"Khan","id":"37586143300"},{"name":"Robert Sablatnig","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Aided Automation, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Sablatnig","id":"37270943200"},{"name":"Abdul Bais","affiliation":["Sarhad University of Science and Information Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Bais","id":"37586474500"},{"name":"Yahya M.

Secondly, which SR technique will produce SR image that is more appealing to human eyes? For resultant SR image, EBSR predicts the relation between high and low frequencies in an image, whereas RBSR algorithms rely on a sequence of frames. From the experimental results on test images, we find that compared to RBSR, EBSR preserves the structure of the original image. Knowing this capability is important for detection and recognition systems. In terms of visual appearance, RBSR is preferred except when there are large motions in consecutive frames. Moreover, the aliasing artifacts cannot be removed by EBSR algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Indexes","Training","Spatial resolution","Image reconstruction","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image recognition","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based super-resolution","EBSR","reconstruction-based super-resolution","RBSR","SR image","structure similarity","image frame sequence","recognition system","detection system","visual appearance","aliasing artifacts"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICET.2011.6048463","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036257/6048441/06048463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2011.6048463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of reconstruction and example-based Super-Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6048463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of reconstruction and example-based Super-Resolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6048463/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6048463/","accessionNumber":"12317100","conferenceDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of reconstruction and example-based Super-Resolution","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ComparisonofReconstructionandExampleBasedSupe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069782S","chronDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036257","isNumber":"6048441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036257","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048441","articleId":"6048463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6048476,"authors":[{"name":"Nabeel Ali Khan","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Federal Urdu University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Nabeel Ali","lastName":"Khan","id":"37399686000"},{"name":"M Noman Jafri","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Federal Urdu University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"M Noman","lastName":"Jafri","id":"37901081200"},{"name":"Saad A Qazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NED University, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saad A","lastName":"Qazi","id":"38558378100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0768-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0769-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0767-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6048476","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms","Signal resolution","Spectrogram","Frequency modulation","Chirp","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal representation","signal resolution","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time frequency representation","frequency resolution","time resolution","short time Fourier transform resolution"]}],"abstract":"Short time Fourier transform is simple and yet effective tool for computing time frequency representations.

However, when applied indiscriminately, thread squashing and re-execution can incur significant overhead and TLS may result in performance degradation compared to sequential code. A thorough analysis of code for potentially available parallelism is crucial for choosing between speculative or non-speculative execution. In this paper, we present the outcome of an empirical study on a collection of sequential applications to determine what type of parallelism is available and whether it is beneficial to use TLS. We developed a tool, named SeekBin, which observes Java classes at load time for opportunities of parallelism in the bytecode. SeekBin uses profiler feedback and emits data about actually called methods only, which can be used to determine suitability of applying TLS.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2011.6048489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2011.6048489","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036257/6048441/06048489.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SeekBin: An automated tool for analyzing thread level speculative parallelization potential","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6048489/","conferenceDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SeekBin: An automated tool for analyzing thread level speculative parallelization potential","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317124","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6048489/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SeekBin: An automated tool for analyzing thread level speculative parallelization potential","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"SeekBinAnAutomatedToolforAnalyzingThreadLevel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165434S","chronDate":"5-6 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036257","isNumber":"6048441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036257","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048441","articleId":"6048489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6048491,"authors":[{"name":"Samiur Rehman","affiliation":["Analog Mixed Signal Group (AMSG) at Electrical Engineering Department, NUST, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Samiur","lastName":"Rehman","id":"37085579092"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Khalid","affiliation":["Analog Mixed Signal Group (AMSG) at Electrical Engineering Department, NUST, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37069218800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0768-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0769-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0767-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6048491","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Switches","Frequency modulation","Transmitters","Linearity","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","filters","mathematics computing","power amplifiers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched mode transmitter architecture","low pass continuous time delta sigma modulator","MATLAB simulations","loop filter design","class-D amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["delta sigma","integrator","switched mode","power efficient","linear"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6048491","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2011.6048491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2011.6048491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048441","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036257/6048441/06048491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched mode transmitter architecture using low pass delta sigma modulator","abstract":"Several design challenges of a low pass continuous time delta sigma modulator (LP DSM), to be used in switched mode transmitter architecture, have been identified.

This paper proposes a ground-based radar system using a MIMO phased array antenna layout to accurately monitor thickness changes and provide 2 dimensional cross-range information of the ice shelf. The radar system used to collect data is a Step Frequency (SFCW) Radar using multiple transmitting and receiving antennas which operate orthogonally in time. The MIMO antenna layout is shown together with the beam pattern from the associated virtual array. The aperture synthesis of the MIMO array using digital beamforming technique is discussed. Results of the aperture synthesis, showing the cross-range and depth profile of the ice shelf to be observed will be shown. The study conducted using the MIMO antennas is part of a future plan to replace the SFCW Radar system with an FMCW system that will allow long term deployments to observe variability in the rate of change of the ice shelf thickness. One of the conclusions of the paper is that a linear version of the MIMO array will make more efficient use of the antennas than a 2D version of the array.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6048923","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06048923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6048923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","startPage":"186","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antarctic ice shelf 3D cross sectional profile imaging using MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6048923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antarctic ice shelf 3D cross sectional profile imaging using MIMO radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6048923/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357335","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6048923/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antarctic ice shelf 3D cross sectional profile imaging using MIMO radar","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086226S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6048923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049018,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Ma\u00f1a","affiliation":["E.T.S.I.Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Ma\u00f1a","id":"37317990800"},{"name":"Antonio Mu\u00f1oz","affiliation":["E.T.S.I.Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Mu\u00f1oz","id":"37305758700"},{"name":"Javier Gonz\u00e1lez","affiliation":["E.T.S.I.Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez","id":"37346456200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1186-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1184-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6049018","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Software","Runtime","Computer architecture","Surveillance","Graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","software architecture","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic security monitoring","virtualized environments","cloud computing","policy-defined conditions","threat detection","anomalous behaviour","secure software execution methods","event-sequence language","automatic policy runtime enforcement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monitoring rules","Accounting","Dynamic Monitoring","Security","Monitoring"]}],"abstract":"An architecture for dynamic security monitoring and enforcement for client software running in Virtualized Environments for Cloud computing is presented.

Such automatic policy runtime enforcement is crucial to achieve proper security in virtualized platforms for cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/IWSSCloud.2011.6049018","publicationTitle":"2011 1st International Workshop on Securing Services on the Cloud (IWSSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 1st International Workshop on Securing Services on the Cloud (IWSSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044611/6049009/06049018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSSCloud.2011.6049018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6049009","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic security monitoring for Virtualized Environments in Cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic security monitoring for Virtualized Environments in Cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049018/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12316434","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6049018/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic security monitoring for Virtualized Environments in Cloud computing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"IWSSC2011Paper01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055422S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044611","isNumber":"6049009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044611","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6049009","articleId":"6049018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6049046,"authors":[{"name":"Gheorghe \u015eerban","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Gheorghe","lastName":"\u015eerban","id":"37398289300"},{"name":"Constantin Anton","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Anton","id":"37409839000"},{"name":"Lauren\u0163iu Ionescu","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Lauren\u0163iu","lastName":"Ionescu","id":"37398291000"},{"name":"Ion Tut\u0103nescu","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Tut\u0103nescu","id":"38228668200"},{"name":"Alin Maz\u0103re","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Maz\u0103re","id":"38228668500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-80-7043-930-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0315-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1803-7232"}],"articleNumber":"6049046","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"abstract":"Forward error correction (FEC) and automatic request (ARQ) are common techniques used to treat transmission errors when data are transmitted over noisy channels. In practical applications where feedback is possible, ARQ technique are often more preferable than FEC schemes because error detection requires much simpler decoding equipment and achieves a higher reliability than does error correction. When the channel is very noisy, the system throughput is smaller for ARQ techniques than FEC schemes because retransmission will be requested too frequently. Hybrid Selective Repeat automatic request schemes (H SR-ARQ), which combine the concepts of FEC and ARQ can provide a high system throughput and maintain high system reliability for communications over quite noisy channel. To increase the speed of communication, we implement an H SR-ARQ hardware system. We choose Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) circuit for hardware implementation because it is flexible, easy to program and low cost and obtain good performances in communication.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Forward error correction","Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Polynomials","Generators","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","decoding","error detection","field programmable gate arrays","forward error correction","noise","reliability","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["64-bit hybrid SR-ARQ algorithm implementation","FPGA","forward error correction","transmission errors","noisy channel","error detection","retransmission request","hybrid selective repeat automatic request scheme","reliability","hybrid SR-ARQ hardware system","field programmable gate array circuit","decoding","storage capacity 64 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049046","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Applied Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036398/6048828/06049046.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048828","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Applied Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a 64-bit hybrid SR-ARQ algorithm on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a 64-bit hybrid SR-ARQ algorithm on FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049046/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049046/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317138","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a 64-bit hybrid SR-ARQ algorithm on FPGA","confLoc":"Pilsen, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"009003pid1987421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045596S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036398","isNumber":"6048828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048828","articleId":"6049046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of West Bohemi","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6049062,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Vasile Iana","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computers, University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Arges, Romania"],"firstName":"Gabriel Vasile","lastName":"Iana","id":"37543175700"},{"name":"Petre Anghelescu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computers, University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Arges, Romania"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Anghelescu","id":"37543175300"},{"name":"Gheorghe Serban","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computers, University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Arges, Romania"],"firstName":"Gheorghe","lastName":"Serban","id":"37398289300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-80-7043-930-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0315-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1803-7232"}],"articleNumber":"6049062","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":819},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Encryption","Hardware","Automata","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","prototypes","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSA encryption algorithm implementation","FPGA area optimization","Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm","prototype programmable structure Xilinx Spartan3","application specific integrated circuits","ASIC structure","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"In this paper is presented an efficient implementation of the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) algorithm as a prototype programmable structure Xilinx Spartan3 to be integrated on an Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) structure.

A 65 nm CMOS Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology has been selected as target; due to its high-resistivity substrate the losses are drastically reduced if compared with the bulk silicon technology and more energy will be provided to the on-chip antenna to radiate. Two different LNA architectures are proposed. First, a three-stage LNA with conventional 50 Ohm input matching allows for a power gain of 23 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 4.04 dB and a power consumption of 35 mW. By relaxing the impedance matching specification, due to on-chip co-design of amplifier and antenna, a new LNA with only two amplification stages has been designed. The two-stage LNA achieves similar performance of the three-stage one (gain >;22 dB, NF<; 5 dB) with a power consumption reduced by 25%. A dipole antenna with coplanar strip feed has been also designed matching the input LNA impedance and allowing an antenna gain of 3.22 dB at 60 GHz with a limited on-chip area occupation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","CMOS integrated circuits","Dipole antennas","CMOS technology","Noise figure","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave antennas","nanoelectronics","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-chip integrated antenna","low noise amplifier","CMOS SOI technology","short-range wireless Gbits applications","short-range wireless transceivers","CMOS silicon-on-insulator technology","high-resistivity substrate","bulk silicon technology","LNA architectures","noise figure","power consumption","amplifier-antenna on-chip codesign","on-chip area occupation","frequency 60 GHz","size 65 nm","noise figure 4.04 dB to 23 dB","power 35 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60-GHz","CMOS Silicon On Insulator (SOI)","LNA (low-noise amplifier)","Integrated antenna","Wireless Gbits/s"]}],"publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Applied Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Applied Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036398/6048828/06049103.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60-GHz single-chip integrated antenna and Low Noise Amplifier in 65-nm CMOS SOI technology for short-range wireless Gbits/s applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"60-GHz single-chip integrated antenna and Low Noise Amplifier in 65-nm CMOS SOI technology for short-range wireless Gbits/s applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049103/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049103/","accessionNumber":"12317184","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60-GHz single-chip integrated antenna and Low Noise Amplifier in 65-nm CMOS SOI technology for short-range wireless Gbits/s applications","confLoc":"Pilsen, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"081003pid1892211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071634S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036398","isNumber":"6048828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048828","articleId":"6049103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of West Bohemi","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6049109,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Liang Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Liang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37406116300"},{"name":"Yao-Ching Hsieh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Natl.

The proposed circuit consists of a buck-boost converter, an L-C resonant network and a step-up transformer. Only one active switch with simple control for turning on and off the switch at a high frequency is used. The inductance of the transformer serves as the inductor of the L-C resonant. In the L-C resonant network, the inductor stores and then releases energy to the capacitor across which the voltage is build up step by step until a relatively high voltage is achieved. This voltage is then stepped up by a transformer to provide the required high voltage for discharging the CCFLs. The proposed circuit has the advantage of simple configuration, small volume and low cost. Besides, a high power factor at the ac line source can be obtained by operating the buck-boost converter at discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The proposed circuit is analyzed and the design equations are derived to determine the circuit parameters. A prototype circuit was built for testing 19 inch CCFLs. The discharging tests are made to recognize the malfunctions during the manufacturing process.

From the experimental results, the FPGA circuit can produce several calibration points of desired range or azimuth direction. In InSAR application, the echo points of ARC system can estimate squint angle difference in two co-registration images. Compared to analog time delay ARC system, the current ARC generates delay error less than 10ns, greatly reduced from 30-50 ns that analog time delay has. In addition, the stability of the time delay and output power in the FPGA based ARC are both much better than the traditional analog delay ARC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049157.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"435","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high precision FPGA-based active radar calibrator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Calibration","Spaceborne radar","Accuracy","Radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","Doppler shift","field programmable gate arrays","geophysical equipment","geophysical image processing","image registration","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable echo points","control points","geometric calibration","radiometric calibration","echo delay","Doppler shift","C-band ERS-2 SAR image","FPGA circuit","calibration points","azimuth direction","InSAR application","squint angle difference","coregistration images","analog time delay ARC system","delay error","output power","high precision FPGA-based active radar calibrator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Radar Calibrator","ARC","Geometric Calibration","Radiometric Calibrations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A high precision FPGA-based active radar calibrator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357399","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high precision FPGA-based active radar calibrator","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060689S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049210,"authors":[{"name":"Nana Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, 100191, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Nana","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jingwen Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, 100191, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049210","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"abstract":"Block-based processing has shown promise to reduce computation complexity and storage space for image Compressed Sensing.

The proposed scheme adopts the basic structure of existing Block Compressed Sensing, and studies the character of SAR images. Based on the difference of statistical property among sub blocks, the proposed scheme can adaptively select the number of measurements that needed to take for every sub blocks. Different from equality measurement, adaptive sampling can sufficiently capture the diversity between sub blocks and keep their properties well. Several numeral experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing scheme, achieving comparable reconstruction quality via fewer measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049210.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"643","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block adaptive compressed sensing of SAR images based on statistical character","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Transforms","Image coding","Sparse matrices","PSNR","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","image sampling","image sensors","statistical analysis","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block adaptive compressed sensing","SAR images","statistical properties","block-based processing","computational complexity","storage space","image compressed sensing","natural images","adaptive sampling","reconstruction quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","SAR image","image processing","statistical character","sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Block adaptive compressed sensing of SAR images based on statistical character","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357449","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block adaptive compressed sensing of SAR images based on statistical character","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045908S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6049215,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085505281"},{"name":"Chunsheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37291258900"},{"name":"Yu Ze","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Ze","id":"37086900393"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049215","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Synthetic aperture radar","Signal to noise ratio","Indexes","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse compression","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise effect","sampling rate","signal sparsity","compressed sensing synthetic aperture radar pulse compression","SAR imaging","Donoho-Tanner phase transition diagram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR","Compressive Sensing","Evaluation"]}],"abstract":"The traditional radar system needs large bandwidth, and the increasing number of channels brings huge amount of data.

Accurate tracking of the expansion or retraction of invasive plant species is especially critical for natural resource managers who must make decisions on the deployment of effective control measures. Many available remote sensing strategies to quantify the location of invasive plant species are either too expensive to deploy on a regular basis or lack sufficient geographic or temporal resolution to be of use to resources managers. This paper presents the results of the use of a new unmanned aerial vehicle platform, called Aggie Air\u2122, and a new classification algorithm to track the spread of an invasive grass species, Phragmites australis, in a large and important wet-land in northern Utah. The combination of high resolution multi-spectral images (in space and time) and the classification algorithm based on advances in statistical learning theory produce quantitative land cover descriptions that identify Phragmites locations with an accuracy of 95 percent. The combination of these two tools provides wetlands managers with new and potentially valuable methods to quantify the spread of Phragmites and to evaluate the efficacy of their attempts to control it.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049252","startPage":"803","endPage":"806","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing

In SAR tomography, the vertical reflectivity function for every azimuth-range pixel is usually recovered by processing data collected using a defined repeat pass acquisition geometry. The most common approach is to generate a synthetic aperture in the elevation direction through imaging from a large number of parallel tracks. This imaging technique is appealing, since it is very simple. However, it has the draw back that large temporal baselines, which is the case for space-borne platforms, can severely affect the reconstruction. In an attempt to reduce the number of parallel tracks, we propose a new tomographic focusing approach that trades number of SAR images for correlations between neighboring azimuth-range pixels and polarimetric channels. As a matter of fact, this can be done under the framework of Distributed Compressed Sensing (DCS), which stems from Compressed Sensing (CS) theory, thus also exploiting sparsity in our tomographic signal. In addition, we address the problem of measurements affected by additive as well as multiplicative speckle noise. Results demonstrating the potential of the DCS methodology will be validated by using fully polarimetric L-band data acquired by the E-SAR sensor of DLR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-signal

interferometric L-band radar instrument that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic Earth processes using advanced techniques and technologies. The mission is science driven aiming to provide a unique data set for climate and environmental research, geodynamics, hydrology and oceanography. Important application examples are global forest height and biomass inventories, measurements of Earth deformation due to tectonic processes and/or anthropogenic factors, observations of ice/glacier velocity field and 3-D structure changes, and the monitoring of soil moisture and ocean surface currents. The Tandem-L mission concept consists of two cooperating satellites flying in close formation. The Pol-InSAR and repeat-pass acquisition modes provide a unique data source to observe, analyse and quantify a wide range of mutually interacting processes in the bio-, litho-, hydroand cryosphere. The systematic observation of these processes benefits from the high data acquisition capacity and the novel high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging modes that combine digital beamforming with a large reflector antenna. This paper provides an overview of the Tandem-L mission concept and its main application areas. It is planned to realise the Tandem-L mission in cooperation with NASA/JPL. The mission concept was developed in detail in a joint two-year pre-phase A study and it will be further studied in the next 18 months. This will allow a cost-effective implementation, whereby each partner contributes its predevelopments and experience. According to current planning, the Tandem-L satellites could be launched in 2019.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049324","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049324.pdf","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tandem-L: A mission proposal for monitoring dynamic earth processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049324/","displayDocTitle":"Tandem-L: A mission proposal for monitoring dynamic earth processes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357558","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049324/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tandem-L: A mission proposal for monitoring dynamic earth processes","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050064S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6049349,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Parizzi","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Agency, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Parizzi","id":"37596648100"},{"name":"Ramon Brcic","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Agency, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Brcic","id":"37285065300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049349","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Backscatter","Remote sensing","Image resolution","Kernel","Scattering","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase estimation","radar interferometry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude based INSAR stack multilooking","interferometric phase estimation","complex correlation","SAR Interferometry","coherent averaging","backscatter amplitude statistics","phase signature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","interferometry","radar backscatter statistics","coherence estimation","adaptive multilooking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049349","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049349.pdf","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude based InSAR stack multi-looking: Performance and applications","abstract":"Efficient estimation of the interferometric phase and complex correlation is fundamental for the full exploitation of SAR Interferometry capabilities [1].

Very often, however, owing to low spatial resolution of the scanner or to the presence of intimate mixtures (mixing of the materials at a very small scale) in the scene, the spectral vectors (collection of signals acquired at different spectral bands from a given pixel) acquired by the hyperspectral scanners are actually mixtures of the spectral signatures of the materials present in the scene. Given a set of mixed spectral vectors, spectral mixture analysis (or spectral unmixing) aims at estimating the number of reference materials, also called endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their fractional abundances. Spectral unmixing is, thus, a source separation problem. This paper presents an overview of the principal research directions in hyperspectral unmixing. The paper is organized into six main topics: i) mixing models, ii) signal subspace identification, iii) geometrical-based spectral unmixing, iv) statistical-based spectral unmixing, v) sparse regression based unmixing, and vi) spatial-contextual information. For each topic, we summarize what is the mathematical problem involved and give relevant pointers to state-of-the-art algorithms to address these problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357628","htmlLink":"/document/6049397/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An overview on hyperspectral unmixing: Geometrical, statistical, and sparse regression based approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview on hyperspectral unmixing: Geometrical, statistical, and sparse regression based approaches","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066642S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049461,"authors":[{"name":"Safa Khazai","affiliation":["Department of Surveying and Geomatics Engineering, University Colleges of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Safa","lastName":"Khazai","id":"37847606400"},{"name":"Abdolreza Safari","affiliation":["Department of Surveying and Geomatics Engineering, University Colleges of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolreza","lastName":"Safari","id":"37844791200"},{"name":"Barat Mojaradi","affiliation":["Department of Surveying and Geomatics Engineering, University Colleges of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Barat","lastName":"Mojaradi","id":"37847606300"},{"name":"Saeid Homayouni","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Homayouni","id":"37856834900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049461","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"The general objective of anomaly detection (AD) in hyperspectral imagery is to detect full-pixel targets.

The ambiguity often appears as the rotational point in the phase map which are called singular points (SPs). One of the origins of the SPs is the local distortion of the master and the slave, the source of interferogram. To solve this problem, we previously proposed a local co-registration method which employs the SPs as the evaluation criterion(SPEC method).

In order to make SVM work effectively one challenge is selection of training samples. In supervised classification it is generally done by random sampling for cross validation where two issues must be addressed. One is how many training samples required to allow SVM to produce good performance and the other is how to deal with random selections of training samples which produce inconsistent results. This paper presents a new type of SVM, called iterative SVM (ISVM) to address these two issues. The idea is to implement an SVM iteratively in such a way that the sample size is not necessarily to be large while the random sampling issue can be also resolved. To substantiate the utility of ISVM Purdue data is further used for experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049565","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049565.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative support vector machine for hyperspectral image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative support vector machine for hyperspectral image classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049565/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357784","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative support vector machine for hyperspectral image classification","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049811S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6049568,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfei Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37401258700"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, China"],"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049568","dbTime":"90 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"abstract":"In this paper, a sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on differential evolution is proposed, namely adaptive differential evolution sub-pixel mapping algorithm (ADESM). In ADESM, the sub-pixel mapping problem becomes one of assigning land cover classes to the sub-pixels while maximizing the spatial dependence index (SDI). In the proposed ADESM algorithm, individuals are represented as a discrete sub-pixel mapping solution by discrete encoding strategy. These individuals are improved by enhanced evolution operators, e.g., mutation, crossover, repair, exchange, insertion, and an effective local search to generate new candidate solutions. Furthermore, ADESM may adaptively obtain the optimal sub-pixel mapping result without user-defined parameters by adaptive parameter-setting strategy. The proposed method was tested using the synthetic real imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperform traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms, and hence provide an effective option for sub-pixel mapping of remote sensing imagery.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049568.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1727","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on adaptive differential evolution for remote sensing imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Mathematical model","Cities and towns","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","remote sensing","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive differential evolution subpixel mapping algorithm","land cover classes","spatial dependence index","ADESM algorithm","discrete subpixel mapping solution","discrete encoding strategy","evolution operators","optimal subpixel mapping","adaptive parameter-setting strategy","synthetic real imagery","remote sensing imagery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sub-pixel mapping","remote sensing","differential evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on adaptive differential evolution for remote sensing imagery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357787","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on adaptive differential evolution for remote sensing imagery","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045946S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049653,"authors":[{"name":"G.

If the RFI produces a detectable increase in the power detected by the radiometer it can be flagged and data discarded, but when the RFI is comparable or smaller than the natural variability, it is difficult to detect, and the retrieved geophysical parameters become erroneous [1]. A wavelet-based RFI-mitigation technique is implemented in hardware. The interfering signal is estimated by using the powerful denoising capabilities of the wavelet transform. Then, this estimate of the RFI signal is subtracted from the total received signal to obtain a RFI-mitigated noise signal [2]. The system data output rate is the same as the data input rate, allowing continuous mode operation without saturating memory.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave

Feature subset selection is an effective approach to alleviate the curse of dimensionality when the number of features contained in datasets is huge. Considering the merits of genetic algorithms (GA) in solving combinatorial problems, GA is becoming an increasingly popular tool for feature subset selection. Most algorithms presented in the literature using GA for feature subset selection use the training classification accuracy of a specific algorithm as the fitness function to optimize over the space of possible feature subsets. Such algorithms require a large amount of time to search for an optimal feature subset. In this paper, we will present a new approach called Genetic Algorithm based Linear Discriminant Analysis (GA-LDA) to extract features in which feature selection and feature extraction are performed simultaneously to alleviate over-dimensionality and result in a useful and robust feature space. Experimental results with classification tasks involving both hyperspectral imagery and SAR data indicate that GA-LDA can result in very low-dimensional feature subspaces yielding high classification accuracies.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049687","startPage":"2373","endPage":"2376","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis based dimensionality reduction for remotely sensed image analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049687/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis based dimensionality reduction for remotely sensed image analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049687/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12357866","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis based dimensionality reduction for remotely sensed image analysis","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084708S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6049719,"authors":[{"name":"Shanjun Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Geo-informatics & Digital Mine Research, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shanjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406040800"},{"name":"Yuntao Ma","affiliation":["Institute for Geo-informatics & Digital Mine Research, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37894590400"},{"name":"Lixin Wu","affiliation":["Institute for Geo-informatics & Digital Mine Research, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Academe of Disaster Reduction and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402839000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049719","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earthquakes","Microwave theory and techniques","Rocks","Microwave radiometry","Remote sensing","Brightness temperature","Meteorology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthquakes","fracture","geology","geophysical techniques","remote sensing","seismology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite remote sensing information","thermal infrared anomaly","water vapor anomaly","geological condition","microwave radiation anomaly","Wenchuan Earthquake","AMER-E satellite remote sensing data","anomaly analysis","main shock","anomaly mechanism","microwave brightness temperature","plastic stage","elastic stage","fracturing stage","China"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["earthquake","microwave radiation anomaly","remote sensing","AMER-E"]}],"abstract":"Some authors reported that there were anomalies appearing in the satellite remote sensing information before earthquake, including thermal infrared anomaly, water vapor anomaly and microwave anomaly etc. But how to obtain the actual anomaly from the complicated remote sensing information is very difficult due to the influencing of many factors, such as terrain, physiognomy, geological condition, and weather etc. Meanwhile the explaining of anomaly mechanism is another difficultly. In this paper, a new method is proposed to extract the microwave radiation anomaly before Wenchuan earthquake from the AMER-E satellite remote sensing data. The method can eliminate the influencing of terrain, physiognomy and weather. The result of anomaly analysis shows that there was microwave anomaly before and after the main shock of Wenchuan earthquake. In order to explore the anomaly mechanism a physical simulation experiment was carried out. The experimental result shows that the microwave brightness temperature increases in the elastic stage, decreases in the plastic stage, and increases again in the fracturing stage. Based on the experimental result the anomaly mechanism is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049719","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049719.pdf","startPage":"2500","endPage":"2503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Wenchuan earthquake and its mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049719/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Wenchuan earthquake and its mechanism","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357897","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049719/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Wenchuan earthquake and its mechanism","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059599S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049758,"authors":[{"name":"Yueguan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yueguan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598440800"},{"name":"Bingchen Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292024500"},{"name":"Wen Hong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hong","id":"37290656000"},{"name":"Yirong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yirong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293505200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049758","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Image reconstruction","Radar polarimetry","Compressed sensing","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar antennas","radar imaging","radar resolution","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["displaced phase center antenna SAR imaging","compressed sensing","synthetic aperture radar","high azimuth resolution","wide swath","pulse repletion frequency","innovative imaging algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Resolution Wide Swath","Displaced Phase Center Antenna","Compressive Sensing","Azimuth Ambiguity","Doppler Spectrum Reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"The displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the potential to achieve high azimuth resolution and wide swath.

We propose an innovative imaging algorithm based on compressed sensing (CS) which can reconstruct the scene well even though this rigid condition is not satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049758","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049758.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Displaced phase center antenna SAR imaging based on compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049758/","displayDocTitle":"Displaced phase center antenna SAR imaging based on compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357936","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049758/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Displaced phase center antenna SAR imaging based on compressed sensing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067898S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6049759,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan You","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, 100191, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"You"},{"name":"Chunsheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, 100191, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Ze Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, 100191, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Yu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049759","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"abstract":"Traditional radar utilizes Shannon-Nyquist theorem for high bandwidth signal sampling, which induces the complicated system. Compressive sensing (CS) indicates that the compressible signal using a few measurements can be reconstructed by solving a convex optimization problem. Thus, the huge amount of data according to high Shannon Nyquist rate is significantly reduced by compressive sensing. Parallel frequency radar theoretically cannot degrade the resolution compared with a traditional radar system and effectively reduces the sampling rate. In this paper, we focus on the data processing of the novel radar system. Basing on a sufficient structure, an algorithm of target scene reconstruction in pursuance of compressive sensing applied to the novel radar is proposed. Several simulations demonstrate the feasibility and the superiority of parallel frequency radar via compressive sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049759.pdf","startPage":"2696","endPage":"2699","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel frequency radar via compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Radar imaging","Azimuth","Imaging","Matching pursuit algorithms","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","information theory","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel frequency radar","compressive sensing","Shannon-Nyquist theorem","high bandwidth signal sampling","convex optimization problem","data processing","target scene reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","parallel frequency radar","radar signal processing","simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel frequency radar via compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049759/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12357937","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel frequency radar via compressive sensing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043948S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049760,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandra Budillon","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Parthenope, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Budillon","id":"37283845200"},{"name":"Gilda Schirinzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Parthenope, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Gilda","lastName":"Schirinzi","id":"37284811000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Orbits","Image reconstruction","Signal resolution","Reflectivity","Tomography","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image reconstruction","image resolution","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artifact reduction","SAR compressive sampling tomography","3D SAR imaging technique","elevation resolution","3D image reconstruction","COSMO-Skymed simulated data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","SAR tomography","Compressive Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a 3-D SAR imaging technique based on Compressive Sampling (CS) has been introduced .

The fusion of a HR panchromatic and the corresponding LR spectral channels is called \"pan-sharpening\". It aims at obtaining a high resolution multispectral image. In this paper, we propose a new sophisticated pan-sharpening method named Sparse Fusion of Images (SparseFI, pronounced as sparsify). SparseFI is based on the compressive sensing theory and explore the sparse representation of HR/LR multispectral image patches in the dictionaries pairs co-trained from the panchromatic image and its corresponding down-sampled version. Compared to other methods it \"learns\" from, i.e. adapts itself to, the data and has better performance than existing methods. Due to the fact that the SparseFI algorithm does not assume any model of the panchromatic image and thanks to the super-resolution capability and robustness of compressive sensing, it gives higher spatial and spectral resolution with less spectral distortion compared to the conventional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for image fusion - with application to pan-sharpening","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049794","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6034618/6048881/06049794.pdf","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6049794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6049794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for image fusion - with application to pan-sharpening","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6049794/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12375927","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for image fusion - with application to pan-sharpening","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058598S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6034618","isNumber":"6048881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6034618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6048881","articleId":"6049794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6049811,"authors":[{"name":"Riafeni Karlina","affiliation":["Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Riafeni","lastName":"Karlina","id":"37680656600"},{"name":"Motoyuki Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoyuki","lastName":"Sato","id":"37276052600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1005-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1003-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1004-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6049811","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":361},"abstract":"Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR) has been used to show the difference in polarimetric behavior of a metal sphere object located in different azimuth positions.

Currently most assimilation processes compute retrieval variances or error-covariance matrices as ensemble averages over diverse profiles, or simply flag problematic retrievals. Although retrieval accuracies vary considerable from profile to profile because of clouds, even in cloud-free cases they can differ markedly. The ability to estimate accurately the variances of individual profiles is one of the benefits of hyperspectral infrared and microwave sounding. The variance-estimating neural network was trained to estimate the logarithm of variance, which was then mapped to standard deviation. Examples utilizing AIRS/AMSU/HSB soundings [1] on the NASA Aqua satellite and those from a proposed hyperspectral microwave sounder [2], [3] show that when the predicted rms errors for a single altitude are stratified, they agree with the actual rms errors within perhaps ten percent of the dynamic range of the stratifications thus significantly improving the potential for accurately weighting soundings against model parameters during assimilation. Simple quality indicators using the new variance estimates also favorably compare to AIRS Level 2 Version 5 quality flags.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049917","startPage":"3269","endPage":"3272","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing

Using this algorithm, 500m MODIS data are downscaled to 100m based on maximal mutual information. By synergy of MODIS and HJ-1A HSI data, we obtained 100m \u00d7 100m aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm over Beijing City, on April 5, 2009. Comparison with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurement data, our results have good precision. The correlation coefficient is about 0.86 and the uncertainty is found to be \u0394\u03c4 = \u00b10.01 \u00b1 0.23\u03c4. From 100m AOD map, we can see more details of aerosols' spatial distribution.

Its independence of a runway, low cost, and rapid turn-around time for imagery make it an efficient platform for applications in riparian areas and in wetlands management. Using third-party software, the imagery from AggieAir can be stitched together into mosaics, georeferenced, and used to classify vegetation and map riparian systems, substrates and fish habitat for hydraulic modeling, river morphology and restoration monitoring. Likewise, the multispectral mosaics can be used to monitor changes in meso-scale aquatic habitat features and invasive/native plant species, as well as delineate different types of wetlands for wetlands management. This paper introduces AggieAir and highlights some of the projects in riparian and wetlands applications in which it has been involved.
