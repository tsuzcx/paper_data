Thus, OFDM has been adopted for high speed data transmission of multimedia traffic. However, OFDM also has a drawback of a high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR). This high PAPR takes place due to parallel processing of a number of data at once using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor. Due to this high PAPR amplifier usually does not act in dynamic range. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can reduce PAPR using selective mapping (SLM) in impulsive noise channel. In order to utilize SLM technique, side information needs to be transmitted for demodulation while degrading transmission efficiency. We propose and analyze scaled SLM technique which removes necessity of the side information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in impulsive noise channel","publicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4801868/4809880/04810000.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4809880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in impulsive noise channel","conferenceDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/4810000/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10560940","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in impulsive noise channel","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"03B-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046485S","chronDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4801868","isNumber":"4809880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4809880","articleId":"4810000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4810001,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Hui","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bing Hui","id":"37408989500"},{"name":"KyungHi Chang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"KyungHi Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-138-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-139-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4810001","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","OFDM","Fading","Bit error rate","Gain","Delay systems","Frequency diversity","System performance","Channel state information","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","delays","OFDM modulation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic delay diversity","linear precoding technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","time-division-duplex OFDM systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic Delay Diversity","Linear Precoding","OFDM","Reciprocity","Frequency-Division-Duplex (FDD)","TDD"]}],"abstract":"Cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is considered a simple approach to exploit the frequency diversity, to improve the system performance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

However, the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing is destructively impaired, when the reporting and inter-user channels both inevitably experience fading besides the detecting channel in reality. To solve this problem, we propose a robust scheme, called dynamic multi-head selection based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. Our scheme utilizes both the multi-user selection diversity and the inter-user transmission error comparison jointly, to reduce the transmission error of sensing messages over fading channels. Meanwhile, our scheme is also designed to save the total transmit energy efficiently during its execution. This benefit is due to the hierarchical reporting manner and the adaptive transmit power option adopted in our scheme. Simulation results show that the sensing performance and energy efficiency can both be improved significantly by our scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810033/","isConference":true,"volume":"01","accessionNumber":"10600660","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810033/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A robust and energy efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust and energy efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"04A-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069379S","chronDate":"15-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4801868","isNumber":"4809880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801868","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4809880","articleId":"4810033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810040,"authors":[{"name":"Xiupei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Xiupei Zhang","id":"37537480500"},{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","id":"37278285300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-138-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-139-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4810040","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filling","Throughput","Frequency diversity","Degradation","Jamming","Spread spectrum communication","OFDM modulation","Transmitters","Fading","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency hop communication","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water filling algorithm","throughput improvement","frequency hopping system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","OFDM system","multipath channel","jamming channel","adaptive bit loading technique","multipath propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Water filling algorithm","FH-OFDM","throughput","multipath propagation"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the throughput, the water filling algorithm is considered in the FH- OFDM (frequency hopping - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) system which combines frequency hopping technique and OFDM technique.

A CFO estimation algorithm is developed by exploring the time-frequency structure of specially designed training symbols, and it provides a very accurate estimation of the CFO in the presence of both unknown frequency-selective fading and phase noise. Based on the estimated CFO, phase noise and frequency-selective fading are jointly estimated by employing the maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n (MAP) criterion. Specifically, the fading channel is estimated in the form of the frequency-domain CTF. The estimation of the CTF eliminates the requirement of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge of channel length, and it is simpler compared with the time-domain channel impulse response (CIR) estimation methods used in the literature. Theoretical analysis with the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that the proposed CFO and CTF estimation algorithms can achieve near-optimum performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04810119.pdf","startPage":"4380","endPage":"4387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Channel Transfer Function and Carrier Frequency Offset for OFDM Systems With Phase Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Phase estimation","Transfer functions","OFDM","Phase noise","Fading","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency division multiplexing","Time frequency analysis","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","frequency estimation","frequency selective surfaces","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","phase noise","time-frequency analysis","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel transfer function estimation","carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDM systems","phase noise","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","time-frequency structure","frequency-selective fading channel","maximum a posteriori criterion","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","channel estimation","channel transfer function (CTF)","maximum a posteriori (MAP)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","phase noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Channel Transfer Function and Carrier Frequency Offset for OFDM Systems With Phase Noise","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4810119/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903036","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Channel Transfer Function and Carrier Frequency Offset for OFDM Systems With Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2020066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067667S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4810119","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4810120,"authors":[{"name":"Haojin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4810120/4810120-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haojin Zhu (M'09) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2009.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

In DTNs, the intermediate nodes on a communication path are expected to store, carry, and forward the in-transit messages (or bundles) in an opportunistic way, which is called opportunistic data forwarding. Such a forwarding method depends on the hypothesis that each individual node is ready to forward packets for others. This assumption, however, might easily be violated due to the existence of selfish or even malicious nodes, which may be unwilling to waste their precious wireless resources to serve as bundle relays. To address this problem, we propose a secure multilayer credit-based incentive scheme to stimulate bundle forwarding cooperation among DTN nodes. The proposed scheme can be implemented in a fully distributed manner to thwart various attacks without relying on any tamperproof hardware. In addition, we introduce several efficiency optimization techniques to improve the overall efficiency by exploiting the unique characteristics of DTNs. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903034","htmlLink":"/document/4810120/","displayDocTitle":"SMART: A Secure Multilayer Credit-Based Incentive Scheme for Delay-Tolerant Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMART: A Secure Multilayer Credit-Based Incentive Scheme for Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-shen-2020105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077124S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4810120","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810121,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Ramadan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Ramadan","id":"37284488200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4810121","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Equations","Two dimensional displays","Perfectly matched layers","Optical scattering","Boundary conditions","Circuit stability","Conductivity","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","wave equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-D FDTD simulation","finite-difference time-domain problem","implicit 4-stage alternating direction implicit wave-equation","PML","perfectly matched layer algorithm","computational time","memory storage requirement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Perfectly matched layer (PML)","split-step alternating direction implicit (ADI)","wave-equation finite difference time domain (WE-FDTD)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an implicit four-stage alternating direction implicit wave-equation perfectly matched layer (4S-ADI-WEPML) algorithm is presented for source-free two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) problems.

To achieve highly reliable data transmission, wireless mobile networks require efficient reliable link connectivity, regardless of terminal mobility and, thus, a reliable traffic performance. Mobile networks consist of mobile hosts, base stations, links, etc. that are often vulnerable to failure. It is desirable to design a reliable network, in terms of services of both the base stations and the communication channels of the network, for the reliable transmission of the data. An attempt is made to employ those channels that offer a reliable communication at any given time. The objective of this study is to design an appropriate reliability-based model for channel allocation that retains the overall system reliability with acceptable system performance. The system may achieve acceptable performance not only during normal operations but also under various component failures. A genetic algorithm, which is a search procedure based on evolutionary computation, is suited to solve a class of complex optimization problems. The potential of the genetic algorithm is used, in this paper, to improve the reliability of the mobile communication system. The proposed model designs a reliable mobile communication system, irrespective of the mobile hosts that change their position due to mobility. A simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm is conducted, and results reveal the effectiveness of this model.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2019666","startPage":"4248","endPage":"4256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2019666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04810134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Based Channel Allocation Using Genetic Algorithm in Mobile Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810134/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Based Channel Allocation Using Genetic Algorithm in Mobile Computing","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4810134/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903023","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Based Channel Allocation Using Genetic Algorithm in Mobile Computing","sourcePdf":"tvt-vidyarthi-2019666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103955S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4810134","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4810136,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Tao Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4810136/4810136-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung-Tao Hsieh (S'08) received the B.S. degree in physics in 2000 from the National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree in electro-physics in 2002 from the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Communication Engineering.","His research interests include detection/estimation theories and communication signal processing."]},"firstName":"Hung-Tao","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"38246347400"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4810136/4810136-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Rong Wu (M'89) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980 and the M.S. degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York, Buffalo, in 1985, 1986, and 1989, respectively.","Since August 1989, he has been a faculty member with the Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

To facilitate these operations, a periodic preamble is often placed at the beginning of a packet. CFO estimation has been extensively studied for the case of two-period preambles. In some applications, however, a preamble with more than two periods is available. A typical example is the IEEE802.11a/g wireless local area network system, which features a ten-period preamble. Recently, researchers have proposed a maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimation method for such systems. This approach first estimates the received preamble using a least squares method and then maximizes the corresponding likelihood function. In addition to the standard calculations, this method requires an extra procedure to solve the roots of a polynomial function, which is disadvantageous for real-world implementations. In this paper, we propose a new ML method to solve the likelihood function directly and thereby perform CFO estimation. Our method can obtain a closed-form ML solution, without the need for the root-finding step. We further extend the proposed method to address the STO estimation problem as well as derive a lower bound on the estimation performance. Our simulations show that while the performance of the proposed method is either equal to or better than the existing method, the computational complexity is lower.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04810136.pdf","startPage":"4224","endPage":"4237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2019820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2019820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Periodic Preambles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Timing","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Wireless LAN","Least squares methods","Polynomials","Computational modeling","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency estimation","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","symbol timing offset estimation","carrier frequency offset estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless local area network system","IEEE802.11a/g","least squares method","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency offset","maximum likelihood (ML)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Periodic Preambles","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4810136/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10926918","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Likelihood Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Periodic Preambles","sourcePdf":"tvt-hsieh-2019820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078587S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4810136","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4810137,"authors":[{"name":"Suyoun Lee","affiliation":["Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suyoun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407203200"},{"name":"Jeung-hyun Jeong","affiliation":["Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeung-hyun","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37309416000"},{"name":"Taek Sung Lee","affiliation":["Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taek Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37365508000"},{"name":"Won Mok Kim","affiliation":["Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won Mok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309381800"},{"name":"Byung-ki Cheong","affiliation":["Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-ki","lastName":"Cheong","id":"37321660400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4810137","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":805},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"Using a phase-change memory (PCM) device composed of Ge\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nSb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\ne\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sub>\n (GST), we studied the mechanism of the SET-stuck failure (SSF), a constantly low-resistance state during write/erase (W/E) cycling.

These pure signatures are then used to decompose the scene into abundance fractions by means of a spectral unmixing algorithm. Most techniques available in the endmember extraction literature rely on exploiting the spectral properties of the data alone. As a result, the search for endmembers in a scene is conducted by treating the data as a collection of spectral measurements with no spatial arrangement. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to incorporate spatial information into the traditional spectral-based endmember search process. Specifically, we propose to estimate, for each pixel vector, a scalar spatially derived factor that relates to the spectral similarity of pixels lying within a certain spatial neighborhood. This scalar value is then used to weigh the importance of the spectral information associated to each pixel in terms of its spatial context. Two key aspects of the proposed methodology are given as follows: 1) No modification of existing image spectral-based endmember extraction methods is necessary in order to apply the proposed approach. 2) The proposed preprocessing method enhances the search for image spectral endmembers in spatially homogeneous areas. Our experimental results, which were obtained using both synthetic and real hyperspectral data sets, indicate that the spectral endmembers obtained after spatial preprocessing can be used to accurately model the original hyperspectral scene using a linear mixture model. The proposed approach is suitable for jointly combining spectral and spatial information when searching for image-derived endmembers in highly representative hyperspectral image data sets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Preprocessing for Endmember Extraction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2014945","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165149/04810138.pdf","startPage":"2679","endPage":"2693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2014945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Preprocessing for Endmember Extraction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4810138/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764031","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Preprocessing for Endmember Extraction","sourcePdf":"tgrs-plaza-2014945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227135S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5165149","articleId":"4810138","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4810142,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Palmese","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5071752/4810142/4810142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maria Palmese (S'04\u2013M'05) was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1976.

The method most frequently used to process the acquired signals is a beamforming algorithm. In general, owing to the high number of sensors and beam signals, the computational load is prohibitive for real-time image generation. An efficient frequency beamforming implementation based on the use of the chirp zeta transform (CZT) has been proposed in the literature for the case involving linear arrays. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to perform CZT beamforming on the wideband signals collected by a planar array generated by a scene placed in the far field. This extension becomes simpler and more intuitive thanks to a nonconventional method of defining the azimuth and elevation angles. In terms of computational complexity, the analysis compares the solution developed with traditional beamforming techniques carried out in both time and frequency domains, showing several advantages for the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2015523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5071752/04810142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2015523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071752","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Acoustic Imaging by Chirp Zeta Transform Digital Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Acoustic Imaging by Chirp Zeta Transform Digital Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10728356","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Acoustic Imaging by Chirp Zeta Transform Digital Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tim-trucco-2015523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058138S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5071752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5071752","articleId":"4810142","onlineDate":"03 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4810144,"authors":[{"name":"Paul C.

This method involves the injection of voltage signals at the carrier frequency for reconstructing the phase currents in PWM inverters using a single current sensor in the DC-link. It uses minimum signals to reduce the voltage and current harmonics caused by the injected signals. The vector of the injected voltage is at a minimum distance from the original reference to ensure the measurement time in the reconstruction of the phase currents. An injection sequence control method is also proposed to avoid an abrupt change in the injection signals. A PWM scheme for splitting phase voltages is proposed to reduce any audible noise, especially in low-speed operation. The proposed method reconstructs the phase currents with signals from a single current sensor and minimizes the amplitude of the injected signals to reduce the harmonics at audible noise frequencies in the injection signals.

But the well known performance anomaly of 802.11 still remains an open issue. A mobile station tends to change its modulation and coding scheme and transmit at lower bit rate due to the signal fading and interference. Besides, the 802.11 commercial devices adopt a simple First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheduler without isolating the traffic flows addressed to different destinations. These have lead to a problem: whenever one or more stations transmit at lower bit rate, the performance of all the stations is heavily degraded. Our experimental results have pinpointed this problem. To counteract this problem, we propose an easy to deploy and portable solution to be implemented in the 802.11n base station, known as anomaly-aware IP scheduler with admission control. This cross-layer approach requires no modification to the current 802.11 standard and runs on top of the Linux kernel. The experimental results have shown the feasibility of our solution in minimizing the performance anomaly problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810209/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10559977","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810209/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly-aware IP Scheduler with Admission Control for 802.11n Base Station","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly-aware IP Scheduler with Admission Control for 802.11n Base Station","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"HONET-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03281S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4805631","isNumber":"4810195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805631","xplore-issue":"4810195","articleId":"4810209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4810242,"authors":[{"name":"Kavan K.

We also show that, once the total area dedicated to sensing is chosen, the lifetime prediction uncertainty is almost insensitive to the tradeoff between the number of sensors and the area of each individual sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810261","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small embeddable NBTI sensors (SENS) for tracking on-chip performance decay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small embeddable NBTI sensors (SENS) for tracking on-chip performance decay","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810261/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559809","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810261/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small embeddable NBTI sensors (SENS) for tracking on-chip performance decay","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1A.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053342S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4810264,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293645500"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674524800"},{"name":"Wenping Wang","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Wenping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292861300"},{"name":"Varsha Balakrishnan","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Varsha","lastName":"Balakrishnan","id":"37663109000"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277285000"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Department of E.E., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810264","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":631},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Degradation","Circuit optimization","Negative bias temperature instability","MOSFETs","Aging","Threshold voltage","MOS devices","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NBTI effects","leakage power","aging effect","negative bias temperature instability","reliability","circuit designers","mitigation techniques","NBTI-induced circuit degradation","standby leakage power","input vector control technique","circuit aging","circuit performance degradation","Pareto sets","life-time reliability","size 90 nm","size 65 nm","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)","input vector control (IVC)","leakage power reduction"]}],"abstract":"As technology scales, the aging effect caused by Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability concerns for circuit designers. Consequently, we have seen a lot of research efforts on NBTI analysis and mitigation techniques. On the other hand, reducing leakage power remains to be one of the major design goals. Both NBTI-induced circuit degradation and standby leakage power have a strong dependency on the input patterns of circuits. In this paper, we propose a co-simulation flow to study NBTI-induced circuit degradation and leakage power, taking into account the different behaviors between circuit active and standby time. Based on this flow, we evaluate the efficacy of Input Vector Control (IVC) technique on mitigating circuit aging and reducing standby leakage power with experiments on bench-mark circuits that are implemented in 90 nm, 65 nm, and 45 nm technology nodes. The IVC technique is proved to be effective to mitigate NBTI-induced circuit degradation, saving up to 56% circuit performance degradation at 65 nm technology node, and on average 30% circuit performance degradation across different technology nodes. Meanwhile, IVC technique can save up to 18% of the worst case leak-age power. Since leakage power and NBTI-induced circuit degradation have different dependencies on the input patterns, we propose to derive Pareto sets for designers to explore trade-offs between the life-time reliability and leakage power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the efficacy of input Vector Control to mitigate NBTI effects and leakage power","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810264","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810264.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the efficacy of input Vector Control to mitigate NBTI effects and leakage power","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810264/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586713","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the efficacy of input Vector Control to mitigate NBTI effects and leakage power","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1A.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077668S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4810265,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This test chip, fabricated in a state-of-the-art 45 nm process node technology, addresses the important issues of variability in power and delay and quantifies them as a function of voltage and cycle time. Multiple power-saving techniques are implemented on-chip to facilitate the analysis. The uniqueness of the chip lies in: a) the use of 64 AES core-based processing-element (PE) blocks that are identical, independently controllable and designed using a state-of-the-art power-aware design flow, b) the use of MTCMOS switches within each PE block combined with multiple power domains which results in excellent granularity of power measurements and, c) the implementation of separate voltage areas in each PE block which enables power measurements down to very low voltages. Good correlation was established between measured data and simulations. Estimates of within-die and die-to-die delay variability were also quantified through measurements of Vddmin, the minimum voltage for functionality. For the silicon tested, the analysis of Vddmin revealed significant within-die variations which were similar in magnitude to the die-to-die variations seen. A methodology to use the Vddmin variation to estimate on-chip delay variability is described in detail.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810265","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810265.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power & variability test chip architecture and 45nm-generation silicon-based analysis for robust, power-aware SoC design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810265/","displayDocTitle":"Power & variability test chip architecture and 45nm-generation silicon-based analysis for robust, power-aware SoC design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586714","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810265/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power & variability test chip architecture and 45nm-generation silicon-based analysis for robust, power-aware SoC design","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1B.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045193S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4810267,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Yao","id":"37087356421"},{"name":"Yiyu Shi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yiyu Shi","id":"37087070877"},{"name":"Lei He","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lei He","id":"37087065914"},{"name":"Sudhakar Pamarti","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhakar","lastName":"Pamarti","id":"37297591300"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Hu","id":"37087263156"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810267","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing jitter","Noise level","Crosstalk","Intersymbol interference","Filters","Data communication","Noise measurement","Signal analysis","SPICE","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","crosstalk","intersymbol interference","mathematical programming","microstrip lines","Monte Carlo methods","SPICE","timing jitter","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing jitter","amplitude noise","differential signaling","inter-symbol interference","crosstalk","mathematical programming algorithms","Monte Carlo simulation","SPICE simulation","transceiver","high speed data communications","eye diagram","differential microstrip line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmission line","Jitter","Amplitude noise","Modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810267","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810267.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst case timing jitter and amplitude noise in differential signaling","abstract":"Differential signaling is widely used in high speed data communications. Inter-symbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk between differential pair, however, heavily affect the integrity of differential signaling as measured by timing jitter and amplitude noise in the eye diagram. To reduce the impact of ISI, a pre-emphasis filter is commonly used, but it increases the crosstalk noise. In this paper, we first propose formula-based jitter and noise models considering the combined effect of ISI, crosstalk, and pre-emphasis filter. With given input patterns, our models achieve within 5% difference compared to SPICE simulation. Moreover, using the formula-based models, we develop mathematical programming algorithms to directly find out the input patterns for worst-case jitter and worstcase amplitude noise. Experiments show our algorithms obtain more reliable worst-case jitter and noise compared to Monte Carlo simulation and reduce runtime by 150times.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810267/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559812","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Worst case timing jitter and amplitude noise in differential signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst case timing jitter and amplitude noise in differential signaling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA","sourcePdf":"1B.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063887S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4810269,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37424009100"},{"name":"Alireza Kasnavi","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Kasnavi","id":"37298444500"},{"name":"Harold Levy","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Harold","lastName":"Levy","id":"38122714400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810269","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810269","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Software libraries","Polynomials","Shape","Semiconductor device modeling","Delay","CMOS digital integrated circuits","Digital circuits","Robustness","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general piecewise nonlinear library modeling","size reduction","gate-level timing","SI analysis","power analysis","variation analysis","standard cell libraries","CMOS digital circuit designs","nonlinear delay model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Standard Cell","Library","Compression","Delay Calculation","SI","Power","Variation","Gate-level Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810269","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810269.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general piece-wise nonlinear library modeling format and size reduction technique for gate-level timing, SI, power, and variation analysis","abstract":"Standard cell libraries are used extensively in CMOS digital circuit designs. In the past ten years, standard cell library size has increased by more than 10X. Reducing the library size is becoming a must. In this paper, we present an efficient piece-wise nonlinear library modeling format and library size reduction technique. Instead of using tables and vectors, this format uses base templates (curve or surface templates) to model the shape of curves or surfaces. It works very well for standard cells that exhibit similar behaviors. It is also efficient because the shape can be modeled by a single id. This technique can be applied to timing, SI, power, and variation modeling. It can be directly applied to the traditional nonlinear delay model (NLDM) and the recently developed current source models. This paper also presents a fast method for efficiently selecting the optimal template and detecting bad library data. Our technique uses standardized base templates and allows using any curves or shape functions as base templates. Base templates can be created as needed, and the optimal templates are selected during the model creation process. The fitting and modeling process becomes much simpler and more efficient. It avoids many difficult issues such nonlinear fitting or over-fitting. The modeling accuracy can be easily controlled. Because this format is simpler, using this format could also help speed up the calculation. Several examples are provided in this paper to show this technique is generic, robust, and efficient. Results show .lib library size can be reduced by 5~10X. Experiments using an industry-leading STA tool show the impact on accuracy is ignorable. This technique also help reduces STA tool memory usage and improves runtime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810269/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10586717","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810269/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A general piece-wise nonlinear library modeling format and size reduction technique for gate-level timing, SI, power, and variation analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general piece-wise nonlinear library modeling format and size reduction technique for gate-level timing, SI, power, and variation analysis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1C.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099955S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810273,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Augustine","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Augustine","id":"37392520200"},{"name":"Arijit Raychowdhury","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Raychowdhury","id":"37273985900"},{"name":"Yunfei Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Yunfei Gao","id":"37537325400"},{"name":"Mark Lundstrom","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Lundstrom","id":"37269116700"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810273","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit analysis","MOSFETs","Logic arrays","Nanoscale devices","Semiconductor devices","Power system modeling","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Circuit simulation","Logic gates","Logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","MOSFET","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge based emerging devices","PETE","system level evaluation"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes PETE, a tool that has been developed for circuit/system level evaluation of nanoscaled devices. The motivation behind developing this tool is the fact that traditional device metrics like CV/Ion, Ioff or CV\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nf can no longer capture the true potential of semiconductor devices and underestimate or overestimate system level performance. At the same time, the development and deployment of compact models for any new device is a time-consuming effort, a task that can only be undertaken once the potential of the de established. Towards this end, we have developed PETE, so that device and circuit designers can perform a fast and reasonably accurate estimation of any new device without having to develop compact models. The inputs to PETE can be numerical I-V and C-V characteristics (derived from experiments or device simulations), and the tool can numerically evaluate a wide array of circuit/system level metrics pertaining to performance and power of logic gates, ring oscillators and mega-cells. We have evaluated four emerging device technologies, namely, 15 nm Silicon MOSFET transistors, Multi transistors, Band-to-band-tunneling transistors, and Ferroelectric FETs with PETE and the results obtained are within a 5% level of inaccuracy when compared to a traditional SPICE based approach. PETE has been deployed on the nanoHUB (nanohub.org) for public use, and its simple web interface ensures that even a non-expert in circuits can obtain accurate estimation of performance-power trade new technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810273","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810273.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810273","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PETE: A device/circuit analysis framework for evaluation and comparison of charge based emerging devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"PETE: A device/circuit analysis framework for evaluation and comparison of charge based emerging devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810273/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559815","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PETE: A device/circuit analysis framework for evaluation and comparison of charge based emerging devices","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1D.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05482S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810274,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Anigundi","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Anigundi","id":"38111145500"},{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596251500"},{"name":"Jian-Qiang Lu","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jian-Qiang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278636500"},{"name":"Ken Rose","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Rose","id":"38194523700"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810274","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":646},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810274","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Bonding","Silicon","Packaging","Integrated circuit interconnections","Through-silicon vias","Delay","Wire","Wafer scale integration","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","energy consumption","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit yield","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integrated DRAM","architecture design exploration","pitch mismatch","DRAM word-line/bit-line","through silicon vias","potential yield loss","CACTI 5","coarse-grained 3D partitioning strategies","data I/O","energy consumption","memory redundancy repair simulator","storage capacity 1 Gbit","storage capacity 256 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D integration","DRAM"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by increasingly promising three-dimensional (3D) integration technologies, this paper reports an architecture design of 3D integrated dynamic RAM (DRAM). To accommodate the potentially significant pitch mismatch between DRAM word-line/bit-line and through silicon vias (TSVs) for 3D integration, this paper presents two modestly different coarse-grained inter-sub-array 3D DRAM architecture partitioning strategies. Furthermore, to mitigate the potential yield loss induced by 3D integration, we propose an interdie inter-sub-array redundancy repair approach to improve the memory repair success rate. For the purpose of evaluation, we modified CACTI 5 to support the proposed coarse-grained 3D partitioning strategies. Estimation results show that, for the realization of a 1 Gb DRAM with 8 banks and 256-bit data I/O, such 3D DRAM design strategies can effectively reduce the silicon area, access latency, and energy consumption compared with 3D packaging with wire bonding and conventional 2D design. We further developed a memory redundancy repair simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed inter-die inter-subarray redundancy repair approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810274","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810274.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture design exploration of three-dimensional (3D) integrated DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810274/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Architecture design exploration of three-dimensional (3D) integrated DRAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10559816","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810274/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture design exploration of three-dimensional (3D) integrated DRAM","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1D.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061598S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4810280,"authors":[{"name":"Charbel J.

We minimize positive timing slack for each cell according to its leakage vs. delay sensitivity, so that unnecessary leakage power consumption is saved without degrading circuit performance. A key difference between our work and previous works is that we pre-process timing libraries to estimate the linear relation - in every slew-load condition - between the gate delay and gate length by linear fitting; we then optimize total leakage power by estimating the optimal gate length for each gate using fast linear programming.

The first diagnosis algorithm, March D2, can be used to distinguish drowsy faults (DFs) from non-drowsy faults (NDFs). The second diagnosis algorithm, March D6, can distinguish different fault types of DFs. The March D2 and March D6 require 23N and (10log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nN+17)N Read/Write operations, respectively, for testing an N times W -bit drowsy SRAM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Fault diagnosis","Testing","Power supplies","System-on-a-chip","SRAM chips","Fault location","Fault detection","Dynamic voltage scaling","Failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory cores","system-on-chip","memory yield improvement","diagnosis algorithms","drowsy static random access memories"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810307","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810307","startPage":"276","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810307.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810307/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient diagnosis algorithms for drowsy SRAMs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10586739","htmlLink":"/document/4810307/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient diagnosis algorithms for drowsy SRAMs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2D.19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047642S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4810311,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Gao","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37575189900"},{"name":"David Zaretsky","affiliation":["Binachip, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zaretsky","id":"37265536500"},{"name":"Gaurav Mittal","affiliation":["Binachip, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37265555200"},{"name":"Dan Schonfeld","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Schonfeld","id":"37294984500"},{"name":"Prith Banerjee","affiliation":["Binachip, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Prith","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37069124300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810311","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A software pipelining algorithm in high-level synthesis for FPGA architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810311.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Software algorithms","High level synthesis","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","System buses","Digital signal processing","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software pipelining algorithm","high-level synthesis","FPGA architectures","modulo scheduling algorithm","memory lifetime holes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software pipelining","Modulo Scheduling","circular dependency","memory lifetime hole","memory address aliasing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810311","abstract":"In this paper, we present a variation of the Modulo Scheduling algorithm to exploit software pipelining in the high-level synthesis for FPGA architectures.

Due to its great scalability potential, phase change memory technology has recently attracted tremendous interest, and from storage density perspective the diode-switch phase change memory cell structure is highly desirable. Design of very high density diode-switch phase change memory faces at least two challenges at circuit and architecture levels, including (i) silicon area overhead of memory peripheral circuits must be minimized in order to push the effective storage density envelope, and (ii) conventional defect tolerance strategy using redundant row/column repair may no longer be applicable and new defect tolerance approach should be used. This paper presents possible solutions to address the above two issues. Very simple and cost-effective peripheral circuits including row/column decoders and sensing approach are developed, and a theoretical analysis of the impact of non-negligible reverse-bias diode leakage is also presented. Moreover, this paper presents a simple defect tolerance approach that combines coarse-grained redundancy repair and error correcting codes (ECC). Hypothetical memory design examples are further used to demonstrate the presented design techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810332/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10559841","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810332/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploratory study on circuit and architecture design of very high density diode-switch phase change memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploratory study on circuit and architecture design of very high density diode-switch phase change memories","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3D.04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04639S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4810338,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hye Bong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hye","lastName":"Bong","id":"38186519500"},{"name":"Yong-Jin Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Jin","lastName":"Kwon","id":"38187982900"},{"name":"Kyeong-Sik Min","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea","School of Engineering, University of California, Merced, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong-Sik","lastName":"Min","id":"37345681800"},{"name":"Sung-Mo Kang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of California, Merced, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Mo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37066338700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810338","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Subthreshold current","Voltage","Predictive models","Random access memory","Temperature","Energy consumption","Leakage current","Circuits","Switches","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","leakage currents","low-power electronics","power consumption","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM","word-line driving scheme","oxide-tunneling leakage","word-line-off voltage","voltage stress","Predictive Technology Modeling group","power consumption","read operation","static components","dynamic components","delay overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","leakage current","oxide-tunneling leakage","low-power SRAM","low-leakage SRAM"]}],"abstract":"A new word-line driving scheme is proposed in this paper for suppressing oxide-tunneling leakage in sub-65-nm devices. Reducing oxide-tunneling leakage is very essential in sub-65-nm era because of this tunneling leakage component becoming more and more serious comparing with the subthreshold component. In this paper, we propose to raise the word-line-off voltage higher than 0V thereby relaxing the voltage stress across the oxides. This scheme can reduce not only oxide-tunneling leakage but also switching power because of the swing voltage of the word line being reduced. This scheme has been verified using the 65-nm devices obtained from the Predictive Technology Modeling group. The comparison with the conventional circuit shows the power consumption of the proposed one is lowered by as much as 11%, 19.7%, and 39.9%, at 75\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and -25\u00b0C, respectively, when all the rows are in sleep. And, during the read operation, the power consumption including both static and dynamic components is lowered by as much as 8.3%, 10.4%, and 10.9%, at 75\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and -25\u00b0C, respectively. At the write operation, amounts of power saving reach 37.5%, 38.7%, and 41.1%, for 75\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and -25\u00b0C, respectively, while showing very little delay overhead of word-line driving.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New word-line driving scheme for suppressing oxide-tunneling leakage in sub-65-nm SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810338","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810338.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"New word-line driving scheme for suppressing oxide-tunneling leakage in sub-65-nm SRAMs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810338/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586755","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New word-line driving scheme for suppressing oxide-tunneling leakage in sub-65-nm SRAMs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3D.10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065058S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4810340,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we have investigated the effects of body bias and source bias in 65 nm technology through simulations on SRAM standby current (Isb). The simulation results show a 8X reduction in cell Isb at 125degC FF process corner with a 1.0 V NMOS body bias. This has been experimentally verified on a 16 Mb SRAM testchip. Source biasing is shown to be a more effective technique for room temperature leakage reduction (~3X lower Isb@0.4 V bias). Optimizing the SRAM cell is crucial to meet the product performance requirements across corners and a methodology for the same is also described. The 16 Mb testchip was characterized for read disturb, write margin and read current margin at process corners by applying forward and reverse body biases to shift the cell transistor parameters. Different test sequences tailored for the parameter being measured were used to determine the failing bit count in each case. Voltage schmoo plots were generated from the measured data to obtain the Vccmin at each body bias condition. Based on the above, the threshold voltages of the cell transistors for maximum operating margin were derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standby power reduction and SRAM cell optimization for 65nm technology","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810340","startPage":"471","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810340.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Standby power reduction and SRAM cell optimization for 65nm technology","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810340/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586757","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standby power reduction and SRAM cell optimization for 65nm technology","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3D.12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056631S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4810349,"authors":[{"name":"Zohreh Karimi","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Karimi","id":"37601768400"},{"name":"Majid Sarrafzadeh","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Sarrafzadeh","id":"37278987300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810349","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Tiles","Energy consumption","Timing","Logic","Histograms","Table lookup","Clocks","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","heuristic programming","integrated circuit design","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware placement algorithm","FPGAs","dual supply voltages","IC design","timing constrains","tiles","logic elements","heuristic algorithm","saving ratio","multiple supply voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical design","placement","low power","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Usage of multiple supply voltages has raised new design challenges in IC design. We focus on the problem of power aware placement when dual supply voltages provide two high performance and low power working modes on each FPGA tile. To meet timing constrains, all logic elements within a tile need to work in the high performance mode when at least one element within that tile has tight timing requirements. To save more energy, we propose a placement flow that enables more tiles and logic elements to work in the low power mode. We start with an initial placement that provides coarse timing requirements. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to select a subset of tiles to host critical elements. Considering the candidate hosts, a set of movements are generated and those with least cost overheads are accepted.

Further, traditional response surface model can not mimic circuit behaviors in global process/designable parameter space. This paper proposes using Kriging model combined with Latin hypercube sampling to build surrogate model of circuit performance. We firstly introduce and compare the response surface modeling based on traditional design of experiments and the Kriging modeling combined with Latin hypercube sampling, and then apply both methods to circuit performance surrogate-modeling of an integrated operational amplifier. The result shows that Kriging model needs less sample points and provides 2times higher accuracy than quadratic response surface model does.

The coarse grained partitioning of self-contained functional units achieved with RDS is suitable for early adoption of 3D technology as well as for long-term application to low cost system integration due to less redesign effort, design tool requirements, and better testability of each stratum before and after bonding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Die/wafer stacking with reciprocal design symmetry (RDS) for mask reuse in three-dimensional (3D) integration technology","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810357","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810357.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Die/wafer stacking with reciprocal design symmetry (RDS) for mask reuse in three-dimensional (3D) integration technology","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810357/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559849","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Die/wafer stacking with reciprocal design symmetry (RDS) for mask reuse in three-dimensional (3D) integration technology","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4A.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040011S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4810363,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37288680600"},{"name":"Rouwaida Kanj","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rouwaida","lastName":"Kanj","id":"37282284500"},{"name":"Kanak Agarwal","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kanak","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273761000"},{"name":"Zhuo Li","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Zhuo Li","id":"37279076700"},{"name":"Rajiv Joshi","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37273934800"},{"name":"Sani Nassif","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sani","lastName":"Nassif","id":"37276060600"},{"name":"Weiping Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Weiping","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278936700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810363","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lithography","Random access memory","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","Performance analysis","Uncertainty","Voltage","Manufacturing","Robustness","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","design for manufacture","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","lithography","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM cell","back-end-of-line design for manufacturability","lithography","SRAM simulation model","internal cell interconnect RC parasitics","stability yield","nonlinear device resistance"]}],"abstract":"With the feature size shrinking down to 65 nm and beyond, manufacturing process variation starts to significantly impact the device and interconnect electrical parameters, and therefore the performance of circuits. Back-end-of-line (BEOL) design for manufacturability concerns such as lithography variation and misalignment are more pronounced in the advanced technology node. Since SRAM cell always \"tests\" the most advanced technology among all design blocks, SRAM cell yield analysis considering the internal cell interconnect BEOL impact is important and necessary. In this paper, we perform a critical study of the effects of BEOL lithographic variations on SRAM performance and yield analysis. An SRAM simulation model with internal cell interconnect RC parasitics is presented in order to study the BEOL lithographic impact. With our method, the impact of BEOL variations on memory designs are systematically evaluated. First, we study the impact of ideal parasitics assuming no lithographic variations. This is followed by considering worstcase, best-case and nominal lithographic variations. On average, ideal parasitics impact the delay by more than 20-30% and impact the stability yield leading to SRAM minimum operating voltage, Vmin, increase of 100 mV. This implies that the power estimation with our BEOL model is more accurate, and a traditional model without interconnect parasitic may be 33% off in terms of accuracy. Additional accounting of the litho variations for BEOL study induces about 4% variation on the SRAM read delay. Finally, when the resistance change due to misalignment is of the same order of magnitude as the nonlinear device resistance, the impact is more severe.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810363","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804412/4810250/04810363.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of BEOL lithography effects on the SRAM cell performance and yield","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"The impact of BEOL lithography effects on the SRAM cell performance and yield","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810363/","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559851","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810363/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of BEOL lithography effects on the SRAM cell performance and yield","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4C.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051619S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804412","isNumber":"4810250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804412","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4810250","articleId":"4810363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4810365,"authors":[{"name":"Soner Yaldiz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soner","lastName":"Yaldiz","id":"37565301000"},{"name":"Umut Arslan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Umut","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37428034400"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"},{"name":"Larry Pileggi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Pileggi","id":"37273687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2952-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2953-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4810365","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient statistical analysis of read timing failures in SRAM circuits","abstract":"A system-level statistical analysis methodology is described that captures the impact of inter- and intra-die process variations for read timing failures in SRAM circuit blocks.

Buffer insertion, as a traditional approach to reduce wire delay in 2D ICs, is still necessary in 3D ICs to further optimize interconnects. Since those cross multi-layer nets in 3D ICs need to go through vertical interlayer via, the traditional buffer planning turns into simultaneous buffer and interlayer via planning in 3D ICs. In this paper, we give an efficient buffer and interlayer via planning algorithm with linear complexity, which make sure buffer and interlayer via are inserted as successfully as possible.

Various system level techniques have been proposed to reduce this leakage-power by reducing (scaling) the supply voltage. SRAM supply voltage scaling reduces the leakage-power, but it increases stored-data failure rate due to commonly known failure mechanisms, for example, soft-errors. This work studies SRAM leakage-power reduction using system level design techniques, with a data-reliability constraint. A statistical or probabilistic setup is used to model failure mechanisms like soft-errors or process-variations, and error-probability is used as a metric for reliability. Error models which combine various SRAM cell failure mechanisms are developed. In a probabilistic setup, the bit-error probability increases due to supply voltage reduction, but it can be compensated by suitable choices of error-correction code and data-refresh (scrubbing) rate. The trade-offs between leakage-power, supply voltage reduction, data-refresh rate, error-correction code, and decoding error probability are studied. The leakage-power - including redundancy overhead, coding power, and data-refresh power - is set as the cost-function and an error-probability target is set as the constraint. The cost-function is minimized subject to the constraint, over the choices of data-refresh rate, error-correction code, and supply voltage. Using this optimization procedure, simulation results and circuit-level leakage-power reduction estimates are presented.","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Quality Electronic

A novel approach for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging is presented for both target translational motion and rotational motion nonuniformity compensation. The basic idea is to perform frequency tracking to every individual scatterer via a polynomial fitting technique. After maximizing the projection of one-dimension range alignment to polynomial function in range plane, the Doppler frequency drift of the strongest scatterer in the range cell is automatically tracked out and the multiple prominent point processing scheme is implemented to eliminate both the translational motion error and rotational motion nonuniformity. Further the orientation velocity can be estimated. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805632/4810407/04810440.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","doi":"10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation of ISAR imaging for high-speed moving target","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Radar scattering","Radar tracking","Polynomials","Radar imaging","Frequency","Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Target tracking","Analytical models","Electronics packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","polynomials","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","inverse synthetic aperture radar","ISAR imaging","moving target","target translational motion","rotational motion nonuniformity compensation","frequency tracking","polynomial fitting","1D range alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging","motion compensation","range-doppler (RD) imaging","polynomial fitting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation of ISAR imaging for high-speed moving target","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810440/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560040","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation of ISAR imaging for high-speed moving target","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"KAM-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110895S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4805632","isNumber":"4810407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805632","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4810407","articleId":"4810440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4810453,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wei","affiliation":["Department of Economic Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Li Wei","id":"37087071959"},{"name":"Shang Yumin","affiliation":["Department of Economic Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Shang","lastName":"Yumin","id":"37660298200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3530-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3531-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4810453","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Biological neural networks","Set theory","Data mining","Rough sets","Power generation economics","Energy management","Project management","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flue gas desulphurisation","fuzzy neural nets","power engineering computing","power plants","rough set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["desulfuration projects","fuzzy neural network","rough set theory","decision making","electric power plants desulfuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["desulfuration projects","rough set","fuzzy neural network","knowledge reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810453","abstract":"In the desulfuration projects decisions of the electric power plants, used the fuzzy neural network model based on rough set theory is proposed by integrating rough set with fuzzy neural network.

Optimized pilot matrices have been posted, where pilots in the special sub-carrier were inserted into rectangle pilot matrices. The modified Kalman filter estimation in the special sub-carrier refines estimation in other pilot sub-carriers.

Most existing algorithms require channel coefficients of all receive antennas. It is difficult to satisfy for reduced number of RF chains. Therefore, a new selection algorithm is proposed so that the number of required channel coefficients equals that of RF chains. The presented algorithm uses the remainder antenna to substitute the worse one whose channel coefficient is estimated. Simulation results show that the performance of proposed algorithm is greatly close to that of optimal selection, especially for larger number of RF chains. The proposed algorithm is asymptotic-optimal in performance; moreover, it doesn't need excessive channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810407","startPage":"540","endPage":"543","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805632/4810407/04810544.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Selection and Maximum-Ratio Combining without Excessive Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","Radio frequency","Performance analysis","Rayleigh channels","Antennas and propagation","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-ratio combining","channel estimation","hybrid antenna selection","receive antennas","channel coefficients","RF chains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna selection","maximum-ratio combining","excessive channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Selection and Maximum-Ratio Combining without Excessive Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810544/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810544/","accessionNumber":"10560108","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Selection and Maximum-Ratio Combining without Excessive Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"KAM-00-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051078S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4805632","isNumber":"4810407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805632","xplore-issue":"4810407","articleId":"4810544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810545,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqin Tan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Tan","id":"38188842100"},{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538990200"},{"name":"Zhong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085419611"},{"name":"Liping Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38187145600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3530-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3531-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4810545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"abstract":"We combined the finite rate of innovation (FRI) method with singular value decomposition (SVD) theory and got an improved sampling algorithm of non-band limited signals.

We took streams of diracs signal as an example and deduced the detailed sampling and reconstruction process in the improved algorithm. It first found DFT coefficients of the samples, and constructed a Hankel data matrix. Then the matrix was decomposed according to SVD technique and the position information of diracs was gotten. Finally it computed weight coefficients from the Vandermonde system. The simulation results indicate that the original signal can also be reconstructed well in the presence of noise if only the sample rate is not less than its innovation rate. The sampling method based on SVD has good antinoise performance. It also saves power consumption and computational complexity. In some communication systems such as UWB and CDMA, a very narrow pulse which is like diracs signal very much is used to carry information. So this FRI algorithm based on SVD can be applied in their receivers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Technological innovation","Signal sampling","Matrix decomposition","Singular value decomposition","Filters","Noise reduction","Signal processing","Computational modeling","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non band limited signals","finite rate of innovation method","singular value decomposition theory","improved sampling algorithm","diracs signal","Hankel data matrix","Vandermonde system","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sampling","non-band limited signals","singular value decomposition","finite rate of innovation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810545","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805632/4810407/04810545.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sampling Algorithm of Non-band Limited Signals Based on SVD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling Algorithm of Non-band Limited Signals Based on SVD","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810545/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810545/","accessionNumber":"10560109","conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sampling Algorithm of Non-band Limited Signals Based on SVD","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"KAM-00-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054393S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4805632","isNumber":"4810407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805632","xplore-issue":"4810407","articleId":"4810545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4810546,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Guoliang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Guoliang","id":"37396052100"},{"name":"Zhen Ziyang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Ziyang","id":"37688125200"},{"name":"Li Meng","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Li Meng","id":"37087382479"},{"name":"Wang Daobo","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Daobo","id":"37658741000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3530-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3531-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4810546","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation","Space exploration","Fuzzy control","Technological innovation","Educational institutions","Automation","Animals","Random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning strategy","global robust particle swarm optimization","stagnation phenomenon","diversity scarcity","animal swarms","random sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","swarm intelligence","evolutionary computation","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810546","abstract":"In consideration of stagnation phenomenon in the later phase of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) caused by diversity scarcity of particles, a new learning strategy for improving the global and local exploration capability of particle swarm optimization is proposed in the paper.

In this paper, we propose a method for guiding this parameter reduction to maintain high accuracy with respect to the just noticeable difference for forces. To this end, we performed a user study to estimate this perception threshold. The threshold is used to assess the final error in the rendered forces as well as for the parameter reduction process. Comparison with measured data from real object interactions confirms the accuracy of our method and highlights the reduced computational effort.","doi":"10.1109/WHC.2009.4810814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHC.2009.4810814","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","displayPublicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805587/4810789/04810814.pdf","publicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient techniques for data-driven haptic rendering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient techniques for data-driven haptic rendering","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4810814/","accessionNumber":"10559878","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810814/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient techniques for data-driven haptic rendering","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137028S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4805587","isNumber":"4810789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805587","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4810789","articleId":"4810814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4810835,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37633601600"},{"name":"Angelika Peer","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Angelika","lastName":"Peer","id":"37547817000"},{"name":"Martin Buss","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Buss","id":"37274070400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3858-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4810835","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Haptic interfaces","Admittance","Human robot interaction","Robot sensing systems","Impedance","Force measurement","Filters","Force control","Virtual environment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","haptic interfaces","hidden Markov models","human-robot interaction","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic haptic human-robot interaction","HMM approach","robot controller","human-robot handshaking","position-based admittance controller","hidden Markov model-based high-level controller"]}],"abstract":"A robot controller is developed for human-robot handshaking.

While soft tissue is inherently nonlinear, physics-based simulation of nonlinear tissue behavior with haptic feedback is very challenging as the solution of the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is iterative and therefore extremely computationally intensive. The major contribution of this paper is that through an unprecedented combination of hard and soft computing methods, it is able to reduce the solution of nonlinear problems to almost the same complexity as solving linear problems. This promises to resolve one of the longest-standing technical challenges of real time surgical simulation. The first phase of the method is a pre-computation phase, in which each node of the organ model, with known linear or nonlinear material properties, is provided with carefully chosen prescribed displacements and the response, computed using commercial finite element software tools, is recorded off-line and stored in a large database. The data in then vastly condensed into a set of coefficients describing neurons of a radial basis function (RBF) networks or easier storage and rapid reproduction. During real-time computations, as the surgical tool interacts with the organ models, these neural networks are used to reconstruct the deformation fields as well as the reaction forces at the surgical tool tip. We present simulation results for realistic surgical scenarios with real time force feedback.","doi":"10.1109/WHC.2009.4810896","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805587/4810789/04810896.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","publicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHC.2009.4810896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PhyNeSS: A Physics-driven Neural Networks-based Surgery Simulation system with force feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"PhyNeSS: A Physics-driven Neural Networks-based Surgery Simulation system with force feedback","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10559930","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810896/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PhyNeSS: A Physics-driven Neural Networks-based Surgery Simulation system with force feedback","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"0205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045465S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4805587","isNumber":"4810789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805587","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4810789","articleId":"4810896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4810897,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Berkelman","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Berkelman","id":"37325232200"},{"name":"Michael Dzadovsky","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Dzadovsky","id":"37395439300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3858-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4810897","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Haptic interfaces","Coils","Magnetic devices","Permanent magnets","Planar arrays","Force control","Torque control","Force measurement","Rotation measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","electrical engineering computing","haptic interfaces","magnetic levitation","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic levitation devices","haptic interaction","tool-based haptic interaction","permanent magnet fields","Lorentz levitation haptic devices","Carnegie Mellon University","redundant control methods","motion trajectory"]}],"abstract":"We have developed two different magnetic levitation devices which provide unprecedented ranges of motion in both translation and rotation to a levitated handle to be used for tool-based haptic interaction. The first device levitates a handle attached to a thin spherical shell of flat coils suspended in permanent magnet fields using Lorentz forces. A novel coil type and magnet configuration provides motion ranges of 50 mm and 60 degrees in all directions, double the translation and triple the rotation ranges of the current maximum range Lorentz levitation haptic devices developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The second device uses a planar array of cylindrical coils to levitate a platform of one or more magnets. By using redundant control methods and an experimentally measured high resolution model of the forces and torques generated on the levitated magnets from each coil, the translation range of the magnet in horizontal directions and its rotation in all directions and can be extended potentially indefinitely. The present prototype uses 10 coils to levitate a single magnet over a 80times60 mm planar range, a 30 mm vertical range, and a tilt range of 40 degrees, or to control the yaw rotation of a pair of magnets over 360 degrees. Design and control methods are presented with preliminary motion trajectory results from both devices.","doi":"10.1109/WHC.2009.4810897","publicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4805587/4810789/04810897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHC.2009.4810897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810789","startPage":"517","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the motion ranges of magnetic levitation for haptic interaction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4810897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extending the motion ranges of magnetic levitation for haptic interaction","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4810897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10559931","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4810897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the motion ranges of magnetic levitation for haptic interaction","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"0206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083504S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4805587","isNumber":"4810789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4805587","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4810789","articleId":"4810897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4811104,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew D.

An original optical configuration for target-in-the-loop single-mode fiber amplifier coherent combining through turbulence is presented, with a lambda/15 residual phase error. The experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that detection subsystem aperture reduction is paramount to lower sensitivity to backward turbulence when using a detector in the laser emitter plane. In this configuration, coherent combining is achieved on a remote scattering surface with sole compensation of the onward turbulence. We also present a numerical model capable of assessing the combining efficiency in the case of high-power multimode large-mode-area (LMA) fiber amplifiers. Preliminary theoretical investigations point out that multiple-transverse-mode combining can result in severe wavefront distortion. In the case of multimode LMA fibers, control of the transverse modes phase relationship has to be achieved to preserve combining efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2011141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/4811094/04811119.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"268","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2011141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Shaping of Single-Mode and Multimode Fiber Amplifier Arrays for Propagation Through Atmospheric Turbulence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2009","displayDocTitle":"Beam Shaping of Single-Mode and Multimode Fiber Amplifier Arrays for Propagation Through Atmospheric Turbulence","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4811119/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-april 2009","accessionNumber":"10558207","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Shaping of Single-Mode and Multimode Fiber Amplifier Arrays for Propagation Through Atmospheric Turbulence","sourcePdf":"jstqe-jolivet-2011141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094976S","chronDate":"March-april  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4811094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4811094","articleId":"4811119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4811133,"authors":[{"name":"Cesare Alippi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5289/4811123/4811133/4811133-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cesare Alippi (Alippi@elet.polimi.it) (SM'94-F'06) received a Dr. Ing. degree in electronic engineering (summa cum laude) in 1990 and a Ph.D. degree in computer engineering in 1995, both from the Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy.

When this assumption does not hold, effective energy management strategies should include policies for an efficient use of energy-hungry sensors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIM.2009.4811133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811123","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289/4811123/04811133.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy management in wireless sensor networks with energy-hungry sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4811133/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy management in wireless sensor networks with energy-hungry sensors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560662","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy management in wireless sensor networks with energy-hungry sensors","sourcePdf":"16-23-iamm-12-02-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058894S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289","isNumber":"4811123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5289","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4811123","articleId":"4811133","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4811210,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Alirezaei","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Alirezaei","id":"38095647800"},{"name":"Akihiko Nagakubo","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiko","lastName":"Nagakubo","id":"37295667600"},{"name":"Yasuo Kuniyoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Kuniyoshi","id":"37299294900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3965-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4811210","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":784},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tactile sensors","Electrical resistance measurement","Contact resistance","Tomography","Area measurement","Conductivity measurement","Impedance measurement","Electric variables measurement","Electric resistance","Conducting materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","electric impedance measurement","interactive systems","robots","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile distribution sensor","electrical impedance tomography","noninvasive technique","conductive stretchable sheet","pressure distribution sensors","interactive robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["I.2.9 [Artificial Intelligence]: Robotics\u2014Sensors","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces\u2014Haptic I/O"]}],"abstract":"Recently, we have been studying various tactile distribution sensors based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which is a non-invasive technique to measure the resistance distribution of a conductive material only from a boundary, and needs no wiring inside the sensing area. In this paper, we present a newly developed conductive structure which is pressure sensitive but stretch insensitive and is based on the concept of contact resistance between (1)a network of stretchable wave-like conductive yarns with high resistance and (2)a conductive stretchable sheet with low resistance. Based on this newly developed structure, we have realized a novel tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under dynamic and large stretch from various directions. Stable measurement of pressure distribution under dynamic and complex deformation cases such as pinching and pushing on a balloon surface are demonstrated. The sensor has been originally designed for implementation over interactive robots with soft and highly deformable bodies, but can also be used as novel user interface devices, or ordinary pressure distribution sensors. Some of the most remarkable specifications of the developed tactile sensor are high stretchability up to 140% and toughness under adverse load conditions. The sensor also has a realistic potential of becoming as thin and stretchable as stocking fabric. A goal of this research is to combine this thin sensor with stretch distribution sensors so that richer and more sophisticated tactile interactions can be realized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under high and dynamic stretch","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces","doi":"10.1109/3DUI.2009.4811210","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces","pdfPath":"/iel5/4806855/4811187/04811210.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DUI.2009.4811210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under high and dynamic stretch","conferenceDate":"14-15 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811210/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10560614","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under high and dynamic stretch","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"087_093_alirezae.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088216S","chronDate":"14-15 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4806855","isNumber":"4811187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4806855","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4811187","articleId":"4811210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811242,"authors":[{"name":"Chee-Wooi Ten","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Chee-Wooi","lastName":"Ten","id":"37590021400"},{"name":"Chen-Ching Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Chen-Ching","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280620100"},{"name":"Manimaran Govindarasu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Manimaran","lastName":"Govindarasu","id":"37396722400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811242","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","SCADA systems","Data mining","Computer security","Communication system control","Power systems","Centralized control","Personal communication networks","Programmable control","Distributed control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power engineering computing","security of data","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly extraction","anomaly correlations","power infrastructure cyber systems","geographically dispersed cyber systems","cyber-based control systems","malicious detection","substation networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agent-based methodology","anomaly inference framework","cyber-physical system (CPS)","intelligent attacks"]}],"abstract":"There has not been an organized way to efficiently correlate anomaly behaviors in critical infrastructures as information about malicious activities are not gathered from geographically dispersed cyber systems.

The proposed algorithm is motivated by the observation that some of the genes common to all the individuals during the evolution process can be considered as part of the final solutions and thus can be removed to eliminate the redundant computations at the later generations of the evolution process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we use it to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The benchmarks for the TSP problem range in size from 574 up to 2,152 cities. For the three problems evaluated, our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computation time from 28% up to about 84% compared to that of traditional GA and GA-based algorithms alone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811277/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10570800","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811277/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast genetic algorithm based on pattern reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast genetic algorithm based on pattern reduction","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-037-P0854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.273361S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4811313,"authors":[{"name":"Vasily G.

It presents the novel idea of integrating both grip and move behaviors within one simple compliant actuator mechanism. The manipulator employs two identical path generating compliant mechanisms with two degrees-of-freedom each so that it can grip a workpiece and move it to anywhere within its working area. They are difficult to design because their motions have to be analyzed by finite element methods and the relationship between their geometry and their elastic behavior is highly complex and non-linear. The synthesis of such a mechanism in this work is achieved by a structural optimization approach based on a hybrid genetic algorithm and a morphological representation scheme for defining the structural geometry upon a finite element grid. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates a simple local search strategy with a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. A novel constrained tournament selection is used as a single objective function in the local search strategy. The selection is utilized to determine whether a new solution generated in local search process will survive. Hooke and Jeeves method is applied to decide search path. Good initial solutions, the solutions to be mutated, are chosen for local search.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811336","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811336.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid GA multiobjective optimization for the design of compliant micro-actuators","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560300","htmlLink":"/document/4811336/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid GA multiobjective optimization for the design of compliant micro-actuators","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-096-P1134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121581S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811337,"authors":[{"name":"Nianfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Civil and Environment Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nianfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37692348900"},{"name":"Yaowen Yang","affiliation":["School of Civil and Environment Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yaowen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37578844000"},{"name":"Kang Tai","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Tai","id":"37684422900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811337","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Uncertainty","Biological cells","Evolutionary computation","Data analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Fuzzy sets","Data engineering","Drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","structure design","local search strategy","constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","worst-case-scenario technique","antioptimization","structural optimization","nested optimization problem","objective functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anti-optimization","genetic algorithm","uncertainty","local search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811337","abstract":"This paper describes a technique for design under uncertainty based on hybrid genetic algorithm. In this work, the proposed hybrid algorithm integrates a simple local search strategy with a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The local search is integrated as the worst-case-scenario technique of anti-optimization. When anti-optimization is integrated with structural optimization, a nested optimization problem is created, which can be very expensive to solve. The paper demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization (general genetic algorithm) and anti-optimization (local search) which alleviates the computational burden. The method is applied to the optimization of a simply supported structure under load uncertainties, to the optimization of a simple problem with conflicting objective functions.

Haptic support allows drivers to remain in the direct manual control loop, avoiding known human factors issues with automation. This paper proposes haptic guidance based on the concept of shared control, where both the driver and the support system influence the steering wheel torque. The haptic guidance is developed to continuously generate relatively low forces on the steering wheel, requiring the driver's active steering input to safely negotiate curves. An experiment in a fixed-base driving simulator was conducted, in which 12 young, experienced drivers steered a vehicle - with and without haptic guidance - at a fixed speed along a road with varying curvature. The haptic guidance allowed drivers to slightly but significantly improve safety boundaries in their curve negotiation behavior. Their steering activity was reduced and smoother.

This paper regards the mathematical model of Car-Like Mobil Robot as the vehicle dynamics behavior to develop the controller for VNS. VNS controls the vehicle via two actual control values, one is the degree variation of the front wheel and the other is the acceleration variation of the vehicle versus time respectively. The proposed algorithm is to find the best feedback gain values of the controller for VNS after two analysis process. First, input-output linearization is applied to transform non-linear dynamic model of vehicle to a linear system through states transformation. Contained within the linear system is a set of pseudo control variables; there is a transformation relationship through the decoupling matrix between the vehicle's actual control variable and the pseudo control variable. Second, a pseudo control is generated by designing a state feedback controller of the linear system. Then the best feedback gain values are determined by particle swarm optimizer (PSO). At once the best feedback gains are found by the PSO, pseudo control could be transformed to the actual control applied to the vehicle through a decoupling matrix. In the paper, the controller for VNS constructs a precise and optimized vehicle's automatic navigation strategy and meets the requirement of system closed-loop stability. This paper uses Matlab as the simulation environment, the simulation results show that the proposed method makes vehicle steering in the crooked change road conditions. The proposed algorithm can adjust the vehicle's trajectory to the road trend and can provide a stable driving strategy for driver.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811396","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811396.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"914","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimizer based controller design for Vehicle Navigation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimizer based controller design for Vehicle Navigation System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10570850","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811396/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimizer based controller design for Vehicle Navigation System","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-156-P1015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052802S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4811397,"authors":[{"name":"Chiu-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Inst. of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chiu-Hung Chen","id":"37087169396"},{"name":"Tung-Kuan Liu","affiliation":["Inst. of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-Kuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280957900"},{"name":"Jyh-Horng Chou","affiliation":["Inst. of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Horng","lastName":"Chou","id":"37274488800"},{"name":"Jinn-Tsong Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Ping Tung University of Education, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jinn-Tsong","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37276849000"},{"name":"Wen-Hsien Ho","affiliation":["Department of Medi.

The primary concept of sliding double window filtering is to process the noisy signals with nonoverlapped windows, while the primary concept of fusion sliding window filtering is to process the noisy signals with various weighted filtering methods and overlapped signal values. The results and analysis show the noise reduction of the given noisy gray level images. The proposed methods are compared with the well-known Wiener filtering using images that contain Gaussian noise with the range of variance between 0 and 0.3.

In such conditions, the sensor's output may be erroneous and the system being controlled may malfunction. The need of intelligent sensors arise in such situations. These sensors should be capable of compensating for the adverse effects of the environmental conditions on the sensor output and linearization of sensor response, in order to provide correct readout. In this paper, we propose a novel computationally efficient Legendre functional-link artificial neural network (L-FLANN) to develop a smart sensor that can compensate for the adverse effects of the environmental conditions. By taking two types of environmental models and a pressure sensor, we have shown with extensive computer simulations that the proposed smart sensor is computationally efficient with respect to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based sensor model and capable of satisfactory linearization of sensor output. This smart sensor produces only plusmn0.5% full-scale error between the actual and estimated output for the two selected environmental models under a temperature variation of -50 to 200degC.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811435","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1145","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811435.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of intelligent sensors using Legendre functional-link artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent sensors","Artificial neural networks","Temperature sensors","Control systems","Sensor systems and applications","Humidity control","Temperature control","Condition monitoring","Computer networks","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","intelligent sensors","large-scale systems","linearisation techniques","multilayer perceptrons","neurocontrollers","pressure sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent sensors","Legendre functional-link artificial neural networks","complex systems","environmental parameters","adverse effects","environmental conditions","sensor response","smart sensor","pressure sensor","multilayer perceptron","satisfactory linearization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Legendre functional-link neural networks","smart sensor","nonlinear compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Development of intelligent sensors using Legendre functional-link artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10570863","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of intelligent sensors using Legendre functional-link artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-195-P0553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081386S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811448,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Nejati","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Nejati","id":"37861985500"},{"name":"Zohreh Azimifar","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Azimifar","id":"37325226400"},{"name":"Mohsen Zamani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Zamani","id":"38232476100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811448","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Agriculture","Robotics and automation","Crops","Graphical user interfaces","Costs","Agricultural products","Automatic control","Digital cameras","Spraying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","fast Fourier transforms","image classification","robot vision","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","weed detection","corn fields","agricultural products","robotic cultivators","digital camera","herbicide","cutting","electric shock devices","leaf edge density","crop classification","weed leaves classification"]}],"abstract":"Agriculture plays one of the most important roles in economy and therefore lowering costs and improving quality of agricultural products is highly demanded. Controlling weeds is one of the most important and also expensive labors in agriculture which can be automated using robotic cultivators. These robots should be armed with a digital camera which uses a method to classify between weeds and crops based on captured image and then remove the weed by spraying herbicide accurately on the weed, cutting with blades or damaging with electric shock devices. Any of these methods reduce herbicide usage which also protects environment from side-effects of these chemical substances. In this article a method is proposed which utilizes fast Fourier transform and leaf edge density to classify between crop and weed leaves in corn fields in real-time. This method is based on specific shapes of these leaves and leaf vein structures. Testing the method on a sample set of corn field images showed more than 92% accuracy in detecting weed plants. The resulting application is finally compiled to a dynamic linked library (dll) and used in a graphical user interface (GUI) to be used further by a cultivator robot in a real field.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811448","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811448.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using fast fourier transform for weed detection in corn fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using fast fourier transform for weed detection in corn fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811448/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10570870","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4811448/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using fast fourier transform for weed detection in corn fields","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-208-P0290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060016S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811480,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Murata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Murata","id":"38187598000"},{"name":"Makoto Koshino","affiliation":["Electronics and Information Engineering, Ishikawa national College of Technology, INCT, Kahoku, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Koshino","id":"38192104500"},{"name":"Masatomo Mitamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatomo","lastName":"Mitamura","id":"38188643900"},{"name":"Haruhiko Kimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhiko","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37596120700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811480","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811480","abstract":"In this study, we proposed the method of inference of genetic networks which expresses the regulation of genes.

Due to the inherent characteristics of genetic operators, traditional genetic algorithm (GA) has weaknesses in exploiting a peak. Hence it is time-consuming to attain a high precision solution. To deal with this problem, the geometric center design (GCD) method is proposed. It utilizes the geometric knowledge to approach the geometric center (GC) in search of potential optimum values. In every generation, some high-quality individuals are chosen to compute the GC, which is then evaluated and conditionally put back into the population. Experiments have been implemented on twelve functions for comparison between the traditional GA and the proposed algorithm. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm can remarkably enhance the performance of the traditional GA with faster speed and higher accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811489","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1453","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811489.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel geometric center design method for genetic algorithm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Ant colony optimization","Computer science","Sun","Search methods","Acceleration","Probes","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry center design","genetic algorithm optimization","time-consuming","GCEGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithms (GAs)","local search","geometric center"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel geometric center design method for genetic algorithm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811489/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10570885","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel geometric center design method for genetic algorithm optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-249-P1117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072865S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4811505,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Modler","affiliation":["Department of Media Art, University of Media, Arts and Design, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Modler","id":"37371797500"},{"name":"Tony Myatt","affiliation":["Music Department, University of York, Yorkshire, UK"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Myatt","id":"38190356300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811505","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811505","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Image recognition","Neural networks","Music","Cameras","Image sequences","Humans","Computer interfaces","Hardware","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Fourier transforms","gesture recognition","image motion analysis","image sequences","neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separate hand gestures recognition","time-delay neural networks","multistate spectral image patterns","cyclic hand movements","video-based analysis","human motion","image digitisation","features extraction","image sequences","video camera","supervised training","spatial Fourier transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gesture recognition","Time-delay neural network","spatial Fourier transformation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811505","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811505.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of separate hand gestures by Time-Delay Neural Networks based on multi-state spectral image patterns from cyclic hand movements","abstract":"In recent years video-basedanalysis of human motion has gained increased interest, which for a large part is due to the ongoing rapid developments of computer and camera hardware, such as increased CPU power, fast and modular interfaces and high-quality image digitisation. A similar important role is played by the development of powerful approaches for the analysis of visual data from video sources. In computer music this development is reflected in a row of applications approaching the analysis of video and image data for gestural control of music and sound, such as Eyesweb, Jitter, openCV, Gem, [1], [2], [3], [4]. In this paper an approach is presented for the control of music and sound parameters through hand gestures, which are recognised through a Time-delay Neural Network (TDNN). The recognition networks were trained with appearance-based features extracted from image sequences of a video camera. Cyclic hand gestures are proposed to enable fast and seamless recording and annotation of time series as multi-state patterns. For the supervised training of the TDNNs feature maps based on spatial Fourier transformation of image sequences are proposed. The integration of the gesture recognition in an interactive music piece will be described at the end of the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811505/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10560398","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811505/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recognition of separate hand gestures by Time-Delay Neural Networks based on multi-state spectral image patterns from cyclic hand movements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of separate hand gestures by Time-Delay Neural Networks based on multi-state spectral image patterns from cyclic hand movements","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-265-P1125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060501S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811532,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Chour Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyh-Chour Huang","id":"37087186136"},{"name":"Wei-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wei-Liang Chen","id":"37087569310"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811532","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grippers","Topology","Actuators","Design optimization","Microactuators","Micromechanical devices","Optical sensors","Optical devices","Assembly","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grippers","microactuators","micromanipulators","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topologically optimal microgripper","topological-optimization method","ground structure parameterization","electro-thermal microactuator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["topological-optimization","compliant mechanism","microgripper"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of topologically optimal microgripper","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811532","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811532","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1698","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","abstract":"This paper presents a topological-optimization method which applies the theory of ground structure parameterization to design and analyzes a microgripper device.

A performance comparison was carried out with extensive computer simulations between different ANN-based equalizers, such as, radial basis function (RBF), Chebyshev neural network (ChNN) and the proposed L-FLANN along with a linear least mean square (LMS) finite impulse response (FIR) adaptive filter-based equalizer. The performance indicators include the mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), and computational complexities of the different architectures as well as the eye patterns of the various equalizers. It is shown that the L-FLANN exhibited excellent results in terms of the MSE, BER and the computational complexity of the networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811554/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811554/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10570915","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Legendre-FLANN-based nonlinear channel equalization in wireless communication system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Legendre-FLANN-based nonlinear channel equalization in wireless communication system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-314-P0933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066813S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4811555,"authors":[{"name":"Jeen-Shing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeen-Shing Wang","id":"37087193548"},{"name":"Yi-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Chung Chen","id":"37087769400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811555","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","System identification","Function approximation","Nonlinear systems","Computer simulation","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Nonlinear equations","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","nonlinear dynamical systems","recurrent neural nets","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hammerstein-Wiener recurrent neural network","universal approximation capability","parameter learning","unknown dynamic nonlinear systems","Hammerstein-Wiener model","static nonlinear subsystems","nonlinear transformation","linear state-space equation","linear theory","Stone-Weierstrass theorem","computer simulation","embedded dynamic linear subsystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hammerstein-Wiener model","recurrent neural networks","universal approximation capability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811555","abstract":"This paper presents a Hammerstein-Wiener recurrent neural network with a parameter learning algorithm for identifying unknown dynamic nonlinear systems.

The monitoring process is a two-stage implementation of a classification method. The first stage detects whether the bushing is faulty or normal while the second stage classifies the fault. Experimentation is conducted using dissolve gas-in-oil analysis (DGA) data collected from bushings based on IEEEc57.104; IEC60599 and IEEE production rates methods for oil-impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. It is observed from experimentation that there is no major classification discrepancy between ENN and GMM for the detection stage with classification rates at 87.93% and 87.94% respectively, outperforming HMM which achieved 85.6%. Moreover, HMM fault diagnosis surpasses those of ENN and GMM with a classification of 100%. However, for diagnosis stage HMM outperforms both ENN and GMM with 100% classification rate. ENN and GMM have considerably faster training and classification time whilst HMM's training is time-consuming for both detection and diagnosis stages.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811576","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811576.pdf","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1959","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition monitoring of oil-impregnated paper bushings using Extension Neural Network, Gaussian Mixture and Hidden Markov Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Condition monitoring of oil-impregnated paper bushings using Extension Neural Network, Gaussian Mixture and Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560440","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811576/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition monitoring of oil-impregnated paper bushings using Extension Neural Network, Gaussian Mixture and Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-336-P0273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06333S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4811644,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Jong","lastName":"Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Zhi-Wei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538729600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811644","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Feedback","Actuators","Sensorless control","Robot sensing systems","Fuzzy control","Proportional control","Control systems","Velocity control","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","DC motors","feedback","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","Lyapunov methods","manipulators","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","PD control","position control","robust control","servomotors","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-neural-network tracking control","position feedback","robot manipulator","actuator dynamics","fuzzy-neural-network velocity sensorless control","nonlinear observer","n-link robot manipulator","adaptive tuning laws","Lyapunov stability theorem","numerical simulations","dc servomotors","proportional-differential control","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type control","robust-neural-fuzzy-network control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811644","abstract":"This study focuses on the development of a fuzzy-neural-network velocity sensorless control (FNNVSC) scheme including a nonlinear observer and a fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) controller for an n-link robot manipulator to achieve high-precision position tracking.

In this paper, a novel combing strategy that employs sub-block partition scheme and phase factors for PTS in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed. We present an OFDM system, which through the use of sub-optimal PTS based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, achieves low computation complexity to find optimum phase weighting factors and reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Furthermore, to work around potentially computational intractability, the proposed scheme exploits heuristics in consideration of both global and local exploration partial transmit sequence. Simulation results show that the proposed PSO-based PTS can efficiently find the optimum phase weighting factor, and can achieve the lower PAPR with moderate complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of particle swarm optimization techniques on papr reduction for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811652","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811652.pdf","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance of particle swarm optimization techniques on papr reduction for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811652/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560483","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of particle swarm optimization techniques on papr reduction for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-412-P0889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06166S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811678,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Carpentier","affiliation":["Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Carpentier","id":"38192032700"},{"name":"Mehrbod Sharifi","affiliation":["Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrbod","lastName":"Sharifi","id":"37602883900"},{"name":"Eugene Fink","affiliation":["Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Fink","id":"37276318400"},{"name":"Jaime G.

In this pilot study, we hypothesized that the static balance with single limb support and gait performance during treadmill walking could be improved by providing proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation using subsensory stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback in amputee, respectively. To test this hypothesis, five unilateral transtibial amputees who consecutively wore prosthetics over two years were recruited. Experimental results show a reduction in all of the postural sway indexes and increase in single-leg support time index during single-leg quiet standing by applying subsensory stimulation. With visual-auditory biofeedback for providing clue for heel contact and toe push-off condition during treadmill ambulation, an improvement in all four dynamic gait performance indexes in amputees was verified.

These numerical experiments show that AFPSO has generality and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811693","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811693.pdf","startPage":"2634","endPage":"2639","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization: Dynamic parameter adjustment using swarm activity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization: Dynamic parameter adjustment using swarm activity","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10570971","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811693/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization: Dynamic parameter adjustment using swarm activity","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-453-P0247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120613S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4811696,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Ying Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Ying","lastName":"Sun","id":"37307916800"},{"name":"Chan-Cheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chan-Cheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310981500"},{"name":"Tsung-Ying Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsung-Ying Tsai","id":"37087425282"},{"name":"Jyun-Hong Jheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyun-Hong Jheng","id":"37087424485"},{"name":"Sheng-Ta Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Oriental Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Ta","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37305668300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811696","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Noise reduction","Wavelet domain","Additive noise","Space technology","Wavelet transforms","Signal processing","Filters","Wavelet coefficients","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold exploration","particle swarm optimizer","profitable wavelet decomposition","noise reduction","wavelet representation","signal-dependence","additive noise","de-noisy problem","blind source separation","wavelet threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","noise reduction","best decomposition scale","wavelet threshold determination"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811696","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811696.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2652","endPage":"2657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold exploration via particle swarm optimizer at profitable wavelet decomposition for noise reduction","abstract":"Recently, the research which based on wavelet representation to reduce noise has gotten a lot of attention. The most typical method, universal threshold proposed by Donoho, and its derivative methods have verified their efficiency on varied applications. Some settings which are signal-dependence are critical; however, they were usually given by trial and error or a rough estimate in existing algorithms. This paper addresses the assumption that source signals and additive noise are mutually independent to deal with de-noisy problem without extra prior knowledge. First, the objective function developed from a technique of blind source separation (BSS) is applied on particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to guide the determination of wavelet threshold. Second, the evaluation which is able to determine the most profitable decomposition scale for de-noisy is proposed. Therefore, the best performance of de-noisy could be obtained. In order to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, several simulations which include four benchmarks with different noise degree are designed. The performance of proposed algorithm further compared with that of other existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811696/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10560512","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811696/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Threshold exploration via particle swarm optimizer at profitable wavelet decomposition for noise reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold exploration via particle swarm optimizer at profitable wavelet decomposition for noise reduction","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-456-P1017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085129S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4811726,"authors":[{"name":"Gwo-Ruey Yu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gwo-Ruey","lastName":"Yu","id":"37399256300"},{"name":"Lun-Wei Haung","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lun-Wei","lastName":"Haung","id":"38186003100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811726","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Nanopositioning","Linear matrix inequalities","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy control","Hysteresis","Piezoelectric actuators","Takagi-Sugeno model","Nonlinear equations","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","linear matrix inequalities","nanopositioning","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","piezoelectric actuators","stability","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal fuzzy control","nanopositioning system","linear matrix inequality","hierarchical genetic algorithm","piezoelectric actuator","Bouc-Wen model","nonlinear hysteresis curve","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model","parallel distributed compensation","state feedback gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nano-positioning system","linear matrix inequality","hierarchical genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811726","abstract":"This paper presents optimal fuzzy control of a nano-positioning system by linear matrix inequality (LMI) and hierarchical genetic algorithms (HGAs).

As Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have established themselves as a useful optimization technique in the manufacturing field, the application of GAs to ALB problem has expanded a lot. This paper describes a generalized Pareto-based scale-independent fitness function (gp-siffGA) for solving ALB problem with worker allocation (ALB-wa) to minimize the cycle time, the variation of workload and the total cost under the constraint of precedence relationships at the same time. For this approach, first a random key-based representation method adapting the GA was proposed. Following, advanced genetic operators adapted to the specific chromosome structure and the characteristics of the ALB-wa problem were used. Moreover, Pareto dominance relationship was used to solve the ALB-wa problem without using relative preferences of multiple objectives. Finally, the performance of proposed method was validated through numerical experiments. The results indicated that the proposed approach improved the quality of solutions more than the other existing GA approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811759/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10571002","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811759/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multiobjective genetic algorithm for Assembly Line Balancing problem with worker allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiobjective genetic algorithm for Assembly Line Balancing problem with worker allocation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-519-P0640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057512S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4811806,"authors":[{"name":"Dhadesugoor R.

Using the cluster managed SMANET where, heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities and nodes from different organizations deployed within the same geographical area will support variety of multi-service mission critical applications while increasing the network lifetime. In this network, nodes from different organizations collaborate with each other for mission critical data to be delivered using multi-hop radio-sensor-radio type path routing while keeping the tactical operations supported by the battlefield command control structure transparent. While keeping the collaborative encounters, it is important to keep cross-organization data transfer at the lowest possible level for minimal disruption of the traffic within each organization and for security reasons. Assuming that all nodes are equipped with cognitive radio capability maintaining interoperability, we propose a novel routing metric that maximize the benefits from the collaboration of heterogeneous nodes and take the organizational constraints into account. Furthermore, we propose joint design of cognitive radio and multi-carrier modulation to maximize the bandwidth utilization and energy efficiency in SMANET. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provide much needed survivability and efficiency in battlefield environment while keeping the cross-organization data transfer at the lowest possible level as a value added enhancement compared to homogeneous MANET or sensor networks. Same network design can also find use in civilian environment for supporting applications such as emergency preparedness management and traffic efficiency in congested transportation systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","startPage":"3304","endPage":"3310","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811806.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio mixed sensor and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (SMANET) for dual use applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811806/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio mixed sensor and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (SMANET) for dual use applications","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571022","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio mixed sensor and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (SMANET) for dual use applications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-566-P1218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067875S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4811808,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Qu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Qu","id":"37297126200"},{"name":"Laurence B.

Working at the part level, as opposed to the whole object level, enables a more flexible class representation and allows scenes in which the query object is significantly occluded to be classified. Therefore, a parts-based learning approach is proposed in order to better deal with side vehicle variability, illumination conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. Most existing boosting learning algorithms usually select weak classifiers by minimizing a cost directly associated with the error rate, where the learned strong classifier may be sub-optimal for applications in terms of error rate. Nevertheless, the proposed Adaboost approach selects weak classifiers by minimizing multiple types of error functions. The idea is to define multiple types of error functions based on current strong classifier and each selected weak classifier results to represent different effects of each weak classifier. Therefore, weak classifiers can be selected with different requirements at the same time to avoid a sub-optimal solution. To reduce system computation, window-based tracking is employed. Moreover, Kalman filtering is used to predict the position of each part of vehicles in the image plane to effectively relocate the tracking windows. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed system appears to be capable of improving system efficiency and accuracy under varying lighting conditions, changing vehicle poses, and in the presence of partial occlusions. Our approach has been successfully validated in real traffic environments by performing experiments with a CCD camera mounted onboard a highway vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811818","startPage":"3370","endPage":"3375","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811818.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time side vehicle tracking using parts-based boosting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Error analysis","Real time systems","Vehicle detection","Layout","Lighting","Costs","Kalman filters","Filtering","Charge coupled devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","CCD image sensors","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time side vehicle tracking","parts-based boosting","real-time vision-based side vehicle detection system","parts-based learning approach","error functions","weak classifier","window-based tracking","Kalman filtering","CCD camera","highway vehicle","intelligent transportation systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boosting","Intelligent transportation system","Learning algorithm","Part-based detection","Side vehicle detection","Visual tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Real-time side vehicle tracking using parts-based boosting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560575","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time side vehicle tracking using parts-based boosting","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-578-P0400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062657S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4811848,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Celenk","affiliation":["Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Celenk","id":"37294790800"},{"name":"Thomas Conley","affiliation":["Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Conley","id":"37402457600"},{"name":"James Graham","affiliation":["Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Graham","id":"38546432200"},{"name":"John Willis","affiliation":["Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Willis","id":"37408521800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811848","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Adaptive systems","Wiener filter","Predictive models","Network servers","Web server","Noise robustness","Statistics","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","estimation theory","Gaussian distribution","Internet","noise","security of data","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly prediction","network traffic","adaptive Wiener filtering","ARMA modeling","anomalies detection","network maintenance","network security","anomaly detection","noise","traffic signal statistics","network-monitoring metrics","average port","high port","server ports","peered ports","near-real-time Internet traffic","wide-area network","estimation process","Gaussian-like distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network anomalies","network security","Wiener filtering","ARMA modeling","adaptive digital anomaly predictor","majority voting"]}],"abstract":"Fast and efficient detection of anomalies is essential for maintaining a robust and secure network. This research presents a method of anomaly detection based on adaptive Wiener filtering of noise followed by ARMA modeling of network flow data. We dynamically calculate noise and traffic signal statistics using network-monitoring metrics for traffic features such as average port, high port, server ports, and peered ports. The underlying approach is tested on near-real-time Internet traffic in the wide-area network (WAN) of Ohio University. The average port feature is determined to be the most informative measure in the estimation process. High port, server ports, and peered ports are used for confirmation of the anomaly detection result. We empirically determine that most of the network features obey Gaussian-like distributions. Experiments reveal that the method is highly effective in predicting anomalies in network traffic flow and preventing any hazard that they may cause.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly prediction in network traffic using adaptive Wiener filtering and ARMA modeling","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811848","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4803719/4811240/04811848.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly prediction in network traffic using adaptive Wiener filtering and ARMA modeling","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811848/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571043","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly prediction in network traffic using adaptive Wiener filtering and ARMA modeling","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rps-608-P0790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063297S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4803719","isNumber":"4811240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4803719","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4811240","articleId":"4811848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4811851,"authors":[{"name":"Yain-Whar Si","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Yain-Whar","lastName":"Si","id":"37427339400"},{"name":"Yi-Yang Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599956900"},{"name":"Wai-Leong Leong","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Wai-Leong","lastName":"Leong","id":"37699760200"},{"name":"Sio-Meng Leong","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Sio-Meng","lastName":"Leong","id":"38190384600"},{"name":"Chi-Iong Wong","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Iong","lastName":"Wong","id":"38190269100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2383-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4811851","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elevators","Monitoring","Control systems","Circuit testing","Centralized control","Data warehouses","Real time systems","Transportation","Printed circuits","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","data warehouses","genetic algorithms","lifts","maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven elevator testing","elevator control","elevator monitoring","elevator maintenance","transportation systems","urban communities","onboard controllers","board elevator controllers","virtual controller","genetic algorithm","maintenance scheduling","data warehouse"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven elevator testing, control, monitoring, and maintenance","abstract":"Elevators are considered as important transportation systems for urban communities.

The integrated system consists of a virtual controller, control and monitoring terminals, a central server, a playback function with animation, a genetic algorithm based maintenance scheduling module, and a data warehouse for managing massive real-time elevator signals. Based on the event-driven architecture, the proposed system is capable of facilitating faster deployment of new types of elevators.

Our design emphasizes high-efficiency scalability, low-cost commodity components, lightweight software layers, end-to-end parallelism, client-side caching and software parity, and a unique model of load-balancing outgoing I/O onto high-speed intermediate storage followed by asynchronous reconstruction to a 3rd-party parallel file system.","doi":"10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811883","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4809879/4811879/04811883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811879","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zest Checkpoint storage system for large supercomputers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zest Checkpoint storage system for large supercomputers","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811883/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571058","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4811883/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zest Checkpoint storage system for large supercomputers","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"Session1C-nowoczynski-pdsw08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034783S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4809879","isNumber":"4811879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4809879","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4811879","articleId":"4811883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4811886,"authors":[{"name":"Milo Polte","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Milo","lastName":"Polte","id":"38189030100"},{"name":"Jiri Simsa","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Simsa","id":"37667351900"},{"name":"Garth Gibson","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Garth","lastName":"Gibson","id":"37356991200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4208-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-7242"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-7250"}],"articleNumber":"4811886","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":435},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811886","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Sequential analysis","System testing","Magnetic devices","File systems","Computer science","Performance analysis","Particle measurements","Size measurement","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Flash solid state devices","mechanical disks","IOZone benchmark","single-threaded mode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811886","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4809879/4811879/04811886.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing performance of solid state devices and mechanical disks","abstract":"In terms of performance, solid state devices promise to be superior technology to mechanical disks. This study investigates performance of several up-to-date high-end consumer and enterprise Flash solid state devices (SSDs) and relates their performance to that of mechanical disks. For the purpose of this evaluation, the IOZone benchmark is run in single-threaded mode with varying request size and access pattern on an ext3 filesystem mounted on these devices. The price of the measured devices is then used to allow for comparison of price per performance. Measurements presented in this study offer an evaluation of cost-effectiveness of a Flash based SSD storage solution over a range of workloads. In particular, for sequential access pattern the SSDs are up to 10 times faster for reads and up to 5 times faster than the disks. For random reads, the SSDs provide up to 200times performance advantage. For random writes the SSDs provide up to 135times performance advantage. After weighting these numbers against the prices of the tested devices, we can conclude that SSDs are approaching price per performance of magnetic disks for sequential access patterns workloads and are superior technology to magnetic disks for random access patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811886/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571060","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparing performance of solid state devices and mechanical disks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing performance of solid state devices and mechanical disks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"Session2B-simsa-pdsw08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073676S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4809879","isNumber":"4811879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4809879","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4811879","articleId":"4811886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811889,"authors":[{"name":"Grant Mackey","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"Grant","lastName":"Mackey","id":"38111491400"},{"name":"Saba Sehrish","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"Saba","lastName":"Sehrish","id":"37572992600"},{"name":"John Bent","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bent","id":"37341149700"},{"name":"Julio Lopez","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Lopez","id":"38186017300"},{"name":"Salman Habib","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Habib","id":"37347575500"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Carnegie Melon University, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280527200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4208-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-7242"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-7250"}],"articleNumber":"4811889","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":905},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Libraries","Engines","Timing","Time measurement","Benchmark testing","System performance","Laboratories","Utility programs","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomy computing","data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high end computing","Hadoop MapReduce implementation","supercomputing scientific fields","data intensive applications","astrophysics datasets","Hadoop architecture","visualization software","computation resources","astronomy data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811889","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd Petascale Data Storage Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4809879/4811879/04811889.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDSW.2008.4811889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing map-reduce to high end computing","abstract":"In this work we present an scientific application that has been given a Hadoop MapReduce implementation.

We provide an example of how the halo finding application, when applied to large astrophysics datasets, benefits from the model of the Hadoop architecture. The halo finding application uses a friends of friends algorithm to quickly cluster together large sets of particles to output files which a visualization software can interpret. The current implementation requires that large datasets be moved from storage to computation resources for every simulation of astronomy data. Our Hadoop implementation allows for an in-place halo finding application on the datasets, which removes the time consuming process of transferring data between resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4811889/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571061","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Introducing map-reduce to high end computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing map-reduce to high end computing","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"Session3A-mackey-pdsw08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10087S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4809879","isNumber":"4811879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4809879","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4811879","articleId":"4811889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4811933,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Fu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5290268/4811933/4811933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Fu Sun (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and information engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

Time-domain beamforming SAS reconstruction is able to compensate arbitrary track errors, but the more efficient frequency-domain reconstruction algorithms, such as the range-Doppler, chirp-scaling, and wave number (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">aka</i>\n range migration or Stolt-mapping) algorithms do not allow for simple compensation, especially for widebeam sonars. Data processed via these block algorithms is usually compensated before azimuth compression in a computationally inexpensive preprocessing step. Unfortunately, this compensation assumes a narrowbeam geometry, causing blurring in high-resolution images collected with widebeam sonars. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique for compensation of large, but known, motion errors in data collected with widebeam geometry sonars. The technique relies on obtaining angle-of-arrival information from the multiple-receiver array configuration typical in high-resolution SAS systems. The new method of compensating for motion errors was found to significantly outperform the previous techniques in a simulation of point-reflector imagery.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2009.2014659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5191240/04811938.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2009.2014659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-Compensation Improvement for Widebeam, Multiple-Receiver SAS Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811938/","displayDocTitle":"Motion-Compensation Improvement for Widebeam, Multiple-Receiver SAS Systems","volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10805806","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811938/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-Compensation Improvement for Widebeam, Multiple-Receiver SAS Systems","sourcePdf":"joe-hcallow-2014659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069876S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5191240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5191240","articleId":"4811938","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811941,"authors":[{"name":"Dong G.

Simulations of link performance performed with an internal link modeling tool allowed us to explore the effect of equalization and modulation formats at different data rates on link bit error rate and eye opening. Our link models have been validated with active, high-speed differential bus measurements utilizing a 16-channel link chip with programmable equalization and a per-channel data rate of up to 11 Gb/s. Electrical signaling limits were then determined by extrapolating these hardware-correlated models to higher speeds, and these limits were compared to the results of recent work on on-board optical interconnects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10667151","htmlLink":"/document/4811941/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Is 25 Gb/s On-Board Signaling Viable?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is 25 Gb/s On-Board Signaling Viable?","sourcePdf":"tadvp-kam-2011138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11146S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4982886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4982886","articleId":"4811941","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811945,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Balamurugan","affiliation":["Microprocessor Technology Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4982886/4811945/4811945-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ganesh Balamurugan (S'99\u2013M'04) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 2004.","Since 2004, he has been with Intel's Circuit Research Laboratory, Hillsboro, OR.

In this regime, it is critical to accurately model and comprehend channel/circuit nonidealities in order to co-optimize the link architecture, circuits, and interconnect. Empirical and worst-case analysis methods used at lower rates are inadequate to account for several deterministic and random noise sources present in I/O links today. In this paper, we review models and methods for statistical signaling analysis of high-speed links, and also propose a new way to integrate behavioral modeling approaches with analytical methods. A computationally efficient segment-based analysis method is shown to accurately capture the effect of transmit jitter and its interaction with the channel. In addition, a new jitter interpretation approach is proposed to enable the analysis of arbitrary I/O clocking topologies. We also present some examples to illustrate the practical utility of these analysis methods in the realm of high-speed I/O design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811945/","volume":"32","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4811945/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10667161","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of High-Speed I/O Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of High-Speed I/O Links","sourcePdf":"tadvp-balamurugan-2011366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111667S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4982886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4982886","articleId":"4811945","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4811948,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Arnitz","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909499/4811948/4811948-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Arnitz (S'08) received the Master degree Dipl.-Ing.(FH) in electrical engineering from the University of Applied Sciences FH Joanneum Kapfenberg, Styria, Austria, in 2005.

The proposed system concept relies on exact phase information; hence, the passive tag cannot be accurately modeled as a frequency-flat linear device. A linearized model of the tag's reflection coefficient is devised to bridge the gap between the nonlinear reality and the linear CW radar theory. Estimation error bounds are derived and effects caused by noise and multipath propagation are analyzed in detail. It has been found that systematic errors introduced by the tag's reflection characteristic cannot be compensated by using multiple carriers due to large variations caused by detuning. Nonetheless the system, while being vulnerable to multipath propagation effects, still performs well under line-of-sight conditions; mean average errors below 15% of the true distance are possible in typical fading environments..","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909499/04811948.pdf","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multifrequency Continuous-Wave Radar Approach to Ranging in Passive UHF RFID","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive radar","Radiofrequency identification","Passive RFID tags","Acoustic reflection","Radio frequency","Bridges","Radar theory","Estimation error","Cause effect analysis","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","multipath channels","radar theory","radiofrequency identification","UHF devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifrequency continuous-wave radar","passive UHF RFID","frequency-flat linear device","nonlinear reality","linear CW radar theory","multipath propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-wave (CW) radar","detuning","multipath channel","narrowband","ranging","system modeling","ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RF identification (RFID)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multifrequency Continuous-Wave Radar Approach to Ranging in Passive UHF RFID","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4811948/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628425","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifrequency Continuous-Wave Radar Approach to Ranging in Passive UHF RFID","sourcePdf":"tmtt-arnitz-part2-2017320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050466S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4909499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4909499","articleId":"4811948","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811950,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Gyu Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909499/4811950/4811950-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Won-Gyu Lim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

A well-known challenge to local stereo methods is to decide an appropriate support window for the pixel under consideration, adapting the window shape or the pixelwise support weight to the underlying scene structures. Our stereo method tackles this problem with two key contributions. First, for each anchor pixel an upright cross local support skeleton is adaptively constructed, with four varying arm lengths decided on color similarity and connectivity constraints. Second, given the local cross-decision results, we dynamically construct a shape-adaptive full support region on the fly, merging horizontal segments of the crosses in the vertical neighborhood. Approximating image structures accurately, the proposed method is among the best performing local stereo methods according to the benchmark Middlebury stereo evaluation. Additionally, it reduces memory consumption significantly thanks to our compact local cross representation. To accelerate matching cost aggregation performed in an arbitrarily shaped 2-D region, we also propose an orthogonal integral image technique, yielding a speedup factor of 5-15 over the straightforward integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811952/","volume":"19","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4811952/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10794804","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Based Local Stereo Matching Using Orthogonal Integral Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Based Local Stereo Matching Using Orthogonal Integral Images","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-kzhang-2020478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051788S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5175618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"325","xplore-issue":"5175618","articleId":"4811952","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4811954,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Langley","affiliation":["Freeman Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5437399/4811954/4811954-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philip Langley received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Hull, Hull, U.K., in 1991 and 1996, respectively.","In 1998, he joined the Cardiovascular Physics and Engineering Research Group, Medical Physics Department, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., where he is currently a Principal Research Associate and an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Advanced Research Fellow.

The respiratory-induced variability of ECG features, P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves are described by the PCA. We assessed which ECG features and which principal components yielded the best surrogate for the respiratory signal. Twenty subjects performed controlled breathing for 180 s at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 breaths per minute and normal breathing. ECG and breathing signals were recorded. Respiration was derived from the ECG by three algorithms: the PCA-based algorithm and two established algorithms, based on RR intervals and QRS amplitudes. ECG-derived respiration was compared to the recorded breathing signal by magnitude squared coherence and cross-correlation. The top ranking algorithm for both coherence and correlation was the PCA algorithm applied to QRS complexes. Coherence and correlation were significantly larger for this algorithm than the RR algorithm(p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001, respectively) but were not significantly different from the amplitude algorithm. PCA provides a novel algorithm for analysis of both respiratory and nonrespiratory related beat-to-beat changes in different ECG features.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2018297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/04811954.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2018297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","startPage":"821","endPage":"829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal Component Analysis as a Tool for Analyzing Beat-to-Beat Changes in ECG Features: Application to ECG-Derived Respiration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Principal Component Analysis as a Tool for Analyzing Beat-to-Beat Changes in ECG Features: Application to ECG-Derived Respiration","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811954/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206216","pubMedId":"19362906","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4811954/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal Component Analysis as a Tool for Analyzing Beat-to-Beat Changes in ECG Features: Application to ECG-Derived Respiration","sourcePdf":"tbme-langley-2018297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067729S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"4811954","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811962,"authors":[{"name":"Jong I.

Conventional approaches use original performance degradation profiles of remaining capacity after recharge in order to detect faulty batteries. However, original degradation profiles with right-truncated test duration may not be effective in detecting faulty batteries. In this correspondence, we propose dual features functional support vector machine approach that uses both first and second derivatives of degradation profiles for early detection of faulty batteries with the reduced error rate. The modified floating search algorithm for the repeated feature selection with newly added degradation path points is presented to find a few good features for the enhanced detection while reducing the computation time for online implementation. After that, an attribute sampling plan considering time-varying classification errors is presented to determine the optimal number of test cycles and sample sizes by minimizing our proposed cost function. The real-life case study is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and show its improved performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed method can be applied in a wide range of manufacturing processes to assess time-dependent quality characteristics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5068840/04811962.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2014642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2014642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Features Functional Support Vector Machines for Fault Detection of Rechargeable Batteries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Fault detection","Batteries","Degradation","Testing","Error analysis","Sampling methods","Manufacturing processes","Computerized monitoring","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fault diagnosis","manufacturing processes","power engineering computing","secondary cells","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual features functional support vector machines","fault detection","secondary rechargeable battery","right-truncated test duration","modified floating search algorithm","degradation path points","time-varying classification errors","time-dependent quality characteristics","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attribute sampling plans","data mining","feature selection","process monitoring","secondary rechargeable battery","support vector machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dual Features Functional Support Vector Machines for Fault Detection of Rechargeable Batteries","volume":"39","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4811962/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10714110","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Features Functional Support Vector Machines for Fault Detection of Rechargeable Batteries","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-jeong-2014642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085222S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5068840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5068840","articleId":"4811962","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811982,"authors":[{"name":"Vasiliy Sachnev","affiliation":["Center of Information Security and Technology, Graduate School of Information Management and Security, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5175618/4811982/4811982-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vasiliy Sachnev received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Komsomolsk-na-Amure State Technical University, Russia, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

Moreover, it is scalable, which is important for modern video standards. The transpose memory requirement and operation speed are the two major concerns in 2-D lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LDWT) implementation. This letter presents a novel algorithm, called 2-D symmetric mask-based discrete wavelet transform (SMDWT), to improve the critical issue of the 2-D LDWT, and then obtains the benefit of low-latency reduced complexity, and low transpose memory. The SMDWT also has the advantages of reduced complexity, regular signal coding, short critical path, reduced latency time, and independent subband coding processing. Furthermore, the 2-D LDWT performance can also be easily improved by exploiting an appropriate parallel method inherent to SMDWT.

Many fast matching mechanisms have been developed to lower the computational load for block matching, such as those exploiting block feature based or attribute-based SAD calculations. By examining a subblock-sum-based SAD measure, where the subblock-sums can be considered to be intra-subblock features, we propose both intra- and inter-subblock features based SAD measure for more effective block matching in terms of achieving better coding efficiency. Interestingly, the proposed feature based SAD measure can be interpreted as subblock-based sum of absolute Hadamard transformed differences (SATD). The new features can be constructed in a multilevel structure, which may provide a flexible and scalable means for a tradeoff between computation load and coding efficiency. Encoding results are shown to compare the proposed scheme against other relevant feature based SAD measures.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2020260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5175618/04811984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2020260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175618","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Block Matching Motion Estimation Using Multilevel Intra- and Inter-Subblock Features Subblock-Based SATD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Block Matching Motion Estimation Using Multilevel Intra- and Inter-Subblock Features Subblock-Based SATD","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10794797","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4811984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Block Matching Motion Estimation Using Multilevel Intra- and Inter-Subblock Features Subblock-Based SATD","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-czhu-2020260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085079S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5175618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5175618","articleId":"4811984","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811988,"authors":[{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lai-Man","lastName":"Po","id":"37270836200"},{"name":"Ka-Ho Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka-Ho","lastName":"Ng","id":"37291984900"},{"name":"Kwok-Wai Cheung","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, CHU, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwok-Wai","lastName":"Cheung","id":"38181907500"},{"name":"Ka-Man Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka-Man","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278688500"},{"name":"Yusuf Md.

This may lead to low robustness in prediction accuracy particularly for video sequences with complex motions. This problem is especially serious in one-at-a-time search (OTS) and block-based gradient descent search (BBGDS), which provide very high speedup ratio. A multipath search using more than one search path has been proposed to improve the robustness of BBGDS but the computational requirement is much increased. To tackle this drawback, a novel directional gradient descent search (DGDS) algorithm using multiple OTSs and gradient descent searches on the error surface in eight directions is proposed in this letter. The search point patterns in each stage depend on the minima found in these eight directions, and thus the global minimum can be traced more efficiently. In addition, a fast version of the DGDS (FDGDS) algorithm is also described to further improve the speed of DGDS. Experimental results show that DGDS reduces computation load significantly compared with the well-known fast block motion estimation algorithms. Moreover, FDGDS can achieve faster speedup compared with the UMHexagonS algorithm in H.264/AVC implementation while maintaining very similar rate-distortion performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828258","htmlLink":"/document/4811988/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Novel Directional Gradient Descent Searches for Fast Block Motion Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Directional Gradient Descent Searches for Fast Block Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lpo-2020320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073441S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5208486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5208486","articleId":"4811988","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4811990,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Han Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5208486/4811990/4811990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Han Chen was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1981.

It is intended to skip some parts of certain depth map viewpoints without encoding and to just predict those skipped parts by exploiting the multiview correspondences and some flags transmitted. It is targeted to save the bit rate allocated for depth map sequences to a great extent. Multiview correspondences are exploited for each skipped depth map frame by making use of the depth map frames belonging to neighboring views and captured at the same time instant. A prediction depth map frame is constructed block by block on a free viewpoint qualitywise selective basis from a couple of candidate predictors generated through the implicit and explicit usage of the 3-D scene geometry. Especially at lower bit rates, dropping higher temporal layers of certain depth map viewpoints and replacing them with corresponding predictors generated using the proposed multiview aided approach save a great amount of bit rate for those depth map viewpoints. At the same time, the perceived quality of the reconstructed stereoscopic videos is maintained, which is proved through a set of subjective tests.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Bit rate","Image reconstruction","Rendering (computer graphics)","Video coding","Layout","Geometry","Testing","Three dimensional displays","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal subsampling approach","multiview depth map compression","reconstructed stereoscopic videos","video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth map compression","multiview depth map coding","video coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2020336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5208486/04811997.pdf","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2020336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Temporal Subsampling Approach for Multiview Depth Map Compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4811997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Temporal Subsampling Approach for Multiview Depth Map Compression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4811997/","volume":"19","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4811997/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10828261","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Temporal Subsampling Approach for Multiview Depth Map Compression","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-eekmekcioglu-2020336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042819S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5208486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5208486","articleId":"4811997","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4811998,"authors":[{"name":"Satyabrata Sen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Sen","id":"37411627200"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4811998","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","OFDM","Radar clutter","Radar detection","Doppler radar","Frequency diversity","Parametric statistics","Frequency measurement","Doppler shift","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar","Doppler radar","object detection","OFDM modulation","radar clutter","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target detection","clutter environment","adaptive OFDM radar","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic detection performance","generalized likelihood ratio test","optimal waveform design","OFDM radar"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of detecting a target moving in clutter environment using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar.

However, the converted frames often suffer from serious defects like feathering artifacts in regions with inaccurate motion vectors (MVs). In such regions, an intra-field method that is robust to MV errors can be used to correct motion compensation artifacts (MCAs). In this letter, we propose an adaptive arbitration method to combine intra-field and MC methods adequately. The proposed method considers the reliability of MC results along with the MV reliability measured by the spatio-temporal consistency of MVs and displaced pixel differences. The MC reliability is determined by detecting MCAs in MC results, and then the MV reliability is adjusted according to the MC reliability.

Unlike traditional radios, a cognitive radio may change its objectives as radio scenarios vary. Because of the dynamic pairing of objectives and contexts, it is imperative for cognitive radio network designers to have a firm understanding of the interrelationships among goals, performance metrics, utility functions, link/network performance, and operating environments. In this paper, we first overview various performance metrics at the node, network, and application levels. From a game-theoretic viewpoint, we then show that the performance evaluation of cognitive radio networks exhibits the interdependent nature of actions, goals, decisions, observations, and context. We discuss the interrelationships among metrics, utility functions, cognitive engine algorithms, and achieved performance, as well as various testing scenarios. We propose the radio environment map-based scenario-driven testing (REM-SDT) for thorough performance evaluation of cognitive radios. An IEEE 802.22 WRAN cognitive engine testbed is presented to provide further insights into this important problem area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"97","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572758","htmlLink":"/document/4812016/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cognitive Radios: Metrics, Utility Functions, and Methodology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Cognitive Radios: Metrics, Utility Functions, and Methodology","sourcePdf":"jproc-zhao-2013017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136196S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4814763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4814763","articleId":"4812016","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812021,"authors":[{"name":"Alexe E.

Mobile WiMax is an emerging wireless networking standard that could potentially benefit from cognitive radio technology. We develop a framework for applying cognitive radio technology to mobile WiMax networks to increase capacity and simplify network operations. In the proposed cognitive WiMax architecture, base stations are equipped with sensitive detectors and assign channels to subscriber stations dynamically based on spectrum availability. Power control is employed to increase frequency reuse in conjunction with spectrum sensing. Using computer simulation, we evaluate the performance of ldquocognitive channel assignmentrdquo relative to conventional dynamic channel assignment. Our numerical results show that cognitive radios can substantially increase the capacity of emerging WiMax networks by exploiting inherent spectrum hole opportunities. The key performance parameters determining the achievable capacity of cognitive WiMax networks are the detection and interference range, which depend in turn on characteristics of the radio propagation environment.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013044","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4814763/04812021.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Cognitive WiMAX With Frequency Agility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812021","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812021/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Cognitive WiMAX With Frequency Agility","volume":"97","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572750","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812021/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Cognitive WiMAX With Frequency Agility","sourcePdf":"jproc-mark-2013044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131649S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4814763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4814763","articleId":"4812021","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812025,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon L.

This is an effective way to prevent interference, but it leads to highly inefficient use of spectrum. Cognitive radio along with software radio, spectrum sensors, mesh networks, and other emerging technologies can facilitate new forms of spectrum sharing that greatly improve spectral efficiency and alleviate scarcity, if policies are in place that support these forms of sharing. On the other hand, new technology that is inconsistent with spectrum policy will have little impact. This paper discusses policies that can enable or facilitate use of many spectrum-sharing arrangements, where the arrangements are categorized as being based on \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">coexistence</i>\n or \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cooperation</i>\n and as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sharing</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">among</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">equals</i>\n or \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">primary-secondary</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sharing</i>\n. A shared spectrum band may be managed directly by the regulator, or this responsibility may be delegated in large part to a license-holder. The type of sharing arrangement and the entity that manages it have a great impact on which technical approaches are viable and effective. The most efficient and cost-effective form of spectrum sharing will depend on the type of systems involved, where systems under current consideration are as diverse as television broadcasters, cellular carriers, public safety systems, point-to-point links, and personal and local-area networks. In addition, while cognitive radio offers policy-makers the opportunity to improve spectral efficiency, cognitive radio also provides new challenges for policy enforcement. A responsible regulator will not allow a device into the marketplace that might harm other systems. Thus, designers must seek innovative ways to assure regulators that new devices will comply with policy requirements and will not cause harmful interference.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812027/","volume":"97","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812027/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10572755","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sharing Spectrum Through Spectrum Policy Reform and Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharing Spectrum Through Spectrum Policy Reform and Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"jproc-peha-2013033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11506S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4814763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"4814763","articleId":"4812027","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4812028,"authors":[{"name":"Allen B.

We also describe developments that support the cognitive engine and advances in radio technology that provide the flexibility desired in a cognitive radio node. We consider securing and verifying cognitive systems and examine the challenges of expanding the cognitive paradigm up the protocol stack to optimize end-to-end network performance.

Since the range and Doppler information of these scatterers are no longer constant, the conventional range-Doppler-based imaging algorithms are invalid. Meanwhile, 3-D imaging is necessary to obtain additional information for the spinning target. However, the available interferometric inverse synthetic radar (ISAR) and snapshot 3-D imaging algorithms do not work well since they require low target spinning speed. In this paper, a matched-filter-bank-based 3-D imaging algorithm for rapidly spinning targets is proposed, based on target motion features. This algorithm utilizes the rapidly rotating turntable model of the ISAR target instead of the slow rotating one. First, 2-D image slices of the target are obtained from the output of the matched filter bank by changing matching parameters. Then, a series of 2-D image slices are combined to form the 3-D target image. Since this algorithm applies to the monostatic radar system, it is easy to implement in practical applications. Both the theoretical derivation and the simulation results have proved the validity of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075850","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5075850/04812029.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spinning","Radar imaging","Radar scattering","Doppler radar","Radar antennas","Spaceborne radar","Helicopters","Blades","Space debris","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","radar tracking","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched-filter-bank-based 3D imaging algorithm","spinning targets","rotating ground radar antenna","helicopter blades","spinning space debris","target motion features","2D image slices","matching parameters","3D target image","monostatic radar system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","matched filter bank","rapidly spinning targets","3-D imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Matched-Filter-Bank-Based 3-D Imaging Algorithm for Rapidly Spinning Targets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812029/","volume":"47","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4812029/","accessionNumber":"10705111","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Matched-Filter-Bank-Based 3-D Imaging Algorithm for Rapidly Spinning Targets","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xing-2010499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111925S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5075850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5075850","articleId":"4812029","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4812031,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Ge received the B.S. degree in surveying and mapping and the M.S. degree in geographical information system from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in cartography and geographical information system from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2001.","She is an Associate Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Based on predefined heuristics, the classifier ranks the unlabeled pixels and automatically chooses those that are considered the most valuable for its improvement. Once the pixels have been selected, the analyst labels them manually and the process is iterated. Starting with a small and nonoptimal training set, the model itself builds the optimal set of samples which minimizes the classification error. We have applied the proposed algorithms to a variety of remote sensing data, including very high resolution and hyperspectral images, using support vector machines. Experimental results confirm the consistency of the methods. The required number of training samples can be reduced to 10% using the methods proposed, reaching the same level of accuracy as larger data sets. A comparison with a state-of-the-art active learning method, margin sampling, is provided, highlighting advantages of the methods proposed. The effect of spatial resolution and separability of the classes on the quality of the selection of pixels is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5075850/04812037.pdf","startPage":"2218","endPage":"2232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Learning Methods for Remote Sensing Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active Learning Methods for Remote Sensing Image Classification","volume":"47","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812037/","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705124","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812037/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Learning Methods for Remote Sensing Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tuia-2010404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173732S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5075850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"330","xplore-issue":"5075850","articleId":"4812037","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4812039,"authors":[{"name":"Tim S.

Small nonlinearities of airborne platform tracks are corrected for during a motion-compensation step while maintaining the assumption of a linear flight path. This paper describes the processing of SAR data acquired from nonlinear tracks, typical of sensors mounted on small aircraft or drones flying at low altitude. Such aircraft do not fly along straight tracks, but the trajectory depends on topography, influences of weather and wind, or the shape of areas of interest such as rivers or traffic routes. Two potential approaches for processing SAR data from such highly nonlinear flight tracks are proposed, namely, a patchwise frequency-domain processing and mosaicking technique and a time-domain back-projection-based technique. Both are evaluated with the help of experimental data featuring tracks with altitude changes, a double bend, a 90deg curve, and a linear flight track. In order to assess the quality of the focused data, close-ups of amplitude images are compared, impulse response functions of a point target are analyzed, and the coherence is evaluated. The experimental data were acquired by the German Aerospace Center's E-SAR L-band system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focusing of Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data From Highly Nonlinear Flight Tracks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2007591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4939375/04812049.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2007591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Focusing of Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data From Highly Nonlinear Flight Tracks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4812049/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664044","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focusing of Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data From Highly Nonlinear Flight Tracks","sourcePdf":"tgrs-frey-2007591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080331S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4939375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4939375","articleId":"4812049","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812051,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Kamalanathan","affiliation":["Center for Applied Nanoionics, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Kamalanathan","id":"37946222000"},{"name":"Ugo Russo","affiliation":["Center for Applied Nanoionics, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA","Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Ugo","lastName":"Russo","id":"37570471800"},{"name":"Daniele Ielmini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Ielmini","id":"37275690700"},{"name":"Michael N.

Finally, results are discussed with the aid of an analytical model for erase, which is also used to address the tradeoff between on-state stability and program/erase currents.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2016991","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2016991","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4850262/04812051.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Driven On\u2013Off Transition and Tradeoff With Program and Erase Current in Programmable Metallization Cell (PMC) Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Driven On\u2013Off Transition and Tradeoff With Program and Erase Current in Programmable Metallization Cell (PMC) Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10624924","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812051/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Driven On\u2013Off Transition and Tradeoff With Program and Erase Current in Programmable Metallization Cell (PMC) Memory","sourcePdf":"led-russo-2016991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086239S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4850262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4850262","articleId":"4812051","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812060,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

Based on Galerkin's method, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy PDS is first proposed to model an NPDS. Then, the T-S fuzzy PDS can be represented by a finite-dimensional T-S fuzzy subsystem in controlled mode and a coupled infinite-dimensional T-S fuzzy subsystem in residual mode. Therefore, the NPDS can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional T-S fuzzy slow state-space subsystem to be controlled and a coupled infinite-dimensional fast residual subsystem to be tolerated. Based on the small-gain theorem, a robust fuzzy observer-based controller is developed to tolerate the coupled residual subsystem to asymptotically stabilize the NPDS. Furthermore, based on the dissipative theory, an Hinfin control design is proposed to attenuate the effects of external disturbances and measurement noises on the robust stabilization of NPDSs. The MATLAB linear matrix inequality toolbox can be employed to efficiently solve the optimal Hinfin fuzzy observer-based control design problem of NPDSs. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the design procedure and confirm the performance of the proposed robust fuzzy observer-based control method for the perturbative NPDSs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2020506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

We have developed customized interface circuitry between an external TDS (eTDS) prototype and a commercial powered wheelchair (PWC) as well as three control strategies to evaluate the tongue motion as an alternative control input for wheeled mobility. We tested the eTDS performance in driving PWCs on 12 able-bodied human subjects, of which 11 were novice. The results showed that all subjects could complete navigation tasks by operating the PWC using their tongue motions. Despite little prior experience, the average time using the eTDS and the tongue was only approximately three times longer than using a joystick and the fingers. Navigation time was strongly dependant on the number of issued commands, which reduced by gaining experience. Particularly, the unintended issued commands (the Midas touch problem) were rare, demonstrating the effectiveness of the tongue tracking and external magnetic field cancellation algorithms as well as the safety of the TDS for wheeled mobility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812082/","accessionNumber":"10728325","pubMedId":"19362901","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using Unconstrained Tongue Motion as an Alternative Control Mechanism for Wheeled Mobility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Unconstrained Tongue Motion as an Alternative Control Mechanism for Wheeled Mobility","sourcePdf":"tbme-ghovanloo-2018632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071248S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5071745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5071745","articleId":"4812082","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4812083,"authors":[{"name":"Nasruminallah","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4812083/4812083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nasruminallah received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2006.

However, using human experts for classification is error prone and subjective. Therefore, automatic and computerized methods are needed in order to obtain reproducible and objective results. Although several methods are proposed for this purpose, we demonstrate that their performance is limited when dealing with diverse datasets containing a large number of quality groups. In this work, we test several feature sets and neural network topologies to obtain a better classification performance. During these tests, it is observed that different feature sets represent different subgroup(s) in a quality group rather than representing the whole group. Therefore, our approach is to use these features in a cascaded manner in which a quality group is classified by classifying all of its subgroups. We first realize this approach by using a two-stage cascaded network. Then, we design a hierarchical radial basis function network (HRBFN) in which correctly classified marble samples are taken out of the dataset and a different feature extraction method is applied to the remaining samples at each network level. The HRBFN system produces successful results for industrial applications and facilitates the desirable property of implementation in a quasi real-time manner.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2013816","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5068840/04812089.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"439","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2013816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded and Hierarchical Neural Networks for Classifying Surface Images of Marble Slabs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded and Hierarchical Neural Networks for Classifying Surface Images of Marble Slabs","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10714108","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812089/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded and Hierarchical Neural Networks for Classifying Surface Images of Marble Slabs","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-selver-2013816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174132S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5068840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5068840","articleId":"4812089","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812095,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such a special structure makes the exterior feature of the neural network controller able to become a P, PI, PD, or PID controller as needed. The closed-loop error between directly measured output and expected value of the system is chosen to be the input of the controller. Only a group of initial weights values, which can run the controlled closed-loop system stably, are required to be determined. The proposed controller can update weights of the neural network online according to errors caused by uncertain factors of system such as modeling error and external disturbance, based on stable learning rate. The resilient back-propagation algorithm with sign instead of the gradient is used to update the network weights. The basic ideas, techniques, and system stability proof were presented in detail. Finally, actual experiments both of single and double inverted pendulums were implemented, and the comparison of effectiveness between the proposed controller and the linear optimal regulator were given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10869386","htmlLink":"/document/4812095/","displayDocTitle":"PID-Like Neural Network Nonlinear Adaptive Control for Uncertain Multivariable Motion Control Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PID-Like Neural Network Nonlinear Adaptive Control for Uncertain Multivariable Motion Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-cong-2018433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062224S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"4812095","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4812097,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Jong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4812097/4812097-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiann-Jong Chen was born in Keelong, Taiwan, in 1966.

Experimental results confirm the effectiveness to the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2018535","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04812101.pdf","startPage":"2852","endPage":"2861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2018535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for the Design of Resonant Compensators for Active Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for the Design of Resonant Compensators for Active Filters","volume":"56","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793119","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812101/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for the Design of Resonant Compensators for Active Filters","sourcePdf":"tie-sumner-2018535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083523S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4812101","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812102,"authors":[{"name":"Shahzad Khan","affiliation":["Department of Precision and Microsystems Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/4812102/4812102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahzad Khan (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the M.Sc. degree in electronics from Kanpur University, Kanpur, India, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechatronics programme from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2008.","He was a Research Associate with the Centre for Mechatronics, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, until August 2004.

However, the shortage of this method is that the Euclidean spectral distance measure is used, and therefore, it is sensitive to the magnitude of the spectra. While other spectral matching criteria are available, such as spectral angle mapping (SAM) and spectral information divergence (SID), the current unmixing algorithm is unable to be extended to these measures. In this paper, we propose a unified subpixel mapping framework that models the unmixing process as a best match of the unknown pixel's spectrum to a weighted sum of the endmembers' spectra. We introduce sequential quadratic programming to solve the nonlinear optimization problem encountered in the implementation of this framework. The main feature of this proposed method is that it is not restricted to any particular similarity measures. Experiments were conducted with both simulated and Hyperion data. The tests demonstrated the proposed framework's advantage in accommodating various spectral similarity measures and provided performance comparisons of the Euclidean distance measure with other spectral matching criteria including SAM, spectral correlation measure, and SID.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2011432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5075850/04812103.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2011432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization of Subpixel Analysis for Hyperspectral Data With Flexibility in Spectral Similarity Measures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalization of Subpixel Analysis for Hyperspectral Data With Flexibility in Spectral Similarity Measures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812103/","volume":"47","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4812103/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705114","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization of Subpixel Analysis for Hyperspectral Data With Flexibility in Spectral Similarity Measures","sourcePdf":"tgrs-jia-2011432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078565S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5075850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5075850","articleId":"4812103","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812104,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hui Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5238715/4812104/4812104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hui Zhan (S'09) received the Bachelor's degree in computer science and technology in 2007 from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and other evolutionary computation techniques."]},"firstName":"Zhi-Hui","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37392529300"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5238715/4812104/4812104-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (M'02\u2013SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a Brain Korean 21 Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea.

More importantly, it can perform a global search over the entire search space with faster convergence speed. The APSO consists of two main steps. First, by evaluating the population distribution and particle fitness, a real-time evolutionary state estimation procedure is performed to identify one of the following four defined evolutionary states, including \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">exploration</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">exploitation</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">convergence</i>\n, and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">jumping out</i>\n in each generation. It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">convergence</i>\n state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied. Results show that APSO substantially enhances the performance of the PSO paradigm in terms of convergence speed, global optimality, solution accuracy, and algorithm reliability. As APSO introduces two new parameters to the PSO paradigm only, it does not introduce an additional design or implementation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015956","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5238715/04812104.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10879852","pubMedId":"19362911","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812104/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhang-2015956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148164S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"1135","xplore-issue":"5238715","articleId":"4812104","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":4812105,"authors":[{"name":"Khanh T.

It is shown that a solenoidal magnetic field can be an effective transport mechanism for sheet electron beams, provided the beam tunnel is matched to the beam shape, and vice versa. The advantage of solenoidal magnetic field transport relative to periodic magnetic transport resides in the feasibility of transporting higher current density beams due to the higher average field strength achievable in practice and the lower susceptibility to field errors from mechanical misalignments. In addition, a solenoidally transported electron beam is not susceptible to voltage cutoff as in a periodic magnetic focusing system; hence, device efficiency is potentially higher.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2015420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4839017/04812105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2015420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839017","startPage":"744","endPage":"752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intense Sheet Electron Beam Transport in a Uniform Solenoidal Magnetic Field","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intense Sheet Electron Beam Transport in a Uniform Solenoidal Magnetic Field","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587553","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812105/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intense Sheet Electron Beam Transport in a Uniform Solenoidal Magnetic Field","sourcePdf":"ted-nguyen-2015420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070618S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4839017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4839017","articleId":"4812105","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812106,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Debes","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, Institute of Telecommunications, Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4815947/4812106/4812106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Debes (S'06) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Signal Processing Group, Institute of Telecommunications.","His research interests include detection, classification, and image processing with applications to radar imaging."]},"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Debes","id":"37547122800"},{"name":"Moeness G.

The first control scheme predicts the future evolution of the currents for each possible configuration of the inverter legs. Then, the switching state which minimizes a given cost function is selected and applied during the next sampling time. The second control scheme uses a modulator to apply two configurations of the inverter legs during a computation period. Among these configurations, one leads to null voltages. The duration of the other configuration is calculated in order to minimize the distance between the obtained state vector and the desired one. The third control scheme uses a model of the PMSM in order to predict the stator voltages which allows us to reach the desired currents after one modulation period. An algebraic method is presented to compute the duty cycle of each leg of the inverter in a direct manner. These control schemes are detailed and tested using the same switching frequency on the same test bench (1.6-kW PMSM drive). A simulation study is performed in order to compare sensitivity to parameters of each control scheme. Experiments confirm the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2018429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04812111.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2018429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","startPage":"2715","endPage":"2728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Predictive Current Control Schemes for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine Drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Predictive Current Control Schemes for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine Drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736229","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812111/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Predictive Current Control Schemes for a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine Drive","sourcePdf":"tie-morel-2018429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121471S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4812111","onlineDate":"07 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812114,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"38187655300"},{"name":"Shihua Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281408500"},{"name":"Mei Rong","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Rong","id":"38187634700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4812114","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Symmetric matrices","Covariance matrix","Bit error rate","Channel state information","OFDM modulation","Communication standards","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless communication","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","channel estimation errors","variational inference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel state information","channel impulse response parameters","Monte-Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel imperfections","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","variational inference"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents an iterative detection scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI).

A novel miniaturized CPW-fed tapered slot antenna is proposed and used for transient measurements of UWB radio channels for body area network (BAN) and personal area network (PAN) scenarios. Unlike conventional UWB CPW-fed antennas, the proposed antenna employs two diverging tapered slots to provide smooth and stable impedance matching. Fidelity analysis is applied to evaluate the time-domain behavior of body-worn antennas and it is found that average fidelity obtained is 88% and 86% for the conventional coplanar waveguide fed antenna and the tapered slot antenna, respectively. However, the tapered slot antenna shows a significant size reduction and hence is suited for body-centric wireless communications.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","startPage":"875","endPage":"884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Characteristics of Wearable Antennas and Radio Propagation Channels for Ultrawideband Body-Centric Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transient Characteristics of Wearable Antennas and Radio Propagation Channels for Ultrawideband Body-Centric Wireless Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560819","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812183/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Characteristics of Wearable Antennas and Radio Propagation Channels for Ultrawideband Body-Centric Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"57tap04-aalomainy-part1-2014588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108308S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812190,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Albani","affiliation":["D.I.I., University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812184/4812190/4812190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matteo Albani (M'98) was born in Florence, Italy, on January 5, 1970.

However, most textile fabrics are quite thin (0.5 mm), making it challenging for antenna designers to provide an antenna which operates adequately and resiliently in the 2.4-2.4835-GHz industrial-scientific-medical bandwidth. Flexible pad foam is commonly available in protective clothing and overcomes these constraints by providing a uniform, stable, and sufficient thickness. Moreover, its cellular structure and properties, such as flame retardance and water repellence, make it an excellent substrate material for the integration of antennas into protective garments. In this paper, we describe the design, manufacture, and performance of the first textile planar antenna to be implemented on flexible protective foam, suitable for firefighter garments. We employed shock absorbing foam with a thickness of 3.94 mm and achieved a nearly circularly polarized antenna with a bandwidth of more than 180 MHz even when the antenna was compressed or bent. These outstanding substrate and antenna characteristics result in an antenna that is highly appropriate for garment integration.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","startPage":"919","endPage":"925","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812194.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Textile Antenna for Off-Body Communication Integrated Into Protective Clothing for Firefighters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812194/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Textile Antenna for Off-Body Communication Integrated Into Protective Clothing for Firefighters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560820","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Textile Antenna for Off-Body Communication Integrated Into Protective Clothing for Firefighters","sourcePdf":"57tap04-chertleer-part1-2014574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050223S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"282","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812203,"authors":[{"name":"Pereira Carlos","affiliation":["Department of Microwave, ENST de bretagne, Brest, France","Signal Image and Communication (SIC) Laboratory, University of Poitiers, Poitiers, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812184/4812203/4812203-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pereira Carlos (S'05) received the M.S. degree in mobile radiocommunication from the University of Poitiers, France, in 2005, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Currently, he works as a Ph.D. student in mobile radiocommunication in a collaboration context between the Signal Image and Communication (SIC) Laboratory at the University of Poitiers and the Department of Micro-Wave at ENST-Bretagne, Brest, France.

For these two indoor environments, four levels of description are proposed in order to establish the geometrical and electrical modeling impact on MIMO channel characterization. Results are obtained by analyzing the capacity, variation in correlation, multipath richness and eigenvalues in relation to the polarization, the presence of line-of-sight (LOS) or non-LOS (NLOS) configurations.

Because of the ill-posedness it is necessary to introduce some form of regularization. Many authors apply a smoothing constraint on the reconstructed permittivity profile, but such regularization smooths away sharp edges. In this paper, a simple yet effective regularization strategy, the value picking (VP) regularization, is proposed. This new technique is capable of reconstructing piecewise constant permittivity profiles without degrading the edges. It is based on the knowledge that only a few different permittivity values occur in such profiles, the values of which need not be known in advance. VP regularization does not impose this a priori information in a strict sense, such that it can be applied also to profiles that are only approximately piecewise constant. The VP regularization is introduced in the solution of the inverse problem by adding a choice function to the data fit cost function for every permittivity unknown in the discretized problem. When minimized, the choice function forces the corresponding permittivity unknown to be close to one member of a set of auxiliary variables, the VP values, which are continuously updated throughout the iterations. To minimize the regularized cost function, a half quadratic Gauss-Newton optimization technique is presented. Finally, a stepwise relaxed VP regularization scheme is proposed, in which the number of VP values is gradually increased. This scheme is tested with synthetic and measured scattering data, obtained from inhomogeneous 3D targets, and is shown to achieve high reconstruction quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812212/","accessionNumber":"10571244","displayDocTitle":"A New Value Picking Regularization Strategy\u2014Application to the 3-D Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Value Picking Regularization Strategy\u2014Application to the 3-D Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problem","sourcePdf":"57tap04-jdezaeytijd-part2-2015823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084686S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4812184","articleId":"4812212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4812214,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Pan","affiliation":["Realtek Semiconductor, Wionics Research, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812184/4812214/4812214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Pan (S'04\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in spring 2008.","He was a Graduate Research Assistant with the Georgia Institute of Technology MiRCTECH and ATHENA Research Groups, the Georgia Electronic Design Center (GEDC), and the GT-NSF Packaging Research Center (PRC).

The antenna is a coupled-fed PIFA and shows a height of 9 mm and a width of 13 mm only, when mounted at the top edge of the display panel in the laptop computer. The multiband operation is achieved by using the coupling feed and further embedding a band-notching slit in the radiating arm of the PIFA. With the coupling feed, two wide operating bands can be generated at about 2.5 and 5.5 GHz for the PIFA. By further embedding the slit of length about a quarter-wavelength at about 4 GHz, a band-notching characteristic at about 4 GHz is obtained, which leads to an additional resonance at about 3.5 GHz and shows very small effects on the desired 2.5 and 5.5 GHz bands. This behavior results in successful excitation of an additional resonant mode for 3.5 GHz WiMAX operation. Hence, with no increase in the antenna size, three wide operating bands for covering all the desired operating bands of WLAN/WiMAX systems are achieved for the proposed PIFA. Details of the design considerations are presented, and results of the fabricated prototype are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10571247","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812220/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Uniplanar Printed Coupled-Fed PIFA With a Band-Notching Slit for WLAN/WiMAX Operation in the Laptop Computer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniplanar Printed Coupled-Fed PIFA With a Band-Notching Slit for WLAN/WiMAX Operation in the Laptop Computer","sourcePdf":"57tap04-kwong-part2-2015843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061357S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4812184","articleId":"4812220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812226,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Pelosi","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812181/4812226/4812226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mauro Pelosi (S'08) was born in 1982.

Despite its importance in mobile-phone design and validation processes, it is still difficult to take it into account because of a lack of knowledge in the area. In this paper, a rigorous investigation methodology is described for the study of mobile-phone grip styles over a sample population of 100 subjects. Two main grip styles are identified in the talk mode, while most of the people use both hands in data mode. The index finger location is confirmed to be in the back region of the handset in most cases. The grip style has direct implications in the definition of a phantom hand. Regarding the talk mode, a procedure to estimate the palm-handset gap is proposed. The inclination of the handset with respect to the side of the user's head depends on the mobile-phone form factor and size. Moreover, we show that for the data mode, a worst-case scenario categorization approach is more suitable due to the time-varying nature of the fingers' position on the handset.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812226.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Grip Study for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Telephone sets","Imaging phantoms","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Mobile communication","Guidelines","Humans","Fingers","Electromagnetic wave absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","ergonomics","human factors","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile-phone grip styles","talk modes","data modes","human hand","small terminal antennas","index finger location","palm-handset gap","worst-case scenario categorization","finger position"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna proximity factors","body loss","efficiency","finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","hand phantom"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Grip Study for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812226/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560823","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Grip Study for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","sourcePdf":"57tap04-mpelosi-part1-2014590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070963S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812229,"authors":[{"name":"Nozomi Haga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812181/4812229/4812229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nozomi Haga was born in Yamagata, Japan, in January 1985.

The results show that the proposed antenna has a relatively high efficiency of more than 50% even in the vicinity of the human body.

E-textile antennas show great promise due to their ease of integration with other textile materials, and they are inherently low-mass and flexible relative to conventional antenna materials. Much attention has been given recently to multiple-antenna communication systems due to the increased performance compared to conventional single-antenna systems. For body-centric applications, the low-mass, flexibility, and integration simplicity of e-textile antennas can enable multiple-antenna systems, which otherwise would be precluded by the rigidity and mass of conventional antenna materials. Several examples of this are considered here with e-textile antennas in an array environment. A conventional microstrip array constructed with e-textiles is shown to have robust performance with moderate amounts of bending, similar to that which might be seen with body-worn arrays. In addition to the conventional array, a wideband multiple-antenna system to support a variety of wireless communication protocols, while maintaining polarization diversity and excellent coverage over a majority of the radian sphere is demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antenna arrays","Wireless communication","Antenna arrays","Microstrip antennas","Diversity methods","Personnel","Navigation","Adaptive arrays","Textiles","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","microstrip antenna arrays","microwave materials","textile fibres","UHF antennas","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body-worn e-textile antennas","wireless data","body-centric platform","textile material","multiple antenna communication systems","microstrip array","radian sphere"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","beamforming","conformal antennas","diversity methods","e-textile antennas"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812238.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Body-Worn E-Textile Antennas: The Good, the Low-Mass, and the Conformal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Body-Worn E-Textile Antennas: The Good, the Low-Mass, and the Conformal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812238/","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812238/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10571234","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Body-Worn E-Textile Antennas: The Good, the Low-Mass, and the Conformal","sourcePdf":"57tap04-tkennedy-part1-2014602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082129S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4812243,"authors":[{"name":"Gareth A.

In particular, the study focused on the performance of a compact higher mode microstrip patch antenna (HMMPA) with a profile as low as lambda/20. The 5- and 10-mm-high HMMPA prototypes had an impedance bandwidth of 6.7% and 8.6%, respectively, sufficient for the operating requirements of the 2.45-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band and both antennas offered 11-dB higher path gain compared to a fundamental-mode microstrip patch antenna. It was also demonstrated that a 7-dB improvement in path gain can be obtained for a fundamental-mode patch through the addition of a shortening wall. Notably, on-body HMMPA performance was comparable to a quarter wave monopole antenna on the same size of groundplane, mounted normal to the tissue surface, indicating that the low-profile and physically more robust antenna is a promising solution for bodyworn antenna applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10560828","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812243/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Antennas for Over-Body-Surface Communication at 2.45 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antennas for Over-Body-Surface Communication at 2.45 GHz","sourcePdf":"tap-scanlon-part1-2014525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072049S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812244,"authors":[{"name":"Simon L.

The work was based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 2.45 GHz representative of an indoor sweep and search scenario for fire and rescue personnel. Using maximum-likelihood estimation in conjunction with the Akaike information criterion (AIC), five candidate probability distributions were investigated and from these the kappa- mu distribution was found to best describe small-scale fading observed in the body-to-body channels. Additional channel parameters such as autocorrelation and the cross-correlation coefficient between fading signal envelopes were also analyzed. Low cross correlation and small differences in mean signal levels between potential dual-branch diversity receivers suggested that the prospect of successfully implementing diversity in this type application is extremely good. Moreover, using selection combination, maximal ratio, and equal gain combining, up to 8.69-dB diversity gain can be made available when four spatially separated antennas are used at the receiver. Additional improvements in the combined envelopes through lower level crossing rates and fade durations at low signal levels were also observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Characterization for Single- and Multiple-Antenna Wearable Systems Used for Indoor Body-to-Body Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014576","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812244.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Characterization for Single- and Multiple-Antenna Wearable Systems Used for Indoor Body-to-Body Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812244/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560829","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Characterization for Single- and Multiple-Antenna Wearable Systems Used for Indoor Body-to-Body Communications","sourcePdf":"57tap04-wscanlon-part1-2014576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098049S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812245,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xia","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812181/4812245/4812245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Xia was born in Heilongjiang, China, in September 1981.

These implantable devices are embedded into the human or pet body. The vital information (such as temperature, blood pressure, cardiac beat, etc.) can be transmitted from implantable devices to the external equipment by use of a wireless communication link. Therefore, the research on the antenna for implantable devices (implanted antennas) is very important. This paper proposes an implanted H-shaped cavity slot antenna for short-range wireless communications. This type of antenna, which is designed to operate at the industrial-scientific-medical band (2.45 GHz), is investigated by using finite-difference time-domain calculation. We analyzed the performances of the proposed antenna which is embedded into the human body between the shoulder and the elbow. However, since the proposed antenna is too small to fabricate, a scale model is adopted for antenna measurements. Some characteristics of the scale model of the antenna are also calculated and measured by using the 2/3 muscle-equivalent phantom. The results show that the proposed antenna has promise for use in an implant.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812245.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performances of an Implanted Cavity Slot Antenna Embedded in the Human Arm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812245/","displayDocTitle":"Performances of an Implanted Cavity Slot Antenna Embedded in the Human Arm","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571236","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812245/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performances of an Implanted Cavity Slot Antenna Embedded in the Human Arm","sourcePdf":"57tap04-wxia-part1-2014579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085398S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812247,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Sani","affiliation":["Queen Mary College, University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812181/4812247/4812247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Sani (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in telecommunication engineering from \u201cUniversita degli studi di Firenze\u201d, Florence, Italy, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in antennas and electromagnetics at Queen Mary College, University of London, London, U.K.","His main research interests include computational electromagnetic, flexible compact antennas for WBANs and medical implants, numerical modelling of body-worn and implanted devices, and radio propagation characterization for UWB body-centric wireless communications.

The equivalence principle is used as an interface between the two computational domains. We apply this technique to analyze on body antenna and channel characteristics for three different planar body-worn antennas operating at the industrial-scientific-medical frequency band of 2.4 GHz.

The conformal chandelier meandered dipole antenna (CCMDA), which is an extension of the offset planar meandered dipole and envelopes the capsule surface, is then investigated. The return loss, input impedance, and radiation pattern characteristics of the CCMDA are discussed in detail at the operating frequency of 1.4 GHz. Additionally, electrical components (specifically the batteries) are modeled inside the capsule to investigate their effects on the conformal antenna performance in free space. The capsule antenna is then inserted into a simple box model (a simplification of the human torso) and a 4-mm precision human-body model (Ansoft) where the detuning effects are observed and discussed. Finally, a circularly polarized receiver antenna design consisting of orthogonal dipoles is suggested which provides polarization diversity and is miniaturized to fit into a personal digital assistant (PDA) for portability of the data telemetric link.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812248.pdf","startPage":"900","endPage":"909","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conformal Ingestible Capsule Antenna: A Novel Chandelier Meandered Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Conformal Ingestible Capsule Antenna: A Novel Chandelier Meandered Design","htmlLink":"/document/4812248/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571238","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conformal Ingestible Capsule Antenna: A Novel Chandelier Meandered Design","sourcePdf":"57tap04-yrahmat-samii-part1-2014598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056774S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4812249,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812181/4812249/4812249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Wang received the B.Sc. degree from the Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), Beijing, China, in 2002, the M.Sc.E.E. from Chalmers University of Technology (CTH), G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2008.","He has been involved in research including radio channel measurements and modelling for personal-area networks and body-area networks as well as PHY- and MAC-layer optimizations for ultrawideband and multiple-input multiple-output systems."]},"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37678495000"},{"name":"Ivan B.

Four single-element transmitters and eight quad-element receivers were mounted on three test people. Both directional and omnidirectional antennas have been investigated. A comparison between electromagnetic antenna simulations and the measurements shows that the multipath environment reduces the body losses effectively. Channel characterizations in terms of path loss, body shadowing, small-scale fading, and spatial correlation have been derived. Small path-loss exponents (< 2.0) are observed in the investigated environments. Considerable power loss due to body blockage makes the body shadowing a prominent factor in the short-range body-to-body communications. Distributed antenna selection diversity is presented to mitigate the body shadowing. A 5-dB diversity gain in the average received power at the mean and 10% outage levels have been identified based on the measurements with two distributed antennas mounted on the transmitter and receiver person and without channel-state information feedback to the transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812181/04812249.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2014580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2014580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the Indoor Multiantenna Body-to-Body Radio Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Radio transmitters","Shadow mapping","Broadband antennas","Electromagnetic measurements","Time domain analysis","Receivers","Testing","Directive antennas","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna testing","body area networks","broadband antennas","directive antennas","diversity reception","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna body-to-body radio channel","time-domain radio channel","quad-element receiver","omnidirectional antenna","directional antenna testing","distributed antenna selection diversity","single-element transmitter","small-scale fading","spatial correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body-to-body communication","body shadowing","selection diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the Indoor Multiantenna Body-to-Body Radio Channel","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571239","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the Indoor Multiantenna Body-to-Body Radio Channel","sourcePdf":"57tap04-ywang-part1-2014580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105734S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4812181","articleId":"4812249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812250,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Su","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4812184/4812250/4812250-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Su (M'07) was born in China, in 1977.

The calculated currents are used to update the electric fields at the locations occupied by the embedded network according to Ampere's law. The simulation results using this method have been compared with the results simulated by Lumped-Element FDTD method (LE-FDTD), showing very good agreement. The method presented here is highly accurate and stable, and is suitable for use in quite general cases, especially where the embedded network cannot easily be represented by lumped elements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2015830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4812184/04812250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2015830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812184","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Incorporation of Scattering Parameters Into the FDTD Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Incorporation of Scattering Parameters Into the FDTD Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560851","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812250/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Incorporation of Scattering Parameters Into the FDTD Algorithm","sourcePdf":"57tap04-zsu-part2-2015830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073465S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4812184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4812184","articleId":"4812250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812293,"authors":[{"name":"Hans J.

Hamming EDAC is the preferred scheme for fast, random access memories. It allows for the correction of a single bit error within a word and the detection of a double bit error. The common assumption is that the likelihood of an uncorrectable double bit error is very small.

Two different circuits were integrated in the NINO13 chip, processed in IBM 130 nm CMOS technology. The LCO version (Low Capacitance and consumption Optimization) was designed for potential use as front-end electronics in the Gigatracker of the NA62 experiment at CERN. It was developed as pixel readout for solid-state pixel detectors to permit minimum ionizing particle detection with less than 180 ps rms resolution per pixel on the output pulse, for power consumption below 300 muW per pixel. The HCO version (High Capacitance Optimization) was designed with 4 mW power consumption per channel to provide timing resolution below 20 ps rms on the output pulse, for charges above 10 fC. Results presented show the potential of the LCO and HCO circuits for the precise timing readout of solid-state detectors, vacuum tubes or gas detectors, for applications in high energy physics, bio-technologies or medical imaging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812299/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571144","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Amplifier-Discriminators for High Time Resolution Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Amplifier-Discriminators for High Time Resolution Detection","sourcePdf":"tns-despeisse-2013350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048529S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4812278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4812278","articleId":"4812299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4812302,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Szczygiel","affiliation":["Department of Measurement and Instrumentation, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Szczygiel","id":"37268979200"},{"name":"Pawel Grybos","affiliation":["Department of Measurement and Instrumentation, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Grybos","id":"37279824900"},{"name":"Piotr Maj","affiliation":["Department of Measurement and Instrumentation, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Maj","id":"37296311800"},{"name":"Akira Tsukiyama","affiliation":["X-ray Research Laboratory, Rigaku Corporation, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Tsukiyama","id":"37397015800"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Matsushita","affiliation":["X-ray Research Laboratory, Rigaku Corporation, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Matsushita","id":"37400466300"},{"name":"Takeyoshi Taguchi","affiliation":["X-ray Research Laboratory, Rigaku Corporation, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeyoshi","lastName":"Taguchi","id":"37403691800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4812302","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Semiconductor device noise","X-ray detection","X-ray detectors","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse measurements","X-ray imaging","CMOS process","Counting circuits","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","random-access storage","readout electronics","silicon radiation detectors","X-ray apparatus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RG64","multichannel ASIC","continuous readout mode","energy window selection","X-ray imaging","semiconductor detectors","CMOS process","charge sensitive amplifier","discriminators","RAM memory buffers","DC coupled silicon strip detectors","AC coupled silicon strip detectors","X-ray photons","size 0.35 mum","size 3900 mum","size 5000 mum","time 75 ns","storage capacity 8 bit","storage capacity 20 bit","capacitance 1 pF","power 5 mW","electron volt energy 8.04 keV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-noise electronics","mixed signal circuits"]}],"abstract":"We report on the performance of a low noise and high count rate readout ASIC with binary architecture and energy window selection for X-ray imaging applications using semiconductor detectors.

The core of RG64 consists of 64 readout channels. Each channel is built of a charge sensitive amplifier with a second order shaper of peaking time 75 ns, two independent discriminators with an 8-bit offset correction circuit and two independent 20-bit counters with RAM memory buffers. The ENC of the circuit reaches the value of about 126 el. rms with 1 pF input load and 5 mW power consumption per single channel. The mean gain in the multichannel ASIC is about 50 muV/el., with the dispersion from channel to channel of 0.9% (on one sigma level). The deviation of the effective threshold voltage spread for given energy can be reduced to less than 7 el. rms (calculated to the charge sensitive amplifier input). High count rate measurements have been performed up to 2 Mcps of average rate of input pulses, both for AC and DC coupled silicon strip detectors with X-ray photons of energy 8.04 keV.

Sensor nodes need to operate with very low-power consumption and under the constraint of limited memory capacity. Therefore, it is wasteful to digitize the sensor signal at a constant sample rate, given that the frequency contents of the signals vary with time. Adaptive sampling is established as a practical method to reduce the sample data volume. In this paper a low-power analog system is proposed, which adjusts the converter clock rate to perform a peak-picking algorithm on the second derivative of the input signal. The presented implementation does not require an analog-to-digital converter or a digital processor in the sample selection process. The criteria for selecting a suitable detection threshold are discussed, so that the maximum sampling error can be limited. A circuit level implementation is presented. Measured results exhibit a significant reduction in the average sample frequency and data rate of over 50% and 38%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008648","startPage":"183","endPage":"189","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4812307/04812313.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling System for Sensor Nodes in Body Area Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling System for Sensor Nodes in Body Area Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812313/","accessionNumber":"10560671","pubMedId":"19362898","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812313/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Sampling System for Sensor Nodes in Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"tnsre-rrieger-2008648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08027S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4812307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4812307","articleId":"4812313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4812332,"authors":[{"name":"Jingya Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4812332/4812332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingya Dai (S\u201906) received the B.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

In these medium voltage (2.3-13.8 kV) level applications, current-source converters not only have inherent advantages, but also present some challenges for controller design due to the DC link choke and filter capacitors. The control strategy is developed to achieve better performances with improved dynamic response. By maintaining the grid-side converter modulation index at the highest possible level, the proposed control scheme reduces the DC link current to a minimum value to reduce converter conduction loss. The systempsilas dynamic performance is further improved by adopting generator-side power feedforward. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the proposed control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812316/04812332.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2010259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2010259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Control Scheme for Current-Source-Converter-Based PMSG Wind Energy Conversion Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Wind energy","Synchronous generators","Bridge circuits","Mesh generation","Wind energy generation","Medium voltage","Voltage control","Inductors","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","feedforward","machine control","permanent magnet generators","power convertors","power grids","power system control","synchronous generators","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-source-converter","PMSG wind energy conversion system","permanent-magnet synchronous generator","controller design","DC link choke","grid-side converter modulation index","converter conduction loss","power feedforward control","DC link current control","voltage 2.3 kV to 13.8 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current source converter (CSC)","permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)","power feedforward control","wind energy conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Control Scheme for Current-Source-Converter-Based PMSG Wind Energy Conversion Systems","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812332/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571157","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Control Scheme for Current-Source-Converter-Based PMSG Wind Energy Conversion Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-dai-2010259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113354S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"4812316","articleId":"4812332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4812334,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan W.

In many applications, conventional approaches are too expensive, too large, or unreliable. For short-term needs, primary batteries may be used. However, they do not scale up well for long-term installations. Instead, energy harvesting methods must be used. Here, a system design approach is introduced that results in a highly reliable, highly available energy harvesting device for remote applications. First, a simulation method that uses climate data and target availability produces Pareto curves for energy storage and generation. This step determines the energy storage requirement in watt-hours and the energy generation requirement in watts. Cost, size, reliability, and longevity requirements are considered to choose particular storage and generation technologies, and then to specify particular components. The overall energy processing system is designed for modularity, fault tolerance, and energy flow control capability. Maximum power point tracking is used to optimize solar panel performance. The result is a highly reliable, highly available power source. Several prototypes have been constructed and tested. Experimental results are shown for one device that uses multicrystalline silicon solar cells and lithium-iron-phosphate batteries to achieve 100% availability. Future designers can use the same approach to design systems for a wide range of power requirements and installation locations.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812316/04812334.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"952","endPage":"962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System Design Approach for Unattended Solar Energy Harvesting Supply","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A System Design Approach for Unattended Solar Energy Harvesting Supply","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812334/","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4812334/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560783","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System Design Approach for Unattended Solar Energy Harvesting Supply","sourcePdf":"tpel-kimball-2009056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109985S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4812316","articleId":"4812334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812337,"authors":[{"name":"Ru Yang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4812337/4812337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ru Yang was born in China.

The main goal of this work is to define the power stage operation mode that guarantees the highest possible efficiency. The results suggest a method to select the physical parameters (operation frequency, characteristic impedance, transformer ratio, etc.) to achieve that efficiency improvement. The research clarifies also the effects of the physical separation between both halves of the ferromagnetic core on the characteristics of the transformer. It is shown that for practical values of the separation distance, the leakage inductance, being part of the resonant inductor, remains almost unchanged. Nevertheless, the current distribution between the primary and the secondary windings changes significantly due to the large variation of the magnetizing inductance. An approximation in the circuit analysis permits to obtain more rapidly the changing values of the converter parameters. The analysis results in a set of equations which solutions are presented graphically. The graphics show a shift of the best efficiency operation zone, compared to the converter with an ideally coupled transformer. Experimental results are presented confirming that expected tendency.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003188","startPage":"685","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04812339.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant Contactless Energy Transfer With Improved Efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resonant Contactless Energy Transfer With Improved Efficiency","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10586863","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812339/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant Contactless Energy Transfer With Improved Efficiency","sourcePdf":"tpel-valtchev-2003188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070212S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4812339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4812387,"authors":[{"name":"Tiancheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Tiancheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37311042700"},{"name":"Ninghui Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Ninghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279907500"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601220800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812387","dbTime":"61 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":536},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Influenza","Data privacy","Cancer","Protection","Diseases","Association rules","Hospitals","Lungs","Data engineering","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","estimation theory","inference mechanisms","publishing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data anonymization","adversary background knowledge","data publishing","kernel estimation methods","using Bayesian inference techniques","skyline (B, t)-privacy model","privacy protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Privacy","Data Security","Anonymity","Kernel Estimation"]}],"abstract":"Recent work has shown the importance of considering the adversary's background knowledge when reasoning about privacy in data publishing.

This paper presents a general framework for modeling the adversary's background knowledge using kernel estimation methods. This framework subsumes different types of knowledge (e.g., negative association rules) that can be mined from the data. Under this framework, we reason about privacy using Bayesian inference techniques and propose the skyline (B, t)-privacy model, which allows the data publisher to enforce privacy requirements to protect the data against adversaries with different levels of background knowledge. Through an extensive set of experiments, we show the effects of probabilistic background knowledge in data anonymization and the effectiveness of our approach in both privacy protection and utility preservation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Integrating Background Knowledge in Data Anonymization","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.86","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812387.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Integrating Background Knowledge in Data Anonymization","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812387/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571501","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Integrating Background Knowledge in Data Anonymization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545a006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141454S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812414,"authors":[{"name":"Arjun Dasgupta","affiliation":["University of Texas, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Arjun","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"38187632800"},{"name":"Nan Zhang","affiliation":["George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288736400"},{"name":"Gautam Das","affiliation":["University of Texas, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Gautam","lastName":"Das","id":"37086392345"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812414","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"A large number of online databases are hidden behind form-like interfaces which allow users to execute search queries by specifying selection conditions in the interface.

Recently, answering keyword queries on graph-structured data has emerged as an important research topic. The prevalent approaches build on dedicated indexing techniques as well as search algorithms aiming at finding substructures that connect the data elements matching the keywords. In this paper, we introduce a novel keyword search paradigm for graph-structured data, focusing in particular on the RDF data model. Instead of computing answers directly as in previous approaches, we first compute queries from the keywords, allowing the user to choose the appropriate query, and finally, process the query using the underlying database engine. Thereby, the full range of database optimization techniques can be leveraged for query processing. For the computation of queries, we propose a novel algorithm for the exploration of top-k matching subgraphs. While related techniques search the best answer trees, our algorithm is guaranteed to compute all k subgraphs with lowest costs, including cyclic graphs. By performing exploration only on a summary data structure derived from the data graph, we achieve promising performance improvements compared to other approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.119","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.119","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812421.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Top-k Exploration of Query Candidates for Efficient Keyword Search on Graph-Shaped (RDF) Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Top-k Exploration of Query Candidates for Efficient Keyword Search on Graph-Shaped (RDF) Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571535","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812421/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Top-k Exploration of Query Candidates for Efficient Keyword Search on Graph-Shaped (RDF) Data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545a405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088637S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812439,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Behm","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Behm","id":"38062117200"},{"name":"Shengyue Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shengyue","lastName":"Ji","id":"37399189200"},{"name":"Chen Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Li","id":"37278182300"},{"name":"Jiaheng Lu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Data Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, Renmin University of China, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404386600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812439","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Data engineering","Intrusion detection","Information systems","Delay","Computer science","Laboratories","Knowledge engineering","Application software","Cleaning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","indexing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-constrained gram-based indexing","answering approximate string queries","data cleaning","query relaxation","spell checking","query processing","inverted-list compression techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate String Search","Compression","Inverted Lists","Grams"]}],"abstract":"Answering approximate queries on string collections is important in applications such as data cleaning, query relaxation, and spell checking, where inconsistencies and errors exist in user queries as well as data. Many existing algorithms use gram-based inverted-list indexing structures to answer approximate string queries. These indexing structures are \"notoriously\" large compared to the size of their original string collection. In this paper, we study how to reduce the size of such an indexing structure to a given amount of space, while retaining efficient query processing. We first study how to adopt existing inverted-list compression techniques to solve our problem. Then, we propose two novel approaches for achieving the goal: one is based on discarding gram lists, and one is based on combining correlated lists. They are both orthogonal to existing compression techniques, exploit a unique property of our setting, and offer new opportunities for improving query performance. For each approach we analyze its effect on query performance and develop algorithms for wisely choosing lists to discard or combine. Our extensive experiments on real data sets show that our approaches provide applications the flexibility in deciding the tradeoff between query performance and indexing size, and can outperform existing compression techniques. An interesting and surprising finding is that while we can reduce the index size significantly (up to 60% reduction) with tolerable performance penalties, for 20-40% reductions we can even improve query performance compared to original indexes.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.32","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812439.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Constrained Gram-Based Indexing for Efficient Approximate String Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Space-Constrained Gram-Based Indexing for Efficient Approximate String Search","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571552","htmlLink":"/document/4812439/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Constrained Gram-Based Indexing for Efficient Approximate String Search","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545a604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119842S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4812461,"authors":[{"name":"Gjergji Kasneci","affiliation":["Database and Information Systems, Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Gjergji","lastName":"Kasneci","id":"38131037300"},{"name":"Maya Ramanath","affiliation":["Database and Information Systems, Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Ramanath","id":"37283162200"},{"name":"Mauro Sozio","affiliation":["Database and Information Systems, Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Sozio","id":"38187837700"},{"name":"Fabian M.

Often such data comes with expressive node and edge labels that allow an interpretation as a semantic graph, and edge weights that reflect the strengths of semantic relations between entities. Finding close relationships between a given set of two, three, or more entities is an important building block for many search, ranking, and analysis tasks. From an algorithmic point of view, this translates into computing the best Steiner trees between the given nodes, a classical NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a new approximation algorithm, coined STAR, for relationship queries over large relationship graphs. We prove that for n query entities, STAR yields an O(log(n))-approximation of the optimal Steiner tree in pseudopolynomial run-time, and show that in practical cases the results returned by STAR are qualitatively comparable to or even better than the results returned by a classical 2-approximation algorithm. We then describe an extension to our algorithm to return the top-k Steiner trees. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over both main-memory as well as completely diskresident graphs containing millions of nodes. Our experiments show that in terms of efficiency STAR outperforms the best state-of-the-art database methods by a large margin, and also returns qualitatively better results.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.64","startPage":"868","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812461.pdf","endPage":"879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.64","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812461/","displayDocTitle":"STAR: Steiner-Tree Approximation in Relationship Graphs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4812461/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10571574","publicationDate":"March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STAR: Steiner-Tree Approximation in Relationship Graphs","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545a868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068703S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812465,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Xiao","affiliation":["NICTA, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38190383000"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["NICTA, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280460000"},{"name":"Xuemin Lin","affiliation":["NICTA, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Xuemin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37274732800"},{"name":"Haichuan Shang","affiliation":["NICTA, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Haichuan","lastName":"Shang","id":"37397316900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812465","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":787},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Web pages","Filtering","Euclidean distance","Data engineering","Pattern recognition","Large-scale systems","Couplings","Data mining","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["top-k set similarity joins","Web page detection","data integration","pattern recognition","top-k pairs","prefix filtering principle","large-scale real datasets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812465","abstract":"Similarity join is a useful primitive operation underlying many applications, such as near duplicate Web page detection, data integration, and pattern recognition.

Many real-world applications such as data stream analysis requires continuous cluster operation. Unfortunately, today's large-scale cluster systems are still vulnerable to various software and hardware problems. System administrators are often overwhelmed by the tasks of correcting various system anomalies such as processing bottlenecks (i.e., full stream buffers), resource hot spots, and service level objective (SLO) violations. Our anomaly prediction scheme raises early alerts for impending system anomalies and suggests possible anomaly causes. Specifically, we employ Bayesian classification methods to capture different anomaly symptoms and infer anomaly causes. Markov models are introduced to capture the changing patterns of different measurement metrics. More importantly, our scheme combines Markov models and Bayesian classification methods to predict when a system anomaly will appear in the foreseeable future and what are the possible anomaly causes. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first stream-based mining algorithm for predicting system anomalies. We have implemented our approach within the IBM System S distributed stream processing cluster, and conducted case study experiments using fully implemented distributed data analysis applications processing real application workloads. Our experiments show that our approach efficiently predicts and diagnoses several bottleneck anomalies with high accuracy while imposing low overhead to the cluster system.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.128","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812472.pdf","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Anomaly Prediction for Robust Cluster Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812472/","displayDocTitle":"Online Anomaly Prediction for Robust Cluster Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571585","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812472/","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Anomaly Prediction for Robust Cluster Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545b000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071798S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4812494,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Manjhi","affiliation":["Google, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Manjhi","id":"37426633300"},{"name":"Charles Garrod","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Garrod","id":"37688805900"},{"name":"Bruce M.

As examples of our concept, we propose and evaluate two source-to-source holistic transformations that focus on hiding the latencies of database queries. We argue that opportunities for applying these transformations will continue to exist in Web applications.

However, writes, especially random writes, on the flash disk are inherently much slower than reads because of the erase-before-write mechanism. To address this asymmetry of read-write speeds in indexing on the flash disk, we propose the FD-tree, a tree index designed with the logarithmic method and fractional cascading techniques. With the logarithmic method, an FD-tree consists of the head tree - a small B+-tree on the top, and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing sizes at the bottom. This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in particular, an index search will potentially go through more levels or visit more nodes, but random writes are limited to the head tree and are subsequently transformed into sequential ones through merging into the lower runs. With the fractional cascading technique, we store pointers, called fences, in lower level runs to speed up the search. We evaluate the FD-tree in comparison with representative B+-tree variants under a variety of workloads. Our results show that the FD-tree has a similar search performance to the standard B+-tree, and a similar update performance to the write-optimized B+-tree variant. As a result, FD-tree outperforms all these B+-tree index variants on both update- and search-intensive workloads.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.226","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812526.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.226","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree Indexing on Flash Disks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tree Indexing on Flash Disks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812526/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571639","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree Indexing on Flash Disks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545b303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044961S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4812530,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Li","affiliation":["University of Illinois, USA","Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Li","id":"37423497900"},{"name":"Zhenhui Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenhui","lastName":"Li","id":"38559791300"},{"name":"Jiawei Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Han","id":"37276626200"},{"name":"Jae-Gil Lee","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA","University of Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Jae-Gil","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538769500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812530","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":1122},"abstract":"Outlier detection in vehicle traffic data is a practical problem that has gained traction lately due to an increasing capability to track moving vehicles in city roads. In contrast to other applications, this particular domain includes a very dynamic dimension: time. Many existing algorithms have studied the problem of outlier detection at a single instant in time. This study proposes a method for detecting temporal outliers with an emphasis on historical similarity trends between data points. Outliers are calculated from drastic changes in the trends. Experiments with real world traffic data show that this approach is effective and efficient.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Outlier Detection in Vehicle Traffic Data","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.230","endPage":"1322","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","startPage":"1319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812530","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Road vehicles","Cities and towns","Data engineering","Computer science","Vehicle dynamics","Global Positioning System","Radiofrequency identification","Traction motors","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal outlier detection","vehicle traffic data","track moving vehicles","historical similarity trends"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Outlier Detection in Vehicle Traffic Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571643","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Outlier Detection in Vehicle Traffic Data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545b319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088309S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4812596,"authors":[{"name":"Divyakant Agrawal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, USA, USA"],"firstName":"Divyakant","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37279997100"},{"name":"Amr El Abbadi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, USA, USA"],"firstName":"Amr El","lastName":"Abbadi","id":"37352473800"},{"name":"Fatih Emekci","affiliation":["LinkedIn Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Emekci","id":"37283159500"},{"name":"Ahmed Metwally","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Metwally","id":"37283333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3422-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4812596","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1884},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Outsourcing","Data privacy","Cryptography","Software maintenance","Hardware","Memory","Costs","Web and internet services","Computer crashes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","database management systems","fault tolerant computing","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management","data outsourcing","third party service provider","software upgrades","database service","home machines","governmental legislations","privacy preserving","data encyrption","database service providers","privacy preserving algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Data outsourcing or database as a service is a new paradigm for data management in which a third party service provider hosts a database as a service. The service provides data management for its customers and thus obviates the need for the service user to purchase expensive hardware and software, deal with software upgrades and hire professionals for administrative and maintenance tasks. Since using an external database service promises reliable data storage at a low cost it is very attractive for companies. Such a service would also provide universal access, through the Internet to private data stored at reliable and secure sites. A client would store their data, and not need to carry their data with them as they travel. They would also not need to log remotely to their home machines, which may suffer from crashes and be unavailable. However, recent governmental legislations, competition among companies, and database thefts mandate companies to use secure and privacy preserving data management techniques. The data provider, therefore, needs to guarantee that the data is secure, be able to execute queries on the data, and the results of the queries must also be secure and not visible to the data provider. Current research has been focused only on how to index and query encrypted data. However, querying encrypted data is computationally very expensive. Providing an efficient trust mechanism to push both database service providers and clients to behave honestly has emerged as one of the most important problem before data outsourcing to become a viable paradigm. In this paper, we describe scalable privacy preserving algorithms for data outsourcing. Instead of encryption, which is computationally expensive, we use distribution on multiple data provider sites and information theoretically proven secret sharing algorithms as the basis for privacy preserving outsourcing. The technical contributions of this paper is the establishment and development of a framework for efficient fault-tolerant scalable and theoretically secure privacy preserving data outsourcing that supports a diversity of database operations executed on different types of data, which can even leverage publicly available data sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2009.151","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812371/4812372/04812596.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2009.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Database Management as a Service: Challenges and Opportunities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812596/","displayDocTitle":"Database Management as a Service: Challenges and Opportunities","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10571709","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812596/","conferenceDate":"29 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database Management as a Service: Challenges and Opportunities","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3545b709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113808S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812371","isNumber":"4812372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812371","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4812372","articleId":"4812596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812625,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas Molina","affiliation":["COPPE of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-COPPE/UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Av.

There is described a simplified non-linear dynamic model for the knee opening angle. The model parameter identification is made using a least squares batch estimator. Based on the estimated non-linear model, two strategies for joint controllers are designed: PID and model reference adaptive controller. The PID design follows a root locus approach with experimental tuning. Preliminary tests were performed in a platform built for the prosthesis under development.

Automatic failure diagnosis support mechanisms can potentially narrow down, or even localize faults within a very short time which both helps to preserve system availability. A large class of automatic failure diagnosis approaches consists of two steps: 1) computation of component anomaly scores; 2) global correlation of the anomaly scores for fault localization. In this paper, we present an architecture-centric approach for the second step. In our approach, component anomaly scores are correlated based on architectural dependency graphs of the software system and a rule set to address error propagation. Moreover, the results are graphically visualized in order to support fault localization and to enhance maintainability. The visualization combines architectural diagrams automatically derived from monitoring data with failure diagnosis results. In a case study, the approach is applied to a distributed sample Web application which is subject to fault injection.","doi":"10.1109/CSMR.2009.15","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812720/4812721/04812738.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR.2009.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Failure Diagnosis Support in Distributed Large-Scale Software Systems Based on Timing Behavior Anomaly Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812738/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Failure Diagnosis Support in Distributed Large-Scale Software Systems Based on Timing Behavior Anomaly Correlation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10574947","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812738/","conferenceDate":"24-27 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Failure Diagnosis Support in Distributed Large-Scale Software Systems Based on Timing Behavior Anomaly Correlation","confLoc":"Kaiserslautern, Germany","sourcePdf":"3589a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059526S","chronDate":"24-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812720","isNumber":"4812721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812720","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4812721","articleId":"4812738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4812762,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Garcia","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37308005600"},{"name":"Daniel Popescu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37320988800"},{"name":"George Edwards","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Edwards","id":"37311720000"},{"name":"Nenad Medvidovic","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nenad","lastName":"Medvidovic","id":"37271749400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3589-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1534-5351"}],"articleNumber":"4812762","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812762","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Software maintenance","Software design","Software systems","Design engineering","Computer science","Software architecture","Computer industry","Application software","Technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","reverse engineering","software architecture","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architectural bad smell identification","design fragments","software architectures","system maintainability","system lifecycle properties","reverse engineering","grid technologies","industrial system refactoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Maintenance","Software Architecture","Architectural Bad Smells","Architectural Refactoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSMR.2009.59","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4812720/4812721/04812762.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR.2009.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Architectural Bad Smells","abstract":"Certain design fragments in software architectures can have a negative impact on system maintainability.

We also describe four representative architectural smells we encountered in the context of reverse-engineering eighteen grid technologies and refactoring one large industrial system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812762/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10574963","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812762/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Architectural Bad Smells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Architectural Bad Smells","confLoc":"Kaiserslautern, Germany","sourcePdf":"3589a255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030324S","chronDate":"24-27 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4812720","isNumber":"4812721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812720","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4812721","articleId":"4812762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":4812825,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Yaacoub","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37391781400"},{"name":"Zaher Dawy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Zaher","lastName":"Dawy","id":"37268830800"},{"name":"Ali El-Hajj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"El-Hajj","id":"37284079700"},{"name":"Karim Y.

The algorithm is based on Lagrangian relaxation where the non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into a master problem and a subproblem. Subproblem has a similar form as standard weighted sum rate maximization subject to total transmit power. Standard subgradient method is used in the master problem and a suboptimal algorithm inspired from primal decomposition techniques is also proposed to approximately solve the subproblem.

In this investigation, performance of LS algorithm in a training-based as well as a semi-blind channel estimation evaluated and their results has been compared. Simulation results show that performance of a semi-blind estimator is better than a training-based estimator. It is interesting for us due to transmitting less required training bits than a training-based algorithm and hence lower redundancy. Therefore we will achieve more bandwidth efficiency with better performance. Training-based method needs 100 times more additional bits than semi-blind method whereas semi-blind method needs only 25% more computational time to convergence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of LS algorithm in both Training-Based and Semi-Blind channel estimations for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","doi":"10.1109/WD.2008.4812848","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808202/4812823/04812848.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2008.4812848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of LS algorithm in both Training-Based and Semi-Blind channel estimations for MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812848/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560860","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of LS algorithm in both Training-Based and Semi-Blind channel estimations for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569140171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04296S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808202","isNumber":"4812823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808202","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4812823","articleId":"4812848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4812849,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Assaad","affiliation":["Ecole Superieure d''Electricite, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Assaad","id":"37269223500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2828-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2829-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"4812849","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Resource management","Delay","Streaming media","OFDM","Bandwidth","WiMAX","Long Term Evolution","Scheduling algorithm","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","frequency division multiple access","Internet","media streaming","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["streaming services","OFDMA systems","frequency time scheduler with delay constraints","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","Internet","multimedia application","wireless systems","stringent QoS constraints","opportunistic scheduler","cell capacity","quality of service"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel Frequency Time scheduler, called Frequency Time Scheduler with Delay Constraints (FTSDC), in order to handle streaming traffic in OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) system. Streaming technique, widely developed and used in the internet to convey multimedia application (e.g., audio, video clip, etc.), is supposed to occupy a large share of bandwidth in future wireless systems (e.g. WiMAX, LTE ldquoLong Term Evolutionrdquo, etc.). The stringent QoS constraints of these services may be reached at the expense of the system capacity and therefore a trade off between Fairness and capacity should be achieved. The novel opportunistic scheduler proposed in this paper balances this trade off and allows thus OFDMA systems to handle streaming services without losing much cell capacity. Results afforded by this scheduler are promising and show that it outperforms the existing scheduling algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2008.4812849","publicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808202/4812823/04812849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2008.4812849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Time Scheduling for streaming services in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812849/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Time Scheduling for streaming services in OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560861","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812849/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Time Scheduling for streaming services in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569140265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065147S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808202","isNumber":"4812823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808202","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4812823","articleId":"4812849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4812868,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

We should first find the number of sources and then fairly track each of the detected networks. The extracted information of detected sources are used to update an internal model in the cognitive radio that helps it to predict and avoid frequencies in which active FHSS radios in the environment are simultaneously transmitting. In the proposed method, there is no need to have several antennas for DOA estimation and this will significantly reduce implementation cost and complexity of the algorithm. Due to real time nature of the problem, the simple structure of this method in comparison with other existing algorithms will make it preferable. We propose a method based on a probabilistic classifier to separate detected networks in sequential frames. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation and tracking of multiple frequency hopping signals for cognitive radio communications","publicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","doi":"10.1109/WD.2008.4812868","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 1st IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808202/4812823/04812868.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2008.4812868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4812868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4812868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation and tracking of multiple frequency hopping signals for cognitive radio communications","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4812868/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation and tracking of multiple frequency hopping signals for cognitive radio communications","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569140615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046609S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808202","isNumber":"4812823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808202","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4812823","articleId":"4812868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4812877,"authors":[{"name":"Hany R.

Incorporating interruptible loads in day-ahead markets could maximize their potential in providing ancillary services because it enables them to plan their operations, and for them to offer reliable curtailment capacities and competitive bids. This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization to schedule a set of interruptible loads over a 16-hour period. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total payments to the interruptible loads and the frequency of interruptions, and to satisfy the required hourly curtailments and operational constraints imposed by the interruptible loads. The constraints in this multi-objective optimization problem were handled using four constraint-handling methods: using static and adaptive penalty functions, tracking only feasible solutions, and using repair algorithms. The suitability of these constraint-handling approaches to the problem at hand were investigated and compared.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4807911/4812967/04813077.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispatch of interruptible loads using binary particle swarm optimization: A comparison of constraint-handling methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power system security","Constraint optimization","Job shop scheduling","Energy consumption","Dynamic programming","Cities and towns","Birds","Cost function","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load management","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interruptible loads","binary particle swarm optimization","constraint-handling methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dispatch of interruptible loads using binary particle swarm optimization: A comparison of constraint-handling methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571855","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispatch of interruptible loads using binary particle swarm optimization: A comparison of constraint-handling methods","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p196PID853591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060172S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4807911","isNumber":"4812967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4807911","xplore-issue":"4812967","articleId":"4813077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Univ of New South Wales","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813105,"authors":[{"name":"Sridhar R.

To address this drawback, switching state redundancy is required to evenly distribute the losses and can be achieved differently as the level of the converter changes. For instance, the three-level active NPC (3L-ANPC) converter has switching state redundancy and is derived from the 3L-NPC converter by adding an anti-parallel switch to the clamping diodes; in the 4L-ANPC converter, the combination of a 2L converter and a 3L-ANPC converter is used; in a 5L-ANPC converter, the combination of the 3L-ANPC and 3L-flying capacitor (FC) converter is advantageous. The paper discusses selective-harmonic-elimination (SHE) pulse-width-modulation (PWM) strategies for the above mentioned converters and explains how loss distribution can be achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching converters","Power semiconductor switches","Semiconductor diodes","Pulse width modulation converters","Semiconductor devices","Power generation","Switching frequency","Clamps","Capacitors","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SHE-PWM switching strategies","active neutral point clamped multilevel converters","switching state redundancy","anti-parallel switch","selective-harmonic-elimination pulse-width-modulation","three-level converter","four-level converter","five-level converter","floating capacitor converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Selective harmonic elimination","pulse-width modulation","neutral point clamped converter","active neutral point clamped converter","three-level converter","four-level converter","five-level converter","floating capacitor converter"]}],"publicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4807911/4812967/04813105.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SHE-PWM switching strategies for active neutral point clamped multilevel converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SHE-PWM switching strategies for active neutral point clamped multilevel converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813105/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813105/","accessionNumber":"10561096","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SHE-PWM switching strategies for active neutral point clamped multilevel converters","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p244PID845394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070862S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4807911","isNumber":"4812967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4807911","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4812967","articleId":"4813105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Univ of New South Wales","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4813111,"authors":[{"name":"Oguzhan Ceylan","affiliation":["Oguzhan Ceylan is with Informatics Institute, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Oguzhan","lastName":"Ceylan","id":"37085535369"},{"name":"Aydogan Ozdemir","affiliation":["Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Aydogan","lastName":"Ozdemir","id":"37339199000"},{"name":"Hasan Dag","affiliation":["Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Dag","id":"37403271500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7334-2715-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4162-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power system modeling","Load flow","Reactive power","Power system security","Power system analysis computing","Power system dynamics","Mathematical model","Power system simulation","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","particle swarm optimisation","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["branch outage solution","particle swarm optimization","outage MW line flows","voltage magnitude calculations","reactive power flow calculations","minimization method","linear system model implementation","IEEE 14 bus","IEEE 30 bus","IEEE 57 bus","AC load flow calculation"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/4807911/4812967/04813111.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Branch outage solution using particle swarm optimization","abstract":"For post outage MW line flows and voltage magnitude calculations most of the methods use linear methods because of their simplicity.

Several improved masking techniques for empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a local Hilbert transformer are proposed and a number of issues regarding their use and interpretation are identified. Simulated response data from a complex power system model are used to assess the efficacy of the proposed techniques for capturing the temporal evolution of critical system modes. It is shown that the combination of the proposed methods result in superior frequency and temporal resolution than other approaches for analyzing complicated nonstationary oscillations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4839059/04813184.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Refined Hilbert\u2013Huang Transform With Applications to Interarea Oscillation Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Power system analysis computing","Power system dynamics","Data mining","Power system harmonics","Frequency","Power system stability","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hilbert transforms","oscillations","power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["refined Hilbert-Huang transform","interarea oscillation monitoring","power systems transient response","masking techniques","empirical mode decomposition","local Hilbert transformer","power system model","critical system modes","nonstationary oscillation analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolution filter","empirical mode decomposition","Hilbert\u2013Huang transform","interarea oscillation","masking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Refined Hilbert\u2013Huang Transform With Applications to Interarea Oscillation Monitoring","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4813184/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587695","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Refined Hilbert\u2013Huang Transform With Applications to Interarea Oscillation Monitoring","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs02-dlaila-2016478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113551S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4839059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4839059","articleId":"4813184","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813188,"authors":[{"name":"Ruisheng Diao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ruisheng Diao (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

Timely and accurate assessment of voltage security is necessary to detect post-contingency voltage problems in order to prevent a large scale blackout. This paper presents an online voltage security assessment scheme using synchronized phasor measurements and periodically updated decision trees (DTs). The DTs are first trained offline using detailed voltage security analysis conducted using the past representative and forecasted 24-h ahead operating conditions. The DTs are also updated every hour by including newly predicted system conditions for robustness improvement. The associated synchronized critical attributes are obtained in real time from phasor measurement units (PMUs) and compared with the offline thresholds determined by the DTs to assess security. This approach is tested on the American Electric Power (AEP) system and properly trained DTs perform well in assessing voltage security.

Moreover, the population size is increased adaptively, the number of search intervals for the particles is selected adaptively and the particles search the decision space with accuracy up to two digit points resulting in the improved convergence of the process.

The key to this is a clever use of variable-depth shift registers which are efficiently implemented in Xilinx FPGAs in the form of shift register logic (SRL) components. Comparisons with the conventional architecture of FIR filter with symmetric boundary processing show considerable area saving especially with long-tap filters. For instance, our architecture implementation of the 8-tap low Daubechies-8 FIR filter achieves ~ 30% reduction in the area requirement (in terms of slices) compared to the conventional architecture while maintaining the same throughput. Two of the above-cited novel architectures are dedicated to the special case of symmetric FIR filters. The first architecture is highly area-efficient but requires a clock frequency doubler. While this reduces the overall processing speed (to a maximum of 2), it does maintain a high throughput. Moreover, this speed penalty is cancelled in bi-phase filters which are widely used in multirate architectures (e.g., wavelets). Our second symmetric FIR filter architecture saves less logic than the first architecture (e.g., 10% with the 9-tap low Biorthogonal 9&7 symmetric filter instead of 37% with the first architecture) but overcomes its speed penalty as it matches the throughput of the conventional architecture.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4839067/04813197.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Area-Efficient FPGA Architectures for FIR Filtering With Symmetric Signal Extension","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2016715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2016715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Area-Efficient FPGA Architectures for FIR Filtering With Symmetric Signal Extension","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587472","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4813197/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Area-Efficient FPGA Architectures for FIR Filtering With Symmetric Signal Extension","sourcePdf":"17tvlsi05-abenkrid-2016715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10611S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4839067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4839067","articleId":"4813197","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813198,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Swaroop Pappala","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Power Systems, Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4839059/4813198/4813198-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Venkata Swaroop Pappala received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Nagarjuna University, Nagarjuna, India, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (with emphasis on power and automation) in 2005 from the University Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include optimization under uncertainty using evolutionary algorithms."]},"firstName":"Venkata Swaroop","lastName":"Pappala","id":"37662374400"},{"name":"Istvan Erlich","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Power Systems, Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4839059/4813198/4813198-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Istvan Erlich (SM'06) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering in 1976 and the Ph.D. degree in 1983, both from the University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany, in 1976.","After his studies, he worked in Hungary in the field of electrical distribution networks.

In this paper, we present the development of a topology-based framework using a 3-D skeletal model for the robust detection and tracking of a vehicle occupant's head position from low-resolution range image data for a passive safety system. Unlike previous approaches to head detection, the proposed approach explores the topology information of a scene to detect the position of the head. Among the different available topology representations, the Reeb graph technique is chosen and is adapted to low-resolution 3-D range images. Invariance of the graph under rotations is achieved by using a Morse radial distance function. To cope with the particular challenges such as the noise and the large variations in the density of the data, a voxel neighborhood connectivity notion is proposed. A multiple-hypothesis tracker (MHT) with nearest-neighbor data association and Kalman filter prediction is applied on the endpoints of the Reeb graph to select and filter the correct head candidate out of Reeb graph endpoints. A systematic evaluation of the head detection framework is carried out on full-scale experimental 3-D range images and compared with the ground truth. It is shown that the Reeb graph topology algorithm developed herein allows the correct detection of the head of the occupant with only two head candidates as input to the MHT. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is robust under the large variations of the scene. The processing requirements of the proposed approach are discussed. It is shown that the number of operations is rather low and that real-time processing requirements can be met with the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04813203.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","startPage":"4064","endPage":"4077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D-Skeleton-Based Head Detection and Tracking Using Range Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-D-Skeleton-Based Head Detection and Tracking Using Range Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903025","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D-Skeleton-Based Head Detection and Tracking Using Range Images","sourcePdf":"tvt-devarakota-2020595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081288S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4813203","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813204,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279338600"},{"name":"Xin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403255600"},{"name":"Dazhuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dazhuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278440000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4813204","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":644},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Data models","Multiaccess communication","Parameter estimation","Transmitters","Multiple signal classification","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","blind source separation","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind DOA estimation","MC-CDMA","antenna array","direction-of-arrival estimation","multicarrier code-division multiple-access system","data model","multi-invariance property","multi-invariance estimation","rotational invariance technique","ESPRIT algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation","estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT)","multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA)","multi-invariance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) system with an antenna array.

However, the influence of dielectric properties and behavior on device performance in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is still poorly understood and a substantial contributor to device failure. The difference is primarily due to two factors. First, the characteristic length scale and electrical stress of dielectrics in MEMS are often an order of magnitude or more than in semiconductor devices. Lateral dimensions of tens of micrometers increase the probability of including defect sites, and higher applied voltages increase the probability of dielectric breakdown. Second, dielectrics in MEMS are often designed to fulfill multiple functions, often with no equivalent in semiconductor devices. The use of dielectrics as structural material puts substantial emphasis on material properties other than the classic dielectric properties. The use of freestanding elements in MEMS causes large interfacial surfaces between the dielectric and air which in turn provides various charge trap mechanisms. The same surfaces, when allowed to come in contact, could lead to a failure mechanism called stiction, where the surfaces cannot be separated after contact. This paper provides a review of the most prevalent failure mechanisms resulting from the use of dielectrics in electrostatically driven MEMS devices and methods to characterize both their material properties and impact on reliability performance.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2009.2020565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/5062529/04813209.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2009.2020565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062529","startPage":"190","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Device and Reliability Physics of Dielectrics in Electrostatically Driven MEMS Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Review of Device and Reliability Physics of Dielectrics in Electrostatically Driven MEMS Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712789","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Device and Reliability Physics of Dielectrics in Electrostatically Driven MEMS Devices","sourcePdf":"tdmr-degroot-2020565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161419S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"5062529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5062529","articleId":"4813209","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813214,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Nowicki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Cz\u0119stochowa University of Technology, Czestochowa, Poland","Department of Artificial Intelligence, Academy of Humanities and Economics in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Lodz, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5238715/4813214/4813214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Nowicki (M'07) was born in Czstochowa, Poland, in 1972.

Measurements are collected by the 183.3-GHz G-band vapor radiometer (GVR) operating at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program Climate Research Facility, Barrow, AK. The NN provides the means to explore the nonlinear regime of the measurements and investigate the physical boundaries of the operability of the instrument. A methodology to compute individual error bars associated with the NN output is developed, and a detailed error analysis of the network output is provided. Through the error analysis, it is possible to isolate several components contributing to the overall retrieval errors and to analyze the dependence of the errors on the inputs. The network outputs and associated errors are then compared with results from a physical retrieval and with the ARM two-channel microwave radiometer (MWR) statistical retrieval. When the NN is trained with a seasonal training data set, the retrievals of water vapor yield results that are comparable to those obtained from a traditional physical retrieval, with a retrieval error percentage of ~5% when the PWV is between 2 and 10 mm, but with the advantages that the NN algorithm does not require vertical profiles of temperature and humidity as input and is significantly faster computationally. Liquid water path (LWP) retrievals from the NN have a significantly improved clear-sky bias (mean of ~2.4 g/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) and a retrieval error varying from 1 to about 10 g/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n when the PWV amount is between 1 and 10 mm.

The dielectric constant of salt and water mixtures is usually high but can show large variations, depending on the considered salt. We confirmed values observed on the field with laboratory measurements and used these results to model both the amplitude and phase behaviors of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal at C- and L-bands. Our analytical simulations allow reproducing specific copolar signatures observed in both Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) and Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-C) data, corresponding to the saltpan of the Cottonball Basin. More precisely, the main objective of the present paper is to understand the influence of soil salinity as a function of soil moisture on the dielectric constant of soils and then on the backscattering coefficients recorded by airborne and spaceborne SAR systems. We also propose the copolarized backscattering ratio and phase difference as indicators of moistened and salt-affected soils. More precisely, we show that these copolar indicators should allow monitoring of the seasonal variations of the dielectric properties of saline deposits at both C- and L-bands. Because of the frequency dependence of the ionic conductivity, we also show that L-band SAR systems should be efficient tools for detecting both soil moisture and salinity, while C-band SAR systems are more suitable for the monitoring of soil moisture only. Through the study of terrestrial evaporitic environments by means of spaceborne SAR systems, our results could also be of great interest for defining future planetary missions, particularly for the exploration of Mars.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2014862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165149/04813241.pdf","startPage":"2581","endPage":"2598","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2014862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Hypersaline Deposits and Analysis of Their Signature in Airborne and Spaceborne SAR Data: Example of Death Valley, California","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Study of Hypersaline Deposits and Analysis of Their Signature in Airborne and Spaceborne SAR Data: Example of Death Valley, California","volume":"47","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4813241/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764051","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Hypersaline Deposits and Analysis of Their Signature in Airborne and Spaceborne SAR Data: Example of Death Valley, California","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lasne-2014862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125938S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5165149","articleId":"4813241","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4813244,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastien Simoens","affiliation":["Thales Avionics, Valence, France","Motorola Laboratories Paris, Parc Les Algor\u00edthmes, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Simoens","id":"37265711000"},{"name":"Olga Munoz-Medina","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Munoz-Medina","id":"38270745200"},{"name":"Josep Vidal","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37273645500"},{"name":"Aitor del Coso","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Aitor","lastName":"del Coso","id":"37295875200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4813244","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of source and relay transmit covariance optimization on the Gaussian MIMO relay channel with full channel state information (CSI), i.e., assuming perfect knowledge of all channels. For full-duplex relaying, we show that the cut-set bound on capacity can be computed as the solution of a convex problem, thus providing a tighter bound than previously published. For time division duplex (TDD) relaying, both upper and lower bounds on capacity are derived, and the transmit covariance matrices are optimized for decode-and-forward (DF) strategies with either partial or full decoding at the relay. A generic procedure is introduced to formulate these problems into a standard convex form, and to solve them efficiently. Suboptimum precoders are also proposed which have a specific matrix structure that either leads to a closed-form expression or at least reduces the dimension of the optimization problem. Practical aspects related to transmit power constraints and CSI availability are then discussed. Finally, simulations in a cellular downlink scenario show that the partial DF strategy can achieve a rate very close to capacity for realistic values of the source to relay SNR, and that the rate loss due to suboptimum precoder structures remains small for typical antenna configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04813244.pdf","startPage":"3588","endPage":"3599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2020744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2020744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Gaussian MIMO Relay Channel With Full Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Channel state information","Decoding","Covariance matrix","Channel capacity","Closed-form solution","Downlink","Standardization","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian MIMO relay channel","full channel state information","source transmit covariance optimization","relay transmit covariance optimization","full-duplex relaying","time division duplex relaying","decode-and-forward strategies","partial decoding","suboptimum precoders","closed-form expression","typical antenna configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative","relay","channel state information (CSI)","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Gaussian MIMO Relay Channel With Full Channel State Information","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4813244/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816657","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Gaussian MIMO Relay Channel With Full Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-ssimoens-2020744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08317S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"60","articleId":"4813244","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813246,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Gunther","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5165248/4813246/4813246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jake Gunther (S'91\u2013M'95) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, UT, in 1994, 1994, and 1998, respectively.","From 1992 to 1994, he was a Research Assistant with the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing Laboratory, BYU.

The S-curves for the PEDs are used as a tool to gain insight into the behavior of the new PEDs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2020746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5165248/04813246.pdf","startPage":"3101","endPage":"3107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2020746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Symbol Error Rate Carrier Phase Recovery of QPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813246/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Symbol Error Rate Carrier Phase Recovery of QPSK","volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764097","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813246/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Symbol Error Rate Carrier Phase Recovery of QPSK","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-jgunther-2020746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060815S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5165248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5165248","articleId":"4813246","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813252,"authors":[{"name":"Mihailo Stojnic","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5165248/4813252/4813252-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mihailo Stojnic received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.

The new wavelet transform can attain higher Q-factors (desirable for processing oscillatory signals) or the same low Q-factor of the dyadic wavelet transform.

By maximizing an upper bound of the sum capacity, we propose a scheduling scheme that requires only scalar feedback from each receiving user. To simplify user information feedback and better exploit the spatial channel correlation, we further develop a more efficient scheduling method that only requires a 1-bit indicator from each user and selects users based on the MIMO channel correlation information. Additionally, we then extend the proposed scheduling schemes for the system with imperfect (finite-rate) channel information feedback. Numerical results finally show that the proposed scheduling schemes can effectively improve the system sum capacity performance by exploiting the statistic channel-correlation information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Broadcasting","MIMO","Mobile communication","Array signal processing","Laboratories","Upper bound","Statistics","Space technology","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","correlation methods","feedback","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback multiuser scheduling","spatially correlated broadcast channels","transmission scheduling","multiple-input-multiple-output channels","user information feedback","spatial channel correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-rate feedback (FRF)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BCs)","multiuser scheduling","spatial correlation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04813260.pdf","startPage":"4406","endPage":"4418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback Multiuser Scheduling of Spatially Correlated Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback Multiuser Scheduling of Spatially Correlated Broadcast Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813260/","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813260/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10903031","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback Multiuser Scheduling of Spatially Correlated Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2020725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108158S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4813260","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4813261,"authors":[{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, Department of Mathematics and Informatics, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Mallorca, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4813261/4813261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guillem Femenias (M'91) was born in Petra, Spain, in 1963.

Most previous works rely on first-order amplitude-based finite-state Markov chains (AFSMCs) to model the physical layer. It is shown that these models present several deficiencies that could compromise the design of higher layer protocols. Thus, a physical-layer first-order 2-D Markov model using both the amplitude and the rate of change of the fading envelope is presented. Based on this multidimensional physical-layer Markov model, the quality-of-service (QoS) performance at the data-link layer is investigated through the use of two different approaches. The first one relies on an analytical framework based on a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) that jointly describes the statistical behavior of the arrival process, the queueing system, and the physical layer. The second one is based on the effective-bandwidth and effective-capacity theories. Both the DTMC-based and the effective-bandwidth/capacity-based approaches are analyzed and compared in combination with our proposed physical-layer first-order 2-D Markov model in a cross-layer design aiming to satisfy the required average packet loss probability constraint by maximizing the average throughput of the system. Numerical results show that our proposed framework represents a significant improvement over previous models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04813261.pdf","startPage":"4193","endPage":"4203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Two-Dimensional Markov Models and the Effective-Capacity Approach for Cross-Layer Design in AMC/ARQ-Based Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Wireless networks","Physical layer","Automatic repeat request","Adaptive systems","Modulation coding","Wireless application protocol","Fading","Multidimensional systems","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","automatic repeat request","computer networks","Markov processes","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D Markov model","effective capacity","cross layer design","AMC/ARQ based wireless networks","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","physical layer","automatic repeat request protocol","data link layer","finite state Markov chain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)","automatic repeat request (ARQ)","cross-layer design","effective capacity","Markov models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using Two-Dimensional Markov Models and the Effective-Capacity Approach for Cross-Layer Design in AMC/ARQ-Based Wireless Networks","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4813261/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903033","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Two-Dimensional Markov Models and the Effective-Capacity Approach for Cross-Layer Design in AMC/ARQ-Based Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-femenias-2020723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09733S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4813261","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813262,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4813262/4813262-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Sun (S'08) received the Bachelor's degree in information engineering and the M.S. degree in communication and information system from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

PV systems are sometimes subject to partial shading, which may produce a nonideal characteristic curve, presenting true and local power maxima in the P -I curve. Traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms can converge to local maximum, which is not the true MPP. In order to solve the problem, this paper investigates the effects of nonuniform solar irradiance distribution on a PV source. An MPPT algorithm that is able to optimize the source instantaneous operating power under nonuniform irradiance is proposed. The ability of the algorithm and its increased performance with respect to traditional algorithms are evaluated by means of experimental tests performed on a real PV power system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2019570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/04813267.pdf","startPage":"4374","endPage":"4380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2019570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Performance of MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Sources Subject to Inhomogeneous Insolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813267/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Performance of MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Sources Subject to Inhomogeneous Insolation","volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10916327","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813267/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Performance of MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Sources Subject to Inhomogeneous Insolation","sourcePdf":"tie-piegari-2019570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105568S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"4813267","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813268,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Xin Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4813268/4813268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Xin Liao received the M.S. degree in engineering from Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China, in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2006.","Since 1994, she has been with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, where she is currently a Full Professor.

Next, a decoupling strategy in combination with a fuzzy NN is used to control the zone temperatures. The architecture of the controller is based on a fuzzy c-means clustering approach; and the weights are optimized by a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm, which integrates the global optimization of density-based selection and the precise search of clonal expansion in an immune system with the fast local search of particle swarm optimization. HPSO is also used to optimize the zone temperature settings to minimize three items: fuel consumption, the temperature gradient within a billet, and the error between the mean and target temperatures of a billet at the furnace exit. The results of actual runs demonstrate the validity of this method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2019753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04813268.pdf","startPage":"2704","endPage":"2714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2019753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Hybrid-PSO and Fuzzy-NN Decoupling Control for Temperature of Reheating Furnace","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813268/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Hybrid-PSO and Fuzzy-NN Decoupling Control for Temperature of Reheating Furnace","volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736264","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813268/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Hybrid-PSO and Fuzzy-NN Decoupling Control for Temperature of Reheating Furnace","sourcePdf":"tie-liao-2019753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127035S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4813268","onlineDate":"10 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4813269,"authors":[{"name":"Benoit Gosselin","affiliation":["Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/5200715/4813269/4813269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benoit Gosselin (S'02) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2001.

We try to devise a strategy to tackle the problem of recognizing faces from images exhibiting strong pose (rotation and occlusion) and without prior knowledge (uncalibrated cameras, images from different sources). We do so by framing the recognition in the context of 3D structure from motion with missing data problems. In fact, recently, there has been a strong trend towards using 3D information to verify and recognize faces. However most of the state of the art works are developed over 3D sensors (3D range finders, stereo).Here we propose to do recognition by measuring the likelihood that one or more images were generated by a given 3D shape. In other words, given the subject's 3D shape, we compute the required transformation to match the probe images and measure its deviation from rigidity. This process is not straightforward due to the strong pose: face points are not visible in all images so there is a ldquomissing datardquo problem intrinsic to the formulation. One key assumption is that all images (and shape) correspond to neutral expression. Though limited in scale due to lack of large databases, a set of tests demonstrate the adequacy and good performance of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face recognition from multiple images: A shape-from-motion approach","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813303","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813303.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"3D face recognition from multiple images: A shape-from-motion approach","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813303/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571749","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face recognition from multiple images: A shape-from-motion approach","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055839S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813310,"authors":[{"name":"Ajmal Mian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Western Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Ajmal","lastName":"Mian","id":"37283914600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2153-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2154-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813310","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unsupervised learning","Face recognition","Clustering algorithms","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Feature extraction","Data mining","Robustness","Large-scale systems","Video sequences","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image sequences","unsupervised learning","video signal processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised learning","video-based face recognition","spatiotemporal information","video sequence","voting-based algorithm","video frames","video database"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to video-based face recognition that does not make any assumptions about the pose, expressions or prior localization of landmarks on the faces. The proposed algorithm exploits spatiotemporal information obtained from local features that are extracted from arbitrary keypoints on faces as opposed to pre-defined landmarks. The algorithm is inherently robust to large scale occlusions as it relies on local features. During unsupervised learning, faces from a video sequence are automatically clustered based on the similarity of their local features and a voting-based algorithm is employed to pick the representative features of each cluster. During recognition, video frames of a probe are sequentially matched to the clusters of all individuals in the gallery and its identity is decided on the basis of best temporally cohesive cluster matches. The proposed algorithms can also detect sudden identity changes in video by utilizing the temporal dimension. The algorithm was tested on the Honda/UCSD video database and a maximum of 99.5% recognition rate was achieved.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813310","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813310.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised learning from local features for video-based face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813310/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised learning from local features for video-based face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560970","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813310/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised learning from local features for video-based face recognition","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03948S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813318,"authors":[{"name":"Alice J.

The results indicate that: (1.) machines can compete quantitatively with humans matching face identity across changes in illumination; (2.) qualitative differences between humans and machines can be exploited to improve identification by fusing human and machine match scores; and (3.) recognition skills for humans and machines are comparably stable across changes in image quality.

Firstly, we develop a shape transformation model that is formulated as a physically-based parametric muscle model that captures the subtle deformations facial features undergo with age. The model implicitly accounts for the physical properties and geometric orientations of the individual facial muscles. Next, we develop an image gradient based texture transformation function that characterizes facial wrinkles and other skin artifacts often observed during different ages. Facial growth statistics (both in terms of shape and texture) play a crucial role in developing the aforementioned transformation models. From a database that comprises of pairs of age separated face images of many individuals, we extract age-based facial measurements across key fiducial features and further, study textural variations across ages. We present experimental results that illustrate the applications of the proposed facial aging model in tasks such as face recognition and facial appearance prediction across aging.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813337","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813337.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling shape and textural variations in aging faces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813337/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling shape and textural variations in aging faces","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10560985","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813337/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling shape and textural variations in aging faces","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052837S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813349,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Lanitis","affiliation":["Department of Multimedia and Graphic Arts, Cyprus University of Technology, Lemesos, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Lanitis","id":"37325951900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2153-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2154-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813349","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813349","abstract":"An important aspect related to the development of face-aging algorithms is the evaluation of the ability of such algorithms to produce accurate age-progressed faces.

CCA maximizes the correlation between two linear subspaces associated with image-sets, where an image-set is assumed to contain multiple images of a person's face. When these linear subspaces are viewed as points on a Grassmann manifold, then geodesic distance on the manifold becomes the natural way to compare image-sets. The proposed method is tested on the ORL data set where it achieves a rank one identification rate of 98.75%. The proposed method is also tested on a subset of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge Experiment 4 data. Specifically, 82 probe and 230 gallery subjects with 32 images per probe and gallery image-set. Our algorithm achieves a rank one identification rate of 87% and a verification rate of 81% at a false accept rate of 1/1;000. These results on FRGC are significantly better than the well-known image-set matching algorithm, Mutual Subspace Method (MSM), which does not use geodesic distance. Another important finding is that cohort normalization boosts verification performance by 50% when used in conjunction with image-set matching. These results suggest that excellent levels of face recognition performance are possible when using image-sets, geodesic distance and cohort normalization. Finally, the proposed approach is generic in the sense that no training is required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image-set matching using a geodesic distance and cohort normalization","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813365","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813365.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image-set matching using a geodesic distance and cohort normalization","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813365/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571775","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image-set matching using a geodesic distance and cohort normalization","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098498S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813376,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Amberg","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Amberg","id":"37829211300"},{"name":"Reinhard Knothe","firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Knothe","id":"38094479900"},{"name":"Thomas Vetter","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Vetter","id":"37281818300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2153-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2154-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813376","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Shape","Probes","Surface fitting","Databases","Image recognition","Lighting","Testing","Noise robustness","Iterative closest point algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image retrieval","iterative methods","mathematical morphology","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expression invariant 3D face recognition","morphable model","shape recognition","robust nonrigid ICP algorithm","image retrieval","fitting algorithm","iterative closest point"]}],"abstract":"We describe an expression-invariant method for face recognition by fitting an identity/expression separated 3D Morphable Model to shape data.

Using 2D face image as probe and 3D face data as gallery is an alternative method to deal with computation complexity, expensive equipment and fussy pretreatment in 3D face recognition systems. In this paper we propose a learning based 2D-3D face matching method using the CCA to learn the mapping between 2D face image and 3D face data. This method makes it possible to match the on-site 2D face image with enrolled 3D face data. Our 2D-3D face matching method decreased the computation complexity drastically compared to the conventional 3D-3D face matching while keeping relative high recognition rate. Furthermore, to simplify the mapping between 2D face image and 3D face data, a patch based strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of matching. And the kernel method is also evaluated to reveal the non-linear relationship. The experiment results show that CCA based method has good performance and patch based method has significant improvement compared to the holistic method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D\u20133D face matching using CCA","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813407","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813407.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"2D\u20133D face matching using CCA","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813407/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571801","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D\u20133D face matching using CCA","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049359S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4813408,"authors":[{"name":"Unsang Park","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Unsang","lastName":"Park","id":"37400212000"},{"name":"Yiying Tong","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yiying","lastName":"Tong","id":"38103584500"},{"name":"Anil K.

Aging is a complex process that affects both the 3D shape of the face and its texture (e.g., wrinkles). While the facial age modeling has been widely studied in computer graphics community, only a few studies have been reported in computer vision literature on age-invariant face recognition. We propose an automatic aging simulation technique that can assist any existing face recognition engine for aging-invariant face recognition. We learn the aging patterns of shape and the corresponding texture in 3D domain by adapting a 3D morphable model to the 2D aging database (public domain FG-NET). At recognition time, each probe and all gallery images are modified to compensate for the age-induced variation using an intermediate 3D model deformation and a texture modification, prior to matching. The proposed approach is evaluated on a set of age-separated probe and gallery data using a state-of-the-art commercial face recognition engine, FaceVACS. Use of 3D aging model improves the rank-1 matching accuracy on FG-NET database from 28.0% to 37.8%, on average.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813408.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition with temporal invariance: A 3D aging model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Aging","Shape","Engines","Probes","Face detection","Computer graphics","Computer vision","Computational modeling","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","image matching","image morphing","image texture","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["age-invariant face recognition","temporal invariance","3D facial age modeling","image matching","computer graphics","computer vision","3D morphable model deformation","2D aging database","texture modification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition with temporal invariance: A 3D aging model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813408/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571802","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition with temporal invariance: A 3D aging model","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074224S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813410,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Jia","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Jia","id":"37287275100"},{"name":"Aleix M.

Several solutions to this problem have been proposed over the years - ranging from dividing the face image into a set of local regions to sophisticated statistical methods. In the present paper, we pose the problem as a reconstruction one. In this approach, each test image is described as a linear combination of the training samples in each class. The class samples providing the best reconstruction determine the class label. Here, ldquobest reconstructionrdquo means that reconstruction providing the smallest matching error when using an appropriate metric to compare the reconstructed and test images. A key point in our formulation is to base this reconstruction solely on the visible data in the training and testing sets. This allows to have partial occlusions in both the training and testing samples, while previous methods only dealt with occlusions in the testing set. We show extensive experimental results using a large variety of comparative studies, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over the state of the art.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813410.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition with occlusions in the training and testing sets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Testing","Image reconstruction","Statistical analysis","State estimation","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","face recognition","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","occlusions","matching error","image reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition with occlusions in the training and testing sets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561017","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition with occlusions in the training and testing sets","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072431S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813416,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Han","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Han","id":"37087327904"},{"name":"Wei Liang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Liang","id":"37087493500"},{"name":"Xinxiao Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xinxiao Wu","id":"37087492821"},{"name":"Yunde Jia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yunde Jia","id":"37087199444"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2153-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2154-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813416","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Biological system modeling","Legged locomotion","Space technology","Joints","Pattern recognition","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Motion estimation","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image classification","image motion analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human action recognition","hierarchical manifold space learning","hierarchical nonlinear dimensionality reduction","feature extraction","cascade discriminative model based action modeling","high-dimensional human pose space","hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model","conditional random field","motion pattern set","image classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813416","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813416.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human action recognition using discriminative models in the learned hierarchical manifold space","abstract":"A hierarchical learning based approach for human action recognition is proposed in this paper.

We explore the underlying hierarchical structures of high-dimensional human pose space using hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model (HGPLVM) and learn a representative motion pattern set for each body part. In the hierarchical manifold space, the bottom-up cascade conditional random fields (CRFs) are used to predict the corresponding motion pattern in each manifold subspace, and then the final action label is estimated for each observation by a discriminative classifier on the current motion pattern set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4813416/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571807","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Human action recognition using discriminative models in the learned hierarchical manifold space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human action recognition using discriminative models in the learned hierarchical manifold space","confLoc":"Amsterdam","sourcePdf":"211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069797S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4813417,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Information and Communications University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Young Choi","id":"37405970500"},{"name":"Yong Man Ro","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Information and Communications University, South Korea","The Edward S Rogers Sr Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"lastName":"Yong Man Ro","id":"37302252100"},{"name":"Konstantinos N.

In most practical FR applications, it is reasonable to assume that the face resolution used during training is higher than the resolution used during the identification or verification process. This dimensional mismatch negatively impacts the performance of the traditional subspace recognition solutions. To address resolution mismatch problem, this paper introduces a novel estimation method capable of determining feature subspace of the lower resolution probe given an eigenspace pre-trained with higher resolution facial images.

Very recently, a learning based face recognition system is also seen to be applied to Web platform combining face recognition and Web service. However, many existing methods which focused on recognition accuracy cannot cope with the new social network platform because the adopted static learning approach is not adaptive to daily updated photographs among the massive number of users. In this paper, we discuss the difference between a stand-alone based system and a social network based system and propose a new collaborative face recognition framework where a redundant tagging can be avoided via sharing the identification information for efficient update under the social network platform. Our Experiments (including a Web stress test) using a public database show that the proposed method records a better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art classifier SVM adopting a polynomial kernel and has fast execution time for both training and testing.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813420","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810099/4813301/04813420.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A collaborative face recognition framework on a social network platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813420/","displayDocTitle":"A collaborative face recognition framework on a social network platform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571810","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813420/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A collaborative face recognition framework on a social network platform","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113184S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810099","isNumber":"4813301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810099","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4813301","articleId":"4813420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813450,"authors":[{"name":"Jeroen Lichtenauer","affiliation":["Information & Communication Theory Group Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Lichtenauer","id":"37269336000"},{"name":"Emile Hendriks","affiliation":["Information & Communication Theory Group Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Emile","lastName":"Hendriks","id":"37270169100"},{"name":"Marcel Reinders","affiliation":["Information & Communication Theory Group Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Reinders","id":"37270916300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2153-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2154-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813450","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813450","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handicapped aids","Knowledge transfer","Hidden Markov models","Machine learning","Mathematics","Computer science","Information resources","History","Performance evaluation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","image classification","object recognition","time warp simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sign language classifier","sign language tutor","classification model","dynamic time warping","sign language recognition method"]}],"abstract":"We present a method to automatically construct a sign language classifier for a previously unseen sign.

It is inspired by Wong's public key watermarking scheme proposed in 1998 and aims to improve its vulnerability towards possible attacks indicated by Barreto and Holliman. Instead of making use of contextual information and making it an inter-block dependent scheme, as suggested by Barreto, we adopt another approach to retain its blockwise independent property. Our scheme can avoid the conditions necessary for such attacks to be feasible. Furthermore, our scheme extracts the inherent image features and embed them into this image as the watermark.

However, BF algorithms have the disadvantages of poorer performances and higher iteration counts than MSA. To increase the BF performances, this paper presents a novel BF algorithm, called Low-Correlation Multibit-flipping (LCMBF) algorithm, which flips more than one bit in each iteration. High performances are achieved by flipping those bits with low correlation as much as possible. As such, the chances of introducing additional error bits are greatly reduced. Overall, the proposed algorithm achieves better BER performances and requires less iteration numbers than conventional BF algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813653","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813653.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective multibit-flipping algorithm for LDPC decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An effective multibit-flipping algorithm for LDPC decoding","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813653/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813653/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective multibit-flipping algorithm for LDPC decoding","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048954S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813654,"authors":[{"name":"Wagner Okano","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL-PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Wagner","lastName":"Okano","id":"37402975400"},{"name":"Fernando Ciriaco","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL-PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Ciriaco","id":"37299832100"},{"name":"Taufik Abrao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL-PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Taufik","lastName":"Abrao","id":"37270219700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813654","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"abstract":"This work proposes a general equation for the channel reliability (L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n) of DS/CDMA turbo coding systems under fading Rayleigh channels and multiple access interference.

The design stresses initial signal detection using the wireless network array.

Of specific concern in network operations will be conservation of energy costs while providing an operable array for target signal detection and follow-on processing. Using the Neyman-Pearson criterion, a desired aperture can be determined providing an optimal probability of detection against an acceptable false alarm rate. Control of these parameters will be based on usage of the distributed wireless sensor nodes. The sensor nodes will be segmented into sub-arrays to produce the desired aperture. Upon signal detection, the network may then further optimize the aperture for purposes of increasing signal to noise ratio in signal processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813657","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing probability of detection in a wireless sensor network radio frequency array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing probability of detection in a wireless sensor network radio frequency array","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813657/","accessionNumber":"10586960","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813657/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing probability of detection in a wireless sensor network radio frequency array","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03766S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4813659,"authors":[{"name":"Jiun-Ying Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-Ying Wu","id":"38189594900"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Rong Wu","id":"37280430600"},{"name":"Nan-Chiun Lien","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Nan-Chiun Lien","id":"38186173300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813659","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Detectors","Computational complexity","Throughput","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood detection","Receiving antennas","Hardware","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO detection","ML-like detection algorithm","maximum-likelihood detection","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","computational complexity","sphere decoding detector","SD detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection","Sphere Decoding","ML decoding","V-BLAST","Low-complexity algorithm"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems requires high computational complexity. As a result, many suboptimal algorithms, achieving a tradeoff between computational complexity and performance, have been proposed. Among these algorithms, the sphere decoding (SD) detector is considered as a very efficient solution. However, the throughput of the SD is not constant and it greatly depends on for channel conditions. In general, the variation of the throughput is very large. As a result, its hardware implementation can be difficult or inefficient. In this paper, a low-complexity ML-like detection algorithm is proposed. While the proposed algorithm has a constant throughput, it can be computationally more efficient than the SD detection. The other advantage that the SD decoder doesn't have is that the proposed algorithm allows an easy tradeoff between complexity and performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813659","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity MIMO detection using a list projection technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity MIMO detection using a list projection technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813659/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561150","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity MIMO detection using a list projection technique","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055604S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4813660,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Vieira","affiliation":["DEETC, Lisbon Polytechnic Institute (ISEL), Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Vieira","id":"37429301600"},{"name":"Paula Queluz","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es / IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paula","lastName":"Queluz","id":"37294883100"},{"name":"Antonio Rodrigues","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es / IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37270186100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813660","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","3G mobile communication","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Modulation coding","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Telecommunications","Long Term Evolution","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","MIMO communication","mobile communication","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE","long term evolution","spectral efficiency","spatial multiplexing","MIMO","macro cells","capacity enhancement","universal mobile telecommunication system","system bandwidth","signal-to-noise ratio","adaptive modulation and coding","modulation and coding set","single input single output"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Communications","MIMO","LTE","Spectral Efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) capacity enhancement considering the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, in the downlink, including the effects of system bandwidth and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) efficiency.

We also consider that the base station (BS) broadcasts the signals to multiple distributed users via two relay nodes, that is, three hops, using a zero-forcing dirty paper coding (DPC). We propose three different relaying strategies depending on adopting the power loading from the antennas of each reay node. We calculate both the lower and the upper bounds of the sum capacity of the different relaying strategies we proposed and compare these lower and upper bounds with the sum capacity of the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol based system. In our paper we derive the optimal power allocation at both relay nodes and the BS by using the geometric programming. The simulation results show that our proposed relaying strategies can achieve a similar sum capacity with the upper bound of the three-hop multiuser MIM relaying system, and these outperform the two-hop multiuser MIMO relaying system porposed in Chae et al. (2008) or the multiuser MIMO system without relays in terms of the sum capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813661","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-hop MIMO relaying systems in Gaussian broadcast channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-hop MIMO relaying systems in Gaussian broadcast channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813661/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586961","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-hop MIMO relaying systems in Gaussian broadcast channels","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P009s.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102067S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813662,"authors":[{"name":"Khanh Tran Gia","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Khanh Tran","lastName":"Gia","id":"37391758100"},{"name":"Kei Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37266412100"},{"name":"Fumie Ono","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumie","lastName":"Ono","id":"37269248700"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyomichi","lastName":"Araki","id":"37270249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813662","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Network coding","Mesh networks","Frequency","Network topology","Wireless mesh networks","Interchannel interference","Interference suppression","Spread spectrum communication","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","encoding","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two dimensional MIMO network coding","one dimensional topology","wireless mesh network","cochannel interference cancellation","end-to-end network capacity","distance nodes","2D mesh network","cooperative nulling algorithm","interference signals"]}],"abstract":"A combination of MIMO and network coding for one dimensional (1D) topology in wireless mesh network has been proposed in recent literature. The technique supplies higher network capacity compared to that of conventional schemes. In this paper, the authors extend MIMO network coding to two dimensional (2D) topology. Owing to the efficient sharing of frequency of network coding and co-channel interference cancellation ability of MIMO, the proposed technique provides a significant gain to end-to-end network capacity. Furthermore, in a 2D mesh network where interferences from long distance nodes cannot be ignored, the authors proposed cooperative nulling algorithm by which interference signals can be suppressed.

However, to fully exploit the physical layer gain, upper layer protocols need to be adjusted appropriately. This paper investigates the significance of transmission control from the media access control (MAC) layer point of view by comparing the performance of the slotted ALOHA with spatial multiplexing (SM) in two scenarios; one with and the other one without the controlled probability of transmissions. It is also shown that the maximum average throughput (frames/slot) does not translate into the highest success rate. The analysis provides a useful insight into the cross-layer design that takes into account MIMO spatial multiplexing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813671.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of probability of transmission on slotted ALOHA for wireless networks employing MIMO spatial multiplexing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","MIMO","Data communication","Scattering","Costs","Radio spectrum management","Physical layer","Access protocols","Communication system control","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","probability","radio networks","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","slotted ALOHA","wireless networks","MIMO spatial multiplexing techniques","multiple-input-multiple-output system","data transmission rate","upper layer protocols","transmission control","media access control layer","spatial multiplexing","cross-layer design","data transmission","MAC layer point"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","spatial multiplexing","MAC protocol","slotted ALOHA","probability of transmission","collision","capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of probability of transmission on slotted ALOHA for wireless networks employing MIMO spatial multiplexing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813671/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586970","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of probability of transmission on slotted ALOHA for wireless networks employing MIMO spatial multiplexing","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040381S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813674,"authors":[{"name":"H.L.

By this network, the perceived video quality can be evaluated based on the heuristic function of TCP throughput which is dependent of the user's mobility (Doppler frequency) over a Rayleigh fading channel.

Fundamental to the operation of a CR is the sensing of legacy communication. Energy detector (ED) is a simple and effective signal sensing method. However, the ED requires accurate estimation of the noise power. Any error in the estimation, which is common in practice, affects its performance. Communication signals have temporal correlation due to multipath fading. In this study, we sense a signal by looking at the correlation property. To ensure the correlation we use a simple technique to synthetically introduce multipaths. Thus the need for the estimation of the noise power is avoided. The strength of the correlation is measured using Pearson product moment correlation test. The synthetic multipath scheme is discussed, together with several simulation results, and comparison with the energy detector.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813685.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal sensing for cognitive radios using synthetic multipath","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4813685/","displayDocTitle":"Signal sensing for cognitive radios using synthetic multipath","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586979","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal sensing for cognitive radios using synthetic multipath","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054965S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813696,"authors":[{"name":"Eva Peiker","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Peiker","id":"38188322600"},{"name":"Jan Dominicus","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Dominicus","id":"38188321900"},{"name":"Werner G.

Furthermore, so as to avoid the complex-valued computation in QPSK formats, the optimization is reformulated as a real-valued problem (also feasible for high-order modulations). Performance is evaluated considering the bit error rate (BER) criterium in order to assure that the proposed algorithm is efficient in accomplishing a good sub-optimum performance, with a relatively low computational complexity. A detailed computational complexity analysis is taken into account, aspiring future implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813698.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified local search multiuser detection for QPSK S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Quadrature phase shift keying","MIMO","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Receiving antennas","Computational complexity","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum local search multiuser detection","QPSK","SIMO MC-CDMA system","MIMO multicarrier code division multiple access","quadrature phase shift keying modulation","single-input multiple-output system","multiple-input multiple-output system","complex-valued computation","high-order modulation","bit error rate","BER","sub-optimum performance","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simplified local search multiuser detection for QPSK S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813698/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586985","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified local search multiuser detection for QPSK S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092302S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813699,"authors":[{"name":"Chengkang Pan","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Chengkang Pan","id":"37292691000"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yueming Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Youyun Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813699","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Channel estimation","Physical layer","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Signal detection","Space technology","Cross layer design","Source separation","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space sensing based random access","SIMO-OFDM systems","cross-layer medium access control","channel estimation","packets transmission period","orthogonal training sequences","access point","amplify-and-forward form","multiple nonoverlapping pilot subslot","multipacket reception model","throughput performance","MIMO-OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"The problem of cross-layer medium access control (MAC) in a SIMO-OFDM system is addressed and a space sensing based random access (SSRA) scheme is proposed. In SSRA scheme, the transmit slot is divided into three parts: space sensing period, channel estimation period and packets transmission period. Without orthogonal training sequences, users can sense the possible spatial collisions in the following way. Each user sends a short random sequence to the access point (AP) and the AP forwards the receive signal to the users with an amplify-and-forward form. Each user detects the receive signal to determine whether a collision in packets transmission period will appear. After space sensing, the user sensing no collision sends a common training sequence to AP for channel estimation. Multiple nonoverlapping pilot subslots are set and the user randomly selects one for training sequence transmission. Failing channel estimation means failing packet reception. Thus, SSRA gives a more practical multipacket reception (MPR) model. The throughput performance of the proposed SSRA scheme is analyzed analytically and evaluated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813699","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space sensing based random access in SIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space sensing based random access in SIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813699/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561164","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space sensing based random access in SIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089406S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813701,"authors":[{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Youyun Xu","id":"37277724400"},{"name":"Jinwang Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jinwang Zhao","id":"37879378900"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yueming Cai","id":"37290653400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813701","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"abstract":"For multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channels, the base station (BS) requires all channel state information (CSI) to select the best user set to achieve multiuser diversity gain. Unfortunately, CSI at the BS have to be fed back from all users for most of systems, especially for the frequency division duplexed (FDD) systems, which imposes a heavy and demanding burden on the feedback channels. Furthermore, more user channel coefficient can result in higher computational complexity for scheduling at the BS. Motivated by these problems, we proposed an improved user selection scheme which sets feedback threshold value based on some existent user selection algorithms. Numerical studies show that the proposed scheme reduces numerous feedback load and computational complexity. However, setting feedback threshold may also incur some loss in sum rate. While simulation results show that if only a proper threshold value is considered the proposed scheme can obtain significant benefits in feedback load and complexity at a cost of little loss in sum rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User selection based on feedback threshold for MIMO broadcast channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","MIMO","Broadcasting","Computational complexity","Downlink","Base stations","Channel state information","Diversity methods","Frequency conversion","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel allocation","computational complexity","diversity reception","feedback","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user selection algorithm","feedback channels","multiuser MIMO broadcast channels","multiple-input multiple-output downlink channels","base station","channel state information","multiuser diversity gain","frequency division duplexed systems","user channel coefficient","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"User selection based on feedback threshold for MIMO broadcast channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813701/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561166","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User selection based on feedback threshold for MIMO broadcast channels","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047109S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813706,"authors":[{"name":"Rohaida Ahmad Azra'ai","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology MARA, (UiTM), Shah Alam, Selangor DE, MALAYSIA"],"firstName":"Rohaida Ahmad","lastName":"Azra'ai","id":"37085914834"},{"name":"Mohd Nasir bin Taib","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology MARA, (UiTM), Shah Alam, Selangor DE, MALAYSIA"],"firstName":"Mohd Nasir bin","lastName":"Taib","id":"37322448400"},{"name":"Nooritawati Md Tahir","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology MARA, (UiTM), Shah Alam, Selangor DE, MALAYSIA"],"firstName":"Nooritawati Md","lastName":"Tahir","id":"37315644200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Heart valves","Cardiac disease","Blood flow","Arteries","Acoustic testing","Humans","Muscles","Myocardium","Lungs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","digital filters","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","heart problem identification","heart sound","sound classification","digital filter","sliding window approach","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Classification","Heart Sound","Heart Disease"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813706","abstract":"This paper demonstrated a technique to identify heart problem based on heart sound using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Simulation results show that scheduling schemes that perform well in the physical layer do not always have the same results when considering the characteristic of the upper layers, and in both different scenarios proportional fairness scheduling algorithm can get a good tradeoff between system throughput and user fairness.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813724","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparision of packet scheduling algorithms for OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparision of packet scheduling algorithms for OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813724/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561181","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813724/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparision of packet scheduling algorithms for OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069823S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4813726,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoyi Xu","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37395024500"},{"name":"Yanlei Shang","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanlei","lastName":"Shang","id":"37558612300"},{"name":"Haiming Wang","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292552300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813726","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Microphones","Wideband","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Signal detection","Frequency estimation","TV","Bandwidth","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","microphones","signal detection","singular value decomposition","spectral analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular value decomposition","SVD","wireless microphone signal detection","wideband cognitive radio network","wireless regional area network","WRAN","data matrix","wireless channel","spectrum efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","primary user (PU)","secondary user (SU)","probability of detection (Pd)","probability of false alarm (Pf)","singular value decomposition (SVD)","wireless microphone (WM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813726","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813726","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","abstract":"In a wireless regional area network (WRAN), the presence of wireless microphone (WM) signals must be detected as primary users. However, very narrow bandwidth and low power makes it difficult to sense WM signals especially when these WM signals are distributed in a wideband spectrum. In this paper, a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based approach is presented to sense and estimate multiple WM signals in a wideband spectrum. After performing SVD on the received data matrix, the presence and the number of WM signals can be detected and then the center frequencies of these WM signals can be estimated. By doing so, it can be determined that which channels are occupied and which are still vacant. Such that those unoccupied spectra are still available for the secondary users and the spectrum efficiency can be improved. Simulation results prove the better detection performance by comparing the proposed method and the traditional energy detection. Simulations also show a high frequency estimation precision by using the proposed SVD-based algorithm as well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813726.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of SVD to sense wireless microphone signals in a wideband cognitive radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4813726/","displayDocTitle":"Application of SVD to sense wireless microphone signals in a wideband cognitive radio network","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586994","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of SVD to sense wireless microphone signals in a wideband cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079544S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813727,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

In most cases, this high peak signal often forces practical amplifiers to operate in the nonlinear region and causes additional degradation to the system's performance. Since the frequency bandwidth is a scarce resource, it is inevitable that a wireless communication system would have to operate in an environment that is prone to interference. Therefore, it is important to understand how an OFDM system performs in such situations. In this paper, we analyze the joint effect of nonlinear distortion produced by high power amplifiers (HPAs) and narrowband interference (NBI) on the performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) OFDM system in Rayleigh fading channels. We then extend the analytical model to be in compliance with the IEEE 802.11n standard for the purpose of simulation. The theoretical results are verified with the simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813727","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of nonlinear amplifiers and narrowband interference in MIMO-OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of nonlinear amplifiers and narrowband interference in MIMO-OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813727/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10571994","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813727/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of nonlinear amplifiers and narrowband interference in MIMO-OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068618S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813728,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Liu","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406554700"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403440900"},{"name":"Marek E.

In monopulse target estimation, a 2D antenna array of 64 elements is employed for horizontal and vertical polarizations. For such a system sum and difference beamformers are required to estimate the target directional coordinates. In a previous communication we proposed a sparse subarray structure to reduce the computational burden. In extension to this work now we look at the problem of large amount of multipliers required for adaptive subarray systems. For eight channel fully reconfigurable subarray system, an estimated 568 multipliers are required for two polarizations. In order to reduce this requirement we propose a serial MAC architecture where four parallel multipliers are employed serially using one multiplier. In this case one fourth reduction is achieved and adaptive system can be accommodated on single FPGA device. A complex subarray adaptive beamformer is implemented using the serial MAC structure on a Xilinx device. Device occupation of the proposed adaptive system is four times better than that of parallel adaptive system.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813735","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813735.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A serial MAC architecture for FPGA implementation of a complex adaptive beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813735/","displayDocTitle":"A serial MAC architecture for FPGA implementation of a complex adaptive beamformer","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813735/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10586996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A serial MAC architecture for FPGA implementation of a complex adaptive beamformer","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03784S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813743,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenfei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering (SECTE), University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenfei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38189821200"},{"name":"Willy Susilo","affiliation":["Centre for Computer and Information Security Research (CCISR), School of Computer Science and Software Engineering (SCSSE), University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Willy","lastName":"Susilo","id":"37323637000"},{"name":"Raad Raad","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering (SECTE), University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Raad","lastName":"Raad","id":"37406848000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813743","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1922},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813743","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Public key cryptography","Identity-based encryption","Public key","Computer networks","Telecommunication computing","Mobile computing","Computer network management","Identity management systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","private key cryptography","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad-hoc network key management","certificateless public key encryption schemes","MANET","public key cryptography","identity-based cryptography","certificate authority","private key cryptography","key generation center","Shamir secret sharing scheme","partial distribution system","network efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["certificateless cryptography","MANET","AODV","OPNET","public key cryptography","identity-based cryptography","secret sharing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an idea of adopting certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) schemes over mobile ad hoc network (MANET), which has not been explored before. In current literature, essentially there exists two main approaches, namely the public key cryptography and identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. Unfortunately, they both have some inherent drawbacks. In the public key cryptography system, a certificate authority (CA) is required to issue certificates between users' public keys and private keys to ensure their authenticity, whilst in an ID-based cryptography system, users' private keys are generated by a key generation center (KGC), which means the KGC knows every users' keys (the key escrow problem). To avoid these obstacles, Al-Riyami and Paterson proposed certificateless cryptography systems where the public keys do not need to be certified and the KGC does not know users' keys. Essentially, certificateless cryptography relies between the public key cryptography and ID-based cryptography. In this work, we adopt this system's advantage over MANET. To implement CL-PKE over MANET and to make it practical, we incorporate the idea of Shamir's secret sharing scheme. The master secret keys are shared among some or all the MANET nodes. This makes the system self-organized once the network has been initiated. In order to provide more flexibility, we consider both a full distribution system and a partial distribution system. Furthermore, we carry out two simulations to support our schemes. We firstly simulate our scheme to calculate our encryption, decryption and key distribution efficiency. Then we also simulate our scheme with AODV to test the network efficiency. The simulations are performed over OPNET.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813743","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813743.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile ad-hoc network key management with certificateless cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mobile ad-hoc network key management with certificateless cryptography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561191","htmlLink":"/document/4813743/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile ad-hoc network key management with certificateless cryptography","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082487S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4813744,"authors":[{"name":"Fazirulhisyam Hashim","affiliation":["University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Fazirulhisyam","lastName":"Hashim","id":"37411256700"},{"name":"Abbas Jamalipour","affiliation":["University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Jamalipour","id":"37275028900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-7684-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4813744","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Telecommunication traffic","Scalability","Quality of service","Statistics","Next generation networking","Frequency domain analysis","Fluid flow measurement","Force measurement","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","quality of service","statistical analysis","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling strategy","disparate access networks","next generation mobile networks","quality of service","traffic statistics","anomaly detection","frequency domain analysis"]}],"abstract":"Integration of disparate access networks in Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) introduces several implementation issues to the quality of service (QoS) and security aspects. The large amount of generated traffic in the network imposes scalability issue which significantly affects the performance of traffic measurement and anomaly detection. While the use of sampling is capable of addressing the scalability problem, the incompleteness of sampled traffic statistics has led to inaccurate traffic inferences, thereby reducing the effectiveness of anomaly detection. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing an adaptive sampling strategy which is capable of providing necessary traffic statistics for accurate and scalable NGMN anomaly detection. The sampling strategy utilizes frequency domain analysis to determine the severity level of the traffic. Together with the flow sizes, these two parameters constitute the formulation of the sampling decision. While the accuracy parameter is composed by the traffic behavior, the scalability issue is addressed by ensuring optimal utilization of the memory cache. Performance evaluation indicates that the proposed technique is capable of providing complete traffic statistics for detecting malicious traffic and also improves the scalability problem in the network.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813744","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4811121/4813643/04813744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2008.4813744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813643","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sampling strategy for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in NGMN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sampling strategy for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in NGMN","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813744/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561192","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4813744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sampling strategy for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in NGMN","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"P092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061931S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4811121","isNumber":"4813643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4811121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4813643","articleId":"4813744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4813768,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad M.

Our algorithm extends the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to cope with goals that are specified in a subspace of the manipulator configuration space through which the search tree is being grown. Underspecified goals occur naturally in arm planning, where the final end effector position is crucial but the configuration of the rest of the arm is not. To achieve this, the algorithm bootstraps an optimal local controller based on the transpose of the Jacobian to a global RRT search. The resulting approach, known as Jacobian transpose-directed rapidly exploring random trees (JT-RRTs), is able to combine the configuration space exploration of RRTs with a workspace goal bias to produce direct paths through complex environments extremely efficiently, without the need for any inverse kinematics. We compare our algorithm to a recently-developed competing approach and provide results from both simulation and a 7 degree-of-freedom robotic arm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized path planning for redundant manipulators without inverse kinematics","publicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","doi":"10.1109/ICHR.2007.4813913","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","pdfPath":"/iel5/4807937/4813825/04813913.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHR.2007.4813913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Randomized path planning for redundant manipulators without inverse kinematics","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813913/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10571929","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized path planning for redundant manipulators without inverse kinematics","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"0074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052741S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4807937","isNumber":"4813825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4807937","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4813825","articleId":"4813913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4813926,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Minato","affiliation":["Asada Project, ERATO,Japan Science and Technology Agency Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Minato","id":"37302023700"},{"name":"Yuichiro Yoshikawa","affiliation":["Asada Project, ERATO,Japan Science and Technology Agency Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Yoshikawa","id":"37286859300"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Noda","affiliation":["Department of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Noda","id":"37959545300"},{"name":"Shuhei Ikemoto","affiliation":["Department of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Shuhei Ikemoto","id":"37659393100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ishiguro","affiliation":["Department of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ishiguro","id":"37274136400"},{"name":"Minoru Asada","affiliation":["Osaka Daigaku, Suita, Osaka, JP"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Asada","id":"37276874800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1861-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1862-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-0572"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-0580"}],"articleNumber":"4813926","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive robotics","Biomimetics","Intelligent robots","Machine intelligence","Intelligent structures","Buildings","Humanoid robots","Robot sensing systems","Human robot interaction","Skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","cognitive systems","humanoid robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["child robot","biomimetic body","cognitive developmental robotics","Socially-Synergistic Intelligence","Socio-SI group","intelligent machines","human social development","humanoid robot"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new research platform, CB\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, a child robot with biomimetic body for cognitive developmental robotics developed by the Socially-Synergistic Intelligence (Hereafter, Socio-SI) group of JST ERATO Asada Project.

This leaves a substantial gap in the management of electrical hazards in Research and Development (R&D) and specialized high voltage and high power equipment. Examples include lasers, accelerators, capacitor banks, electroplating systems, induction and dielectric heating systems, etc. Although all such systems are fed by 50/60 Hz alternating current (ac) power, we find substantial use of direct current (dc) electrical energy, and the use of capacitors, inductors, batteries, and radiofrequency (RF) power. The electrical hazards of these forms of electricity and their systems are different than for 50/60 Hz power. Over the past 10 years there has been an effort to develop a method of classifying all of the electrical hazards found in all types of R&D and utilization equipment. Examples of the variation of these hazards from NFPA 70E include (a) high voltage can be harmless, if the available current is sufficiently low, (b) low voltage can be harmful if the available current/power is high, (c) high voltage capacitor hazards are unique and include severe reflex action, affects on the heart, and tissue damage, and (d) arc flash hazard analysis for dc and capacitor systems are not provided in existing standards. This work has led to a comprehensive electrical hazard classification system that is based on various research conducted over the past 100 years, on analysis of such systems in R&D, and on decades of experience. Initially, national electrical safety codes required the qualified worker only to know the source voltage to determine the shock hazard. Later, as arc flash hazards were understood, the fault current and clearing time were needed. These items are still insufficient to fully characterize all types of electrical hazards. The new comprehensive electrical hazard classification system uses a combination of voltage, shock current available, fault current available, power, energy, and waveform to classify all forms of electrical hazards. Based on this electrical hazard classification system, many new tools have been developed, including (a) work controls for these hazards, (b) better selection of PPE for R&D work, (c) improved training, and (d) a new Severity Ranking Tool that is used to rank electrical accidents and incidents with various forms of electrical energy.","doi":"10.1109/ESW.2009.4813972","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE IAS Electrical Safety Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810098/4813956/04813972.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4813956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESW.2009.4813972","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE IAS Electrical Safety Workshop","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complete electrical hazard classification system and its application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4813972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A complete electrical hazard classification system and its application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4813972/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4813972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10571744","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","conferenceDate":"2-6 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complete electrical hazard classification system and its application","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"ESW2009-23_Complete_Electrical_Hazards_Classificat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084077S","chronDate":"2-6 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4810098","isNumber":"4813956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810098","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4813956","articleId":"4813972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814129,"authors":[{"name":"Raimund Moser","affiliation":["Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Raimund","lastName":"Moser","id":"37720467400"},{"name":"Witold Pedrycz","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","id":"37271832400"},{"name":"Giancarlo Succi","affiliation":["Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Succi","id":"37299261900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4486-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-079-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"4814129","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":192,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Predictive models","Testing","Software metrics","Logistics","Software engineering","Resource management","Permission","Java","Classification tree analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","decision trees","Java","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","program diagnostics","regression analysis","software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative analysis","change metrics","static code attribute","defect prediction","product related software metrics","process related software metrics","Java file classification","Eclipse project","machine learning","logistic regression","naive Bayes method","decision tree","cost-sensitive classification","software quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cost-sensitive classification","defect prediction","software metrics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814129","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814109/4814110/04814129.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368114","doi":"10.1145/1368088.1368114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814110","publicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative analysis of the efficiency of change metrics and static code attributes for defect prediction","abstract":"In this paper we present a comparative analysis of the predictive power of two different sets of metrics for defect prediction.

To reap the benefits of SPLs, their designs need to be stable. Design stability encompasses the sustenance of the product line's modularity properties in the presence of changes to both the core and varying features. It is usually assumed that aspect-oriented programming promotes better modularity and changeability of product lines than conventional variability mechanisms, such as conditional compilation. However, there is no empirical evidence on its efficacy to prolong design stability of SPLs through realistic development scenarios. This paper reports a quantitative study that evolves two SPLs to assess various design stability facets of their aspect-oriented implementations. Our investigation focused upon a multi-perspective analysis of the evolving product lines in terms of modularity, change propagation, and feature dependency. We have identified a number of scenarios which positively or negatively affect the architecture stability of aspectual SPLs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814110","publicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814109/4814110/04814137.pdf","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving software product lines with aspects","doi":"10.1145/1368088.1368124","startPage":"261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-18 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evolving software product lines with aspects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814137/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572168","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4814137/","conferenceDate":"10-18 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving software product lines with aspects","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"80790261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080545S","chronDate":"10-18 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4814109","isNumber":"4814110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814109","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4814110","articleId":"4814137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814150,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Eichberg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Eichberg","id":"37284100500"},{"name":"Sven Kloppenburg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Kloppenburg","id":"37831472300"},{"name":"Karl Klose","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Klose","id":"38189866200"},{"name":"Mira Mezini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Mira","lastName":"Mezini","id":"37284102900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4486-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-079-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"4814150","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Production facilities","Computer languages","Logic programming","Gettering","Java","Permission","Engines","Programming profession","Data analysis","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","program verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous checking","structural program dependencies","program elements","architectural level decisions","design level decisions","implementation level decisions","declarative queries","programming language module","logic queries","incremental evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["continuous checking","controlling program dependencies","datalog","static analysis"]}],"abstract":"Dependencies between program elements need to be modeled from different perspectives reflecting architectural, design, and implementation level decisions. To avoid erosion of the intended structure of the code, it is necessary to explicitly codify these different perspectives on the permitted dependencies and to detect violations continuously and incrementally as software evolves. We propose an approach that uses declarative queries to group source elements - across programming language module boundaries - into overlapping ensembles. The dependencies between these ensembles are also specified as logic queries. The approach has been integrated into the incremental build process of Eclipse to ensure continuous checking, using an engine for tabled and incremental evaluation of logic queries. Our evaluation shows that our approach is fast enough for day-to-day use along the incremental build process of modern IDEs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defining and continuous checking of structural program dependencies","publicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1145/1368088.1368142","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814109/4814110/04814150.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-18 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Defining and continuous checking of structural program dependencies","conferenceDate":"10-18 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814150/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10572181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defining and continuous checking of structural program dependencies","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"80790391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077725S","chronDate":"10-18 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4814109","isNumber":"4814110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814109","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4814110","articleId":"4814150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4814157,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyin Wang","affiliation":["Key laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498400"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Key laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280173200"},{"name":"Tao Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37269659500"},{"name":"John Anvik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Anvik","id":"37326554800"},{"name":"Jiasu Sun","affiliation":["Key laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiasu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37281412800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4486-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-079-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"4814157","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":536},"abstract":"An open source project typically maintains an open bug repository so that bug reports from all over the world can be gathered. When a new bug report is submitted to the repository, a person, called a triager, examines whether it is a duplicate of an existing bug report. If it is, the triager marks it as duplicate and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature, there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach, when a new bug report arrives, its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports. Then, a small number of existing bug reports are suggested to the triager as the most similar bug reports to the new bug report. Finally, the triager examines the suggested bug reports to determine whether the new bug report duplicates an existing bug report. We calibrated our approach on a subset of the Eclipse bug repository and evaluated our approach on a subset of the Firefox bug repository. The experimental results show that our approach can detect 67%-93% of duplicate bug reports in the Firefox bug repository, compared to 43%-72% using natural language information alone.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814109/4814110/04814157.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"2008 ACM/IEEE 30th International Conference on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1145/1368088.1368151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to detecting duplicate bug reports using natural language and execution information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Costs","Software maintenance","Software quality","Testing","Computer bugs","Laboratories","Educational technology","Computer science education","Open source software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","natural language processing","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["execution information","triager","natural language information","Eclipse bug repository","information retrieval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["duplicate bug report","execution information","information retrieval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-18 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"An approach to detecting duplicate bug reports using natural language and execution information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10572188","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","conferenceDate":"10-18 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to detecting duplicate bug reports using natural language and execution information","confLoc":"Leipzig, Germany","sourcePdf":"80790461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107479S","chronDate":"10-18 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4814109","isNumber":"4814110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814109","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4814110","articleId":"4814157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4814164,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Zimmermann","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"38563076700"},{"name":"Nachiappan Nagappan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Nachiappan","lastName":"Nagappan","id":"37267730300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4486-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-079-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"4814164","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":170,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1039},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality management","Resource management","Network servers","Quality assurance","Costs","Predictive models","Software engineering","Software measurement","Engineering management","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defects prediction","network analysis","dependency graphs","software development","quality assurance","resources allocation","code complexity metrics","central program units","Windows developers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["defect prediction","dependency graph","network analysis","windows server 2003"]}],"abstract":"In software development, resources for quality assurance are limited by time and by cost.

In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10% points higher than for models built from complexity metrics.

Most of the papers have been previously reported successfully in bandwidth enhancement using bootstrapping technique. This paper introduces a series-shunt bootstrapping circuit which is boosted up the bandwidth to GHz. The modeling of the circuit exploits a series-shunt positive capacitive feedback. Feedback is applied to a buffered differential pair to obtain a bootstrap action. The result is only based on the modeling using MATLAB. Utilizing the dissimilar values of photodetector capacitance, the bandwidth does not alter to a great extent. Therefore, this circuit is suitable to implement in high noise environment especially in optical wireless link.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810096/4814215/04814232.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","doi":"10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of a Series-Shunt Bootstrapping Pre-amplifier Circuit for Free Space Optics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical buffering","Mathematical model","Optical feedback","Bandwidth","Photodetectors","Capacitance","Optical noise","Feedback circuits","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrap circuits","capacitance","optical links","photodetectors","preamplifiers","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["series-shunt bootstrapping pre-amplifier circuit","free space optics","optical wireless receiver","photodetector capacitance","bandwidth enhancement","series-shunt positive capacitive feedback","Matlab","optical wireless link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bootstrap","series-shunt circuit","optical wireless front-end receive","pre-amplifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of a Series-Shunt Bootstrapping Pre-amplifier Circuit for Free Space Optics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814232/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10587004","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of a Series-Shunt Bootstrapping Pre-amplifier Circuit for Free Space Optics","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"NCTT-MCP-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060355S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810096","isNumber":"4814215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810096","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4814215","articleId":"4814232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814233,"authors":[{"name":"Zaineb A.

It is shown that as number of users grows, the power per chip must be decreased to control the SRS-induced tilt and to keep it below acceptable levels. It is also shown that SRS-induced tilt can significantly limit the power per chip levels when the number of users is large.

SBS causes backward scattering of pump light and this in turn causes a reduction of output power. It was found that the effects of SBS take place at small value of output power at longer distance because of the system have low threshold power value.

RD code is constructed using code level and data level, one of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at data level is always zero, which means that Phase intensity Induced Phase (PIIN) is reduced. We find that the performance of the RD code will be better than Modified Frequency Hopping (MFH) and Hadamard codes. It has been observed through simulation and theoretical results that BER for RD code perform significantly better than other codes. Proof-of-principle simulations of encoding with 3 channels, and 10 Gbps data transmission have been successfully demonstrated together with FBG decoding scheme for canceling the code level from SAG-signal.","doi":"10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814270","publicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810096/4814215/04814270.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Design of Optical Code-Division Multiple Access Network Using Random Diagonal Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814270/","displayDocTitle":"Effective Design of Optical Code-Division Multiple Access Network Using Random Diagonal Codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561220","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814270/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Design of Optical Code-Division Multiple Access Network Using Random Diagonal Codes","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"NCTT-MCP-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047555S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810096","isNumber":"4814215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810096","xplore-issue":"4814215","articleId":"4814270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4814283,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Lynn Tan","affiliation":["Digital Signal Processing Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor"],"firstName":"Jo Lynn","lastName":"Tan","id":"38187580200"},{"name":"Ahmad Zuri bin Sha'ameri","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Ahmad Zuri","lastName":"bin Sha'ameri","id":"37592398600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2214-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2215-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4814283","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital communication","Kernel","Frequency shift keying","Time frequency analysis","Amplitude shift keying","Digital modulation","Signal analysis","Signal processing","Digital signal processing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","Wigner distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive smooth windowed Wigner Ville distribution","digital communication signal","time frequency distributions","digital modulation signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive kernel TFD","digital communication signal","smooth-windowed Wigner-Ville distribution (SWWVD)","time-frequency analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814283","abstract":"Time-frequency distributions (TFD's) are powerful tools to represent the energy content of time-varying signal in both time and frequency domain simultaneously but it suffers from interference due to cross terms. Various methods have been described to remove these cross-terms and typically signal dependent. Thus, there is no single TFD with a fixed window or kernel that produce accurate time-frequency representation (TFR) for all type of signals. In this paper, an adaptive smooth-windowed Wigner-Ville distribution (SWWVD) is designed for digital modulation signals such as ASK, FSK and M-ary FSK where its separable kernel parameters are determined automatically from the parameters of the input signal. This optimum kernel is capable to remove the cross-terms and maintain accurate time-frequency representation. Compared with kernel parameters derived mathematically, it is shown that the adaptive SWWVD gave similar accuracy in the time-frequency representation.","doi":"10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814283","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810096/4814215/04814283.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Smooth-Windowed Wigner-Ville Distribution for Digital Communication Signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Smooth-Windowed Wigner-Ville Distribution for Digital Communication Signal","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814283/","accessionNumber":"10561224","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814283/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Smooth-Windowed Wigner-Ville Distribution for Digital Communication Signal","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"NCTT-MCP-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058071S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810096","isNumber":"4814215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810096","xplore-issue":"4814215","articleId":"4814283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814293,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Al-Ghadhban","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Al-Ghadhban","id":"38273969100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2214-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2215-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4814293","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","OFDM","Frequency diversity","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Concatenated codes","Transmitting antennas","Power capacitors","Space technology","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space frequency time codes","MIMO-OFDM systems","multilayered concatenated coding","spatial multiplexing","transmit diversity","bandwidth efficient coding","serial interference nulling","parallel interference nulling","cancellation algorithms","ordering criteria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","Space Frequency Time Codes","Concatenated TCM-STBC","IQ-TCM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study multi-layered concatenated coding for MIMO-OFDM systems.

The planning process covered configuration planning, topology planning and Quality of Services (QoS). In configuration planning, the radio network planner selects the optimum configuration of the base station (BS) for the planned cell to meet the network quality targets taking into consideration investment and operating cost limits.

One application would be in WCDMA adaptive beam forming technique. Adaptive antenna has dynamic beam to cater for users' needs and provides better capacity for mobile communication but requires more intelligent and advance beam forming algorithm such as genetic algorithm. Compared to Standard GAs, Parallel Distributed GAs promise substantial gain in terms of convergence performance. In this paper, an embedded parallel and distributed genetic algorithm (EPDGA) with dynamic parameter setting on a multiprocessor system is proposed. The proposed scheme applies a master-slave architecture where the total active unit equipments (UE) are distributed to subpopulations (slaves) that evolve separately and exchange individuals occasionally. The power usage at Node B is used as fitness function to compare the performance of EPDGA and standard GA. Simulation results show that EPDGA converges faster and is better in adaptive antenna beam forming in the aspect of power usage at Node B as compared to standard GA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Parallel Distributed Artificial Intelligent Processors for Adaptive Beam Forming in WCDMA System","publicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","doi":"10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814302","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810096/4814215/04814302.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Parallel Distributed Artificial Intelligent Processors for Adaptive Beam Forming in WCDMA System","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814302/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10561232","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Parallel Distributed Artificial Intelligent Processors for Adaptive Beam Forming in WCDMA System","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"NCTT-MCP-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089504S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810096","isNumber":"4814215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810096","xplore-issue":"4814215","articleId":"4814302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814303,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

However, sensing results reporting requires perfect channel to avoid the performance degradation. It also requires a large bandwidth under the hypothesis of large number of cognitive users. This paper presents a hard decision auto-correction reporting scheme that is able to correct the error in the reported bit directly. This system further minimizes the average number of the reporting bits by allowing only the user with detection information (binary decision 1) to report its result. The sensing performance is investigated and the numerical results show significant decrease in reporting bits without affecting the sensing performance.","doi":"10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814306","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810096/4814215/04814306.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCTT.2008.4814306","publicationTitle":"2008 6th National Conference on Telecommunication Technologies and 2008 2nd Malaysia Conference on Photonics","startPage":"377","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Sensing under Limited Band Control Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Sensing under Limited Band Control Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814306/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814306/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10587044","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Sensing under Limited Band Control Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"NCTT-MCP-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076692S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4810096","isNumber":"4814215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810096","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4814215","articleId":"4814306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4814348,"authors":[{"name":"Yongmei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongmei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37278734300"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"},{"name":"Ning Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292712200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4814348","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Convergence","Scheduling algorithm","Iterative algorithms","Throughput","Hardware","Mercury (metals)","Sum product algorithm","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","parity check codes","product codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo-sum-product algorithm","TSP algorithm","SSP algorithm","shuffled-sum-product algorithm","quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","low-density parity-check codes","parallel decoder architecture","extrinsic information transfer chart","memory-efficient architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC, quasi-cyclic, turbo decoding, shuffled decoding, sum-product decoding, EXIT charts"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814348","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814348.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.060349","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.060349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-efficient and high-throughput decoding of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","abstract":"We propose turbo-sum-product (TSP) and shuffled-sum-product (SSP) decoding algorithms for quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes, which not only achieve faster convergence and better error performance than the sum-product algorithm, but also require less memory in partly parallel decoder architectures.

Therein, we have also highlighted the main advantages of using Pearson approximation instead of the usual Log-Normal one, and compared the proposed method with other approaches available in the open technical literature. However, despite being very accurate, the proposed method may be, in some circumstances, computational demanding since a non-linear least-squares problem needs to be solved numerically to get an accurate approximation. Motivated by the above consideration, the aim of this Letter is to provide an alternative approach for computing the parameters of the approximating Pearson distribution. The proposed solution is based on the Method of Moments (MoMs) in the logarithmic domain. In particular, by using some known properties of the Laplace transform, we will show that the MGF of the Log-Normal power sum in the logarithmic domain (denoted as log-MGF) can be obtained from the Mellin transform of the MGF of the Log-Normal power sum in the linear domain. From the estimated log-MGF, we will then compute the desired log-moments required for Pearson approximation. Numerical results will be also shown in order to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","startPage":"893","endPage":"898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814351.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further results on the approximation of log-normal power sum via pearson type IV distribution: a general formula for log-moments computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814351/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Further results on the approximation of log-normal power sum via pearson type IV distribution: a general formula for log-moments computation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572835","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further results on the approximation of log-normal power sum via pearson type IV distribution: a general formula for log-moments computation","sourcePdf":"0893-tc0904-direnzo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085352S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4814352,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The classical Rayleigh and Rician pdf's turn out to be special cases of the derived pdf.

The resulting bit error rate (BER) expression is derived as an infinite series. The analytical expressions are validated by simulation, and the I/Q imbalance related performance degradation is quantified.

We express the SEP in a triple integral form which is further simplified. The simplified form requires a single integral evaluation of standard \"erf\" function. Using the derived exact SEP formula, we plot SEP for a number of selected 3-D constellations. The SEP obtained using the proposed formula is validated by simulation results.

This measure gives insight into a fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and information rate of MIMO channels, enabling to determine the required codeword length to achieve a prescribed error probability at a given rate below the channel capacity. We quantify the effects of the number of antennas, channel coherence time, and spatial fading correlation on the MIMO exponent. In addition, the general formulae for the ergodic capacity and the cutoff rate in the presence of spatial correlation are deduced from the exponent expressions. These formulae are applicable to arbitrary structures of transmit and receive correlation, encompassing all the previously known results as special cases of our expressions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"972","endPage":"985","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.04.050673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.04.050673","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814365.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gallager's exponent for MIMO channels: a reliability-rate tradeoff","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814365/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gallager's exponent for MIMO channels: a reliability-rate tradeoff","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572830","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4814365/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gallager's exponent for MIMO channels: a reliability-rate tradeoff","sourcePdf":"0972-tc0904-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067356S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4814366,"authors":[{"name":"Momin Uppal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814366/4814366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Momin Uppal received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering with highest distinction from GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in 2002.

This paper presents a DPC based code design for BCs. We consider the case in which there is an individual rate/signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each user. For a fixed transmitter power, we choose the linear transmit precoding matrix such that the SINRs at users are uniformly maximized, thus ensuring the best bit-error rate performance. We start with Cover's simplest two-user Gaussian BC and present a coding scheme that operates 1.44 dB from the boundary of the capacity region at the rate of one bit per real sample (b/s) for each user. We then extend the coding strategy to a two-user MIMO Gaussian BC with two transmit antennas at the base-station and develop the first limit-approaching code design using nested turbo codes for DPC. At the rate of 1 b/s for each user, our design operates 1.48 dB from the capacity region boundary. We also consider the performance of our scheme over a slow fading BC. For two transmit antennas, simulation results indicate a performance loss of only 1.4 dB, 1.64 dB and 1.99 dB from the theoretical limit in terms of the total transmission power for the two, three and four user case, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814366.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code design for MIMO broadcast channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814366/","displayDocTitle":"Code design for MIMO broadcast channels","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572831","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814366/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code design for MIMO broadcast channels","sourcePdf":"0986-tc0904-uppal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104035S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814369,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814369/4814369-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongshan Zhang received the M.S. degree in computer science in 2001 and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2004 from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).

We provide simple and easy-to-evaluate asymptotic BEP and SEP expressions which show that at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) the performance of the considered combining schemes depends on certain moments of the noise and interference impairing the transmission. We derive general rules for calculation of these moments and we provide closed-form expressions for the moments of several practically important types of noise such as spatially dependent and spatially independent Gaussian mixture noise, correlated synchronous and asynchronous co-channel interference, and correlated Gaussian interference. From our asymptotic results we conclude that (a) the asymptotic performance loss of binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) with NC compared to binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with MRC is always 6 dB independent of the type of noise and the number of diversity branches, (b) the asymptotic performance loss of differential EGC compared to MRC is always 3 dB for additive white Gaussian noise but depends on the number of diversity branches and may be larger or smaller than 3 dB for other types of noise, and (c) not only fading correlation but also noise correlation negatively affects the performance of quadratic diversity combiners.","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814371.pdf","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070085","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Fading","Gaussian noise","Additive white noise","Performance loss","Phase noise","Signal to noise ratio","Closed-form solution","Interchannel interference","Frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","cochannel interference","diversity reception","error statistics","frequency shift keying","phase shift keying","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratic diversity combining receivers","correlated Ricean fading","nonGaussian noise","bit-error probability","symbol-error probability","maximum-ratio combining","differential equal-gain combining","noncoherent combining","signal-to-noise ratio","independent Gaussian mixture noise","asynchronous cochannel interference","correlated synchronous cochannel interference","binary frequency-shift keying","binary phase-shift keying","additive white Gaussian noise","quadratic diversity combiners"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic analysis, non-Gaussian noise and interference, fading channels, coherent maximum ratio combining, differential equal gain combining, noncoherent combining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic BEP and SEP of quadratic diversity combining receivers in correlated ricean fading, non-gaussian noise, and interference","accessionNumber":"10572846","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814371/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic BEP and SEP of quadratic diversity combining receivers in correlated ricean fading, non-gaussian noise, and interference","sourcePdf":"1039-tc0904-nezampour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102046S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814372,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Zanella","affiliation":["IEIIT-BO/CNR, DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814372/4814372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Zanella (S'99\u2013M'00) was born in Ferrara, Italy, in December 1971.

The JSI for the pilot symbols is estimated to assist estimation of the time-varying frequency selective channel coefficients by updating the noise covariance matrix. We also derive the optimum (sufficient statistics) chip combining weights for the data symbols that require the JSI; hence, the JSI for the data symbols is iteratively estimated using the decoder output.

In this paper, the IA problem is cast in a game-theoretic framework and is formulated as a potential game. This formulation accommodates previously proposed algorithms and, in addition, gives us a framework that enables the design of new distributed and convergent algorithms for IA including algorithms with nonidentical utility functions for the users. Two new convergence results for potential games are then derived. The first result establishes the convergence of a class of potential games to the global solution while following best response iterations and when noise is added. The second result establishes the convergence of potential games to the Nash equilibria of the game while following random better response iterations. The first result combined with the potential game formulation allows us to show that for a large class of network scenarios, arbitrarily small noise assures the convergence of best response IA algorithms, including the eigeniterations, to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the globally optimal signature sequence set. The second result enables the design of reduced feedback mechanisms for IA that converge to desirable solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814376.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814376/","displayDocTitle":"A game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814376/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance","sourcePdf":"1087-tc0904-menon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101229S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814379,"authors":[{"name":"Michael L.B.

To partially recover the performance loss associated with symbol- by-symbol noncoherent detection, we consider the application of multiple-symbol detection (MSD), in which block-wise decisions are made using an observation window of several bit intervals. Specifically, we develop a fast search algorithm for optimal MSD and propose a reduced-complexity decision metric suitable for suboptimal MSD; performance results confirm that the optimal and suboptimal metrics perform comparably well. Significantly, the complexity of our receiver, on a per bit-decision basis, is only logarithmically dependent on the observation window size. We also present the framework for a decision-feedback receiver and obtain performance expressions for the ideal case of error-free feedback; these expressions serve as an upper bound to the performance of MSD. Analytical and simulation results indicate that as the observation window size increases, the performance of the MSD receiver approaches that of detection with channel state information. The conclusion is reached that the proposed implementation provides an attractive low-complexity mechanism for performing noncoherent MSD in FSO systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","volume":"57","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10572854","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814379/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast multiple-symbol detection for free-space optical communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast multiple-symbol detection for free-space optical communications","sourcePdf":"1119-tc0904-riediger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103996S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4814382,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Dong","affiliation":["Altera Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814382/4814382-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaofei Dong received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Davis in 2006.

In general, the effectiveness of MIMO precoding depends critically on the knowledge of channel state information available at the transmitter. In this work we describe a novel method for the downlink channel estimation based on a novel feedback mechanism. To minimize processing need at mobile units, the receiver in this new framework returns a fraction of its received data back for the base-station to extract downlink channel information in the form of a quadratic channel product. The base-station can then utilize the quadratic channel product to design channel-aware downlink precoders.

These channels are generally modeled as a mixture of Nakagami-m multipath fading and log-normal shadowing. The resulting composite probability density function (pdf) is not available in closed form, thereby making the performance evaluation of communication links in these channels cumbersome. In this paper, we propose to model composite channels by the G-distribution. This pdf arises when the log-normal shadowing is substituted by the inverse-Gaussian one. This substitution will prove to be very accurate for several shadowing conditions. In this paper we conduct a performance evaluation of single-user communication systems operating in a composite channel. Our study starts by deriving an analytical expression for the outage probability. Then, we derive the moment generating function of the G-distribution, hence facilitating the calculation of average bit error probabilities. We also derive analytical expressions for the channel capacity for three adaptive transmission techniques, namely, i) optimal rate adaptation with constant power, ii) optimal power and rate adaptation, and iii) channel inversion with fixed rate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814383.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070258","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance analysis of composite multipath/shadowing channels using the G-distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814383/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance analysis of composite multipath/shadowing channels using the G-distribution","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814383/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10572857","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance analysis of composite multipath/shadowing channels using the G-distribution","sourcePdf":"1162-tc0904-laourine.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083318S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4814384,"authors":[{"name":"Alkan Soysal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bah\u00e7esehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814384/4814384-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alkan Soysal (S'03, M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from University of Maryland, College Park, MD in 2006 and 2008 respectively.

When the transmitters have partial CSI, it is in the form of either the covariance matrix of the channel or the mean matrix of the channel. For the covariance feedback case, we mainly consider physical models that result in single-sided correlation structures. For the mean feedback case, we consider physical models that result in in-phase received signals. Under these assumptions, we analyze the MIMO-MAC from three different viewpoints. First, we consider a finite-sized system. We show that the optimum transmit directions of each user are the eigenvectors of its own channel covariance and mean feedback matrices, in the covariance and mean feedback models, respectively. Also, we find the conditions under which beamforming is optimal for all users. Second, in the covariance feedback case, we prove that the region where beamforming is optimal for all users gets larger with the addition of new users into the system. In the mean feedback case, we show through simulations that this is not necessarily true. Third, we consider the asymptotic case where the number of users is large. We show that in both no and partial CSI cases, beamforming is asymptotically optimal. In particular, in the case of no CSI, we show that a simple form of beamforming, which may be characterized as an arbitrary antenna selection scheme, achieves the sum capacity. In the case of partial CSI, we show that beamforming in the direction of the strongest eigenvector of the channel feedback matrix achieves the sum capacity. Finally, we generalize our covariance feedback results to double-sided correlation structures in the Appendix.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814384.pdf","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO multiple access channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Fading","MIMO","Feedback","Covariance matrix","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Channel state information","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","MIMO communication","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multiple access channel fading","multiinput multioutput multiple access channel","channel state information","transmitter","covariance matrix","single-sided correlation structures","finite-sized system","eigenvectors","mean feedback matrices","optimal beamforming","antenna selection scheme","sum capacity","channel feedback matrix","double-sided correlation structures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-userMIMO, MIMO multiple access channel partial CSI, covariance feedback, mean feedback, optimality of beamforming, large system analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO multiple access channels","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4814384/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572856","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO multiple access channels","sourcePdf":"1171-tc0904-soysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092579S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4814385,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

Assuming perfect channel state information at the receiver, the choice of the beamforming vector is made possible through a noiseless limited-rate feedback of one or more bits per coefficient to the transmitter. This paper proposes the use of beamforming codebooks based on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying (PSK) constellations, which essentially eliminates the need for storage of the codebook. We show that such codebooks perform arbitrarily close to the perfect feedback case as the constellation size increases, and that full diversity order is achieved. We demonstrate an equivalence between the beamforming codebook search problem with that of noncoherent sequence detection. Based on this we propose fast beamforming vector search algorithms. Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to show that the performance is comparable to the best known codebooks, and that the search complexity can be reduced by several orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4814345/04814385.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.04.070178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM and PSK codebooks for limited feedback MIMO beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814385/","displayDocTitle":"QAM and PSK codebooks for limited feedback MIMO beamforming","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572855","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814385/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM and PSK codebooks for limited feedback MIMO beamforming","sourcePdf":"1184-tc0904-ryan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096228S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4814345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4814345","articleId":"4814385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814386,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Shao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4814345/4814386/4814386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Shao (S'07) received the B.Sc. in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alberta, AB, Canada in 2006.

Therefore it reduces the design complexities of the receiver and increases the compatible characteristics for consumer electronics (CE).

The conventional soft error tolerant methods for soft errors on combinational logic do not provide enough high soft error tolerant capability with reasonably small performance penalty. This paper investigates the feasibility of designing quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) asynchronous circuits for high soft error tolerance. We analyze the behavior of null convention logic (NCL) circuits in the presence of particle strikes, and propose an asynchronous pipeline for soft-error correction and a novel technique to improve the robustness of threshold gates, which are basic components in NCL, against particle strikes by using Schmitt trigger circuit and resizing the feedback transistor. Experimental results show that the proposed threshold gates do not generate soft errors under the strike of a particle within a certain energy range if a proper transistor size is applied. The penalties, such as delay and power consumption, are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5419135/04814467.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Asynchronous Circuits for High Soft Error Tolerance in Deep Submicrometer CMOS Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814467/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Asynchronous Circuits for High Soft Error Tolerance in Deep Submicrometer CMOS Circuits","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142344","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814467/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Asynchronous Circuits for High Soft Error Tolerance in Deep Submicrometer CMOS Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wkuang-2011554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079208S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5419135","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5419135","articleId":"4814467","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814468,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Hok Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5313696/4814468/4814468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Hok Ho (S'06) received the B.Eng. degree (Honors) in computer engineering and the M.Phil. degree in computer science and engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

Fine-grained units are used for implementing control logic and bit-oriented operations, while parameterized and reconfigurable word-based coarse-grained units incorporating word-oriented lookup tables and floating-point operations are used to implement datapaths. In order to facilitate comparison with existing FPGA devices, the virtual embedded block scheme is proposed to model embedded blocks using existing field-programmable gate array (FPGA) tools. This methodology involves adopting existing FPGA resources to model the size, position, and delay of the embedded elements. The standard design flow offered by FPGA and computer-aided design vendors is then applied and static timing analysis can be used to estimate the performance of the FPGA with the embedded blocks. On selected floating-point benchmark circuits, our results indicate that the proposed architecture can achieve four times improvement in speed and 25 times reduction in area compared with a traditional FPGA device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814468/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10977503","volume":"17","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Floating-Point FPGA: Architecture and Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Floating-Point FPGA: Architecture and Modeling","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ho-2006616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070284S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5313696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5313696","articleId":"4814468","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814478,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

The computational cost of an MPC problem, which relies on the solution of an optimization problem at every time step, is dominated by operations on real matrices. In order to design an efficient and low-cost application-specific processor, we analyze the computational cost of MPC, and we propose a limited-resource host processor to be connected with an application-specific matrix coprocessor. The coprocessor uses a 16-b logarithmic number system arithmetic unit, which is designed using cotransformation, to carry out the required arithmetic operations. The proposed architecture is implemented by means of a hardware description language and then prototyped and emulated on a field-programmable gate array. Results on computation time and architecture area are presented and analyzed, and the functionality of the proposed architecture is verified using two case studies: a linear problem of a rotating antenna and a nonlinear glucose-regulation problem. The proposed MPC architecture yields a small-in-size and energy-efficient implementation that is capable of solving the aforementioned problems on the order of milliseconds, and we compare its performance and area requirements with other MPC designs that have appeared in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems

Moreover, the redundant row/column blocks can be used to replace faulty cells anywhere in the memory array. This global characteristic is helpful for repairing cluster faults. The proposed redundancy architecture can be easily integrated with the embedded memory cores. Based on the proposed global redundancy architecture, a heuristic modified essential spare pivoting (MESP) algorithm suitable for built-in implementation is also proposed. According to experimental results, the area overhead for implementing the MESP algorithm is very low. Due to efficient usage of redundancy, the manufacturing yield, repair rate, and reliability can be improved significantly.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5393244/04814490.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008996","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient BISR Techniques for Embedded Memories Considering Cluster Faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814490/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient BISR Techniques for Embedded Memories Considering Cluster Faults","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814490/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11084311","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient BISR Techniques for Embedded Memories Considering Cluster Faults","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lu-2008996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"4814490","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4814491,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5393244/4814491/4814491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan-Hao Huang (S'98\u2013M'02) was born in Taiwan in 1973.

This paper proposes a subword-detection processing (SDP) technique and a fine-grain soft-error-tolerance (FGSET) architecture to improve the performance of the digital signal processing circuit. In the SDP technique, the logic masking property of the soft error in the combinational circuit is utilized to mask the single-event upset (SEU) caused by disturbing particles in the inactive area. To further improve the performance, the masked portion of the datapath can be used as the estimation redundancy in the algorithmic softerror-tolerance (ASET) technique. This technique is called subword-detection and redundant processing (SDRP). In the FGSET architecture, the soft error in each processing element (fine grain) can be recovered by the arithmetic datapath-level ASET technique. Analysis of the fast Fourier transform processor example shows that the proposed FGSET architecture can improve the performance of the coarse-grain SET (CGSET) by 8.5 dB. The low-cost SDP technique (1.03x) yields a noise reduction of 5.3 dB over the CGSET approach (1.40x), while the efficient SDRP I (1.57x) and SDRP II (1.88x) techniques outperform the CGSET approach by 24.5 and 30.5 dB, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814491/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071373","htmlLink":"/document/4814491/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Soft-Error-Tolerant Digital Signal Processing Using Fine-Grain Subword-Detection Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Soft-Error-Tolerant Digital Signal Processing Using Fine-Grain Subword-Detection Processing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yhuang-2009636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117931S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"4814491","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814493,"authors":[{"name":"Kunhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Intels Design Technology and Solutions, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5393244/4814493/4814493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kunhyuk Kang (S'04-M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2002, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","Since 2007 he has been a Senior CAD engineer at Intel's Design Technology and Solutions, Hillsboro, OR.

Optimization analysis shows that 42% and 43% reduction in area and power can be obtained using our approach compared to the worst-case sizing.

The idea consists of compressing the data within each pixel prior to storage, and hence, reducing the size of the memory required for digital pixel sensor. The proposed compression algorithm uses a block-based differential coding scheme in which differential values are captured and quantized online. A time-domain encoding scheme is used in our CMOS image sensor in which the brightest pixel within each block fires first and is selected as the reference pixel. The differential values between subsequent pixels and the reference within each block are calculated and quantized, using a reduced number of bits as their dynamic range is compressed. The proposed scheme enables reduced error accumulation as full precision is used at the start of each block, while also enabling reduced memory requirement, and hence, enabling significant silicon area saving. A mathematical model is derived to analyze the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results on a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) platform illustrate that the proposed algorithm enables more than 50% memory saving at a peak signal-to-noise ratio level of 30 dB with 1.5 bit per pixel.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5419135/04814495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419135","startPage":"490","endPage":"500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Acquisition CMOS Image Sensor: From the Algorithm to Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Acquisition CMOS Image Sensor: From the Algorithm to Hardware Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142354","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Acquisition CMOS Image Sensor: From the Algorithm to Hardware Implementation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zhang-2011489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060168S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5419135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","articleId":"4814495","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814500,"authors":[{"name":"Naoya Onizawa","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5419135/4814500/4814500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naoya Onizawa (S'05) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

With our method, a decoder's longest wires are divided into several short wires with pipeline registers. Log-likelihood ratio messages transmitted along with these pipelined paths are thus sent over multiple clock cycles, and the decoder's critical path delay can be reduced while maintaining comparable bit error rate performance. The number of registers inserted into paths is estimated by using wiring information extracted from initial placement and routing information with a conventional LDPC decoder, and thus only necessary registers are inserted. Also, by inserting an even number of registers into the longer wires, two different codewords can be simultaneously decoded, which improves the throughput at a small penalty in area. We present our design flow as well as post-layout simulation results for several versions of a length-1024, (3,6)-regular LDPC code. Using our technique, we achieve a maximum uncoded throughput of 13.21 Gb/s with an energy consumption of 0.098 nJ per uncoded bit at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n = 5 dB.

These images are the end product of processing raw data from the instrument, and their sample value distributions contain artificial regularities that are introduced by the conversion of raw data values to radiance units. It is shown that some of the best reported lossless compression results for these images are achieved by algorithms that significantly exploit these artifacts. This fact has not been widely reported and may not be widely recognized. Compression performance comparisons involving such algorithms and these standard AVIRIS images can be misleading if they are extrapolated to images that lack such artifacts, such as unprocessed hyperspectral images. In fact, two of these algorithms are shown to achieve rather unremarkable compression performance on a set of more recent AVIRIS images that do not contain appreciable calibration-induced artifacts. This newer set of AVIRIS images, which contains both calibrated and raw images, is made available for compression experiments. To underscore the potential impact of exploiting calibration-induced artifacts in the standard AVIRIS data sets, a compression algorithm is presented that achieves noticeably smaller compressed sizes for these data sets than is reported for any other algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2015291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165149/04814516.pdf","startPage":"2672","endPage":"2678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2015291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Calibration-Induced Artifacts in Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814516/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Calibration-Induced Artifacts in Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"47","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764029","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814516/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Calibration-Induced Artifacts in Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kiely-2015291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065384S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5165149","articleId":"4814516","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814527,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00dcrgen Jasperneite","affiliation":["IT-Institute Industrial IT, Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/4909480/4814527/4814527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J\u00fcrgen Jasperneite (M'98\u2013SM'06) studied electrical engineering and received the Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany, in 2002.","Since 2005, he has been a Full Professor of Computer Networks at the Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany.

In this paper we present a wireless unlicensed system that successfully coexists with the licensed systems in the same spectrum range. The proposed unlicensed system determines the level of signals and noise in each frequency band and properly adjusts the spectrum and power allocations subject to rate constraints. It employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and distributes each transmitted bit energy over all the bands using a novel concept of bit spectrum patterns. A distributed optimization problem is formulated as a dynamic selection of spectrum patterns and power allocations that are better suited to the available spectrum range without degrading the licensed system performance. Bit spectrum patterns are designed based on a normalized gradient approach and the transmission powers are minimized for a predefined quality of service (QoS). At the optimal equilibrium point, the receiver that employs a conventional correlation operation with the replica of the transmitted signal will have the same efficiency as the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver in the presence of noise and licensed systems. Additionally, the proposed approach maximizes the unlicensed system capacity for the optimal spectrum and power allocations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/4968160/04814528.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2009.2017391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2017391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4968160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Spectrum and Power Allocation for OFDM Unlicensed Wireless Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","System performance","Quality of service","Game theory","Aggregates","Switches","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","frequency allocation","gradient methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quality of service","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible spectrum allocation","power allocation","OFDM unlicensed wireless system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing modulation","distributed optimization problem","spectrum pattern selection","normalized gradient approach","quality-of-service","conventional correlation operation","minimum mean-squared error receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constraint optimization","distributed algorithms","game theory","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","spectrum sharing","unlicensed systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Spectrum and Power Allocation for OFDM Unlicensed Wireless Systems","volume":"3","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4814528/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10666071","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Spectrum and Power Allocation for OFDM Unlicensed Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"03jsyst02-clacatus-2017391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070053S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"4968160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4968160","articleId":"4814528","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814534,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Yu","affiliation":["Departamento de Control Autom\u00e1tico, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de, Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional Cinvestav IPN, Mexico, Mexico"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4814534","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy neural networks","Parameter estimation","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Backpropagation algorithms","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Least squares methods","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","blending","crude oil","fuzzy neural nets","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-neural-network modeling","crude-oil blending","structure identification","output spaces partitioning","input-output mapping","parameter identification","backpropagation algorithm","time-varying learning rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy neural networks","online clustering","crude-oil blending"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814534","abstract":"In this brief, we propose a new fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) modeling approach which is applied for the modeling of crude-oil blending.

The pin-to-pin ESD issue for differential LNAs is addressed for the first time in the literature.

The first LNA with double-diode ESD protection scheme exhibits the power gain of 17.9 dB and noise figure of 2.43 dB at 5 GHz. Its human-body-model (HBM) and machine-model (MM) ESD levels are 2.5 kV and 200 V, respectively. With the same total parasitic capacitance from ESD protection devices, the second LNA with the proposed double silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) ESD protection scheme has 6.5-kV HBM and 500-V MM ESD robustness, 17.9-dB power gain, and 2.54-dB noise figure at 5 GHz. The ESD test results have shown that the pin-to-pin ESD test is the most critical ESD-test pin combination for the conventional double-diode ESD protection scheme. With the proposed double-SCR ESD protection scheme, the pin-to-pin ESD robustness can be significantly improved without degrading RF performance. Experimental results have shown that the ESD protection circuit for LNA can be co-designed with the input matching network to simultaneously achieve excellent ESD robustness and RF performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Electrostatic discharge","CMOS process","Protection","Noise figure","Noise robustness","Circuit testing","Radio frequency","Power supplies","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","circuit stability","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","electrostatic discharge","elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","radiofrequency integrated circuits","silicon","solid-state rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential low-noise amplifier","pin-to-pin ESD robustness","CMOS process","double-diode electrostatic discharge protection","differential LNA","power gain","noise figure","human body model","HBM","machine model ESD levels","parasitic capacitance","double silicon-controlled rectifier","SCR","ESD-test pin","input matching network","RF amplifier","frequency 5 GHz","size 130 nm","power 10.3 mW","voltage 1.2 V","voltage 2.5 kV","voltage 200 V","voltage 6.5 kV","voltage 500 V","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge (ESD)","low-noise amplifier (LNA)","power-rail ESD clamp circuit","RF integrated circuit (RF IC)","silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR)","substrate-triggered technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909498/04814540.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5-GHz Differential Low-Noise Amplifier With High Pin-to-Pin ESD Robustness in a 130-nm CMOS Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 5-GHz Differential Low-Noise Amplifier With High Pin-to-Pin ESD Robustness in a 130-nm CMOS Process","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814540/","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814540/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10628397","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5-GHz Differential Low-Noise Amplifier With High Pin-to-Pin ESD Robustness in a 130-nm CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"57tmtt05-mker-part1-2017247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064781S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4909498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4909498","articleId":"4814540","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4814541,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El-Nozahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909498/4814541/4814541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed El-Nozahi (S'00) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in integrated circuits and systems at Texas A&M University, College Station.","From 2000 to 2004, he was a Teaching and Research Assistant with the Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, Ain Shams University.

Design guidelines to overcome the common breakdown, and tunability problems of the varactors for high power applications are proposed. Based on the guidelines, using commercially available abrupt junction silicon varactors, a tunable matching network is built and measured. The matching network is then used for load modulation of a 1-GHz 7-W class-E LDMOS PA. Static measurements of the load modulated PA show that the power-added efficiency of the PA is improved by an absolute value of 10% at 10-dB backoff. This promising result proves, for the first time, the feasibility of load modulation techniques for high-power applications in the gigahertz frequency range.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909498/04814544.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Varactor-Based Tunable Matching Networks for Dynamic Load Modulation of High Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814544/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Varactor-Based Tunable Matching Networks for Dynamic Load Modulation of High Power Amplifiers","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628399","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814544/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Varactor-Based Tunable Matching Networks for Dynamic Load Modulation of High Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"57tmtt05-hnemati-part1-2017257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075309S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4909498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4909498","articleId":"4814544","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814546,"authors":[{"name":"Yonina C.

This statement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the entire available bandwidth. In practice, many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate sampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces, generated by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n kernels with period \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>\n .

Our approach combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite counterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the framework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms developed in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in contrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model exists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature on CS to the analog domain.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2020750","startPage":"2986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5165248/04814546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2020750","endPage":"2997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing of Analog Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing of Analog Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces","volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4814546/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10764112","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing of Analog Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces","sourcePdf":"tsp-eldar-2020750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108725S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5165248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5165248","articleId":"4814546","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4814547,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhard Feger","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radarsensors, Institute of Communications and Information Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909498/4814547/4814547-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reinhard Feger (S'08) was born in Kufstein, Austria, in 1980.

For this reason, it is desirable to reduce the envelope fluctuations of the transmitted signals. The use of clipping techniques combined with frequency-domain filtering was shown to be an effective way of reducing the envelope fluctuations (and, inherently, the PMEPR) of DS-CDMA signals, while maintaining the spectral occupation of the corresponding conventional DS-CDMA signals. To avoid PMEPR regrowth effects, the clipping and filtering operations can be repeated several times. However, the performance degradation due to nonlinear distortion effects on the transmitted signals can be relatively high, particularly when a very low PMEPR is intended (e.g., when a low clipping level and several iterations are adopted). This can particularly be serious if different powers are assigned to different spreading codes. To avoid significant performance degradation in these situations, we consider an improved receiver where there is an iterative estimation and cancellation of nonlinear distortion effects. Our performance results show that the proposed receiver allows significant performance improvements after just a few iterations, even when we have strong nonlinear distortion effects.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04814549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","startPage":"4169","endPage":"4181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Detection of Multicode DS-CDMA Signals With Strong Nonlinear Distortion Effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Detection of Multicode DS-CDMA Signals With Strong Nonlinear Distortion Effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903038","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Detection of Multicode DS-CDMA Signals With Strong Nonlinear Distortion Effects","sourcePdf":"tvt-silva-2020907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112657S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4814549","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814553,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Preradovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909499/4814553/4814553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stevan Preradovic (S'08) was born in Sombor, Serbia.

Despite their advantages, the large number of components required increases the fault probability. Among the multilevel topologies, the cascade multicell converter presents advantages when operating under internal fault conditions, due to its high modularity. Previous works proposed to compensate the unbalanced operation due to a fault by changing the canonical fundamental output phase shift to precalculated angles, depending on the fault condition. This solution assumes that, if the maximum output phase voltage on each leg is used, the maximum line-to-line voltage will be at a maximum as well. This paper shows how this assumption is not always valid and presents the optimum angles and modulation indexes that must be used in order to obtain the maximum balanced load voltages.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2019771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04814561.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2019771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","startPage":"2697","endPage":"2703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Operation of Cascade Multicell Converters Under Fault Condition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extended Operation of Cascade Multicell Converters Under Fault Condition","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736247","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814561/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Operation of Cascade Multicell Converters Under Fault Condition","sourcePdf":"tie-lezana-2019771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07822S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4814561","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4814569,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4897624/4814569/4814569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhao was born in China.

However, research so far on multifingered robot control has assumed that the kinematics and contact points of the fingers are known exactly. In many applications of multifingered robot hands, the kinematics and contact points of the fingers are uncertain and structures of the Jacobian matrices are unknown. In this paper, we propose an adaptive neural network (NN) Jacobian controller for multifingered robot hand with uncertainties in kinematics, Jacobian matrices, and dynamics. It is shown that using NNs, the uniform ultimate boundedness of the position error can be achieved in the presence of the uncertainties. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10601765","pubMedId":"19369155","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4814569/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Control of Multifingered Robot Hands Using Visual Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Control of Multifingered Robot Hands Using Visual Feedback","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhao-2012127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143463S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4897624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4897624","articleId":"4814569","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814572,"authors":[{"name":"Allen Yi-Zhi Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Allen Yi-Zhi","lastName":"Xu","id":"38188441000"},{"name":"Edward K.

In this paper, we propose a threshold-based coherent TOA estimation scheme for impulse radio-based ultrawideband (UWB) systems. The scheme uses a dedicated ranging sequence with a good cross-correlation property and a search-back process that considers the count of threshold crossings to find the leading edge of the received signal. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the optimal threshold that restrains the mean absolute error.

For the first time, reliability and circuit-failure behaviors under analog and mixed-signal operating conditions are simulated and analyzed with a high-speed Flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuit developed in advanced CMOS technology. We demonstrate how the failure rate at circuit-level integrating multiple failure mechanisms is determined as a function of operating voltage and temperature. The results show that the dominant failure mechanism and failure rate could be changed by operating conditions. Based on the complete analysis of the ADC circuit operating under normal condition, negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) is the predominant failure mechanism in normal analog and mixed-signal applications, and failure rate increases with the elevated temperature. The impact of NBTI on circuit performance is addressed in detail. Two different types of degradation caused by NBTI are investigated: output voltage degradation and delay. The simulation results are verified by the field data. After exploring the reliability behaviors, a design for reliability methodologies is proposed and classified into two categories: device and circuit levels. This paper shreds light for the circuit life estimation and further reliable design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10847267","htmlLink":"/document/4814578/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Simulation and Circuit-Failure Analysis in Analog and Mixed-Signal Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Simulation and Circuit-Failure Analysis in Analog and Mixed-Signal Applications","sourcePdf":"tdmr-yan-2020740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065048S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"5226698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5226698","articleId":"4814578","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814581,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zhang","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4814581/4814581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghong Zhang (M'09) received the B.Eng.

The goal is to provide satisfactory quality of service (QoS) to both real-time and non-real-time applications, despite the rapid variations in available resources caused by the activities of the primary users. The dynamic nature of the available spectrum gives rise to two resource allocation issues: 1) problem feasibility and 2) false urgency. To solve the problem-feasibility issue, which arises when resources are insufficient to meet all user QoS requirements, we adopt a goal-programming approach. The false-urgency issue that was caused by variations in available system resources is effectively avoided by a proposed rate-requirement calculation mechanism based on the status of the packets in queue and system resource availability. Simulation results show that the proposed cross-layer resource-allocation algorithm for CR systems performs better than existing algorithms that were designed for multiuser OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04814581.pdf","startPage":"4605","endPage":"4619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2020801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2020801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation for Mixed Services in Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Chromium","OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Quality of service","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Physical layer","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mathematical programming","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","quality of service","QoS","goal-programming approach","rate-requirement calculation mechanism","system resource availability","cross-layer resource-allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","cross layer","goal programming","multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","non real time (NRT)","OFDMA","real time (RT)","resource allocation (RA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation for Mixed Services in Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4814581/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903041","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Resource Allocation for Mixed Services in Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2020801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094786S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4814581","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814582,"authors":[{"name":"U-Xuan Tan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["U-Xuan Tan (S'07), photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"U-Xuan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37299514100"},{"name":"Win Tun Latt","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Win Tun Latt (S'08), photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Win Tun","lastName":"Latt","id":"37571986400"},{"name":"Cheng Yap Shee","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Cheng Yap Shee photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Cheng Yap","lastName":"Shee","id":"37583719000"},{"name":"Cameron N.

Their intrinsic hysteretic behavior makes control difficult. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator can model hysteresis well, albeit a major inadequacy: the inverse operator does not exist when the hysteretic curve gradient is not positive definite, i.e., ill condition occurs when slope is negative. An inevitable tradeoff between modeling accuracy and inversion stability exists. The hysteretic modeling improves with increasing number of play operators. But as the piecewise continuous interval of each operator reduces, the model tends to be ill-conditioned, especially at the turning points. Similar ill-conditioned situation arises when these actuators move heavy loads or operate at high frequency. This paper proposes an extended PI operator to map hysteresis to a domain where inversion is well behaved. The inverse weights are then evaluated to determine the inverse hysteresis model for the feedforward controller. For illustration purpose, a piezoelectric actuator is used.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2008.2009936","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5230370/04814582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2008.2009936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230370","startPage":"598","endPage":"605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedforward Controller of Ill-Conditioned Hysteresis Using Singularity-Free Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward Controller of Ill-Conditioned Hysteresis Using Singularity-Free Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847458","pubMedId":"19936032","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814582/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward Controller of Ill-Conditioned Hysteresis Using Singularity-Free Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model","sourcePdf":"tmech-tan-2009936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077826S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5230370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5230370","articleId":"4814582","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814583,"authors":[{"name":"Shaun P.

Novel and systematic design methodology leading to size miniaturization is proposed. By considering all possible dual-band phase transitions of the constituent transmission lines of the directional couplers, this design approach ensures the compactness of the hybrids and reduces footprint size significantly compared to the previously exhibited standard transmission-line- and CRLH-based hybrids. The proposed dual-band 90deg and 180deg hybrids achieve 10% and 43.7% size reduction, respectively, compared to conventional microstrip couplers in the lower band of the dual-frequency operation. In addition, the fabricated 180deg hybrid is shown to have enhanced bandwidth performance in both isolation and 3-dB magnitude balance. The combination of either of the proposed couplers with the proposed dual-band CRLH-based delay line enables antenna pattern diversity with distinct beam patterns in dual bands. This serves as an effective dual-band beam pattern diversity system when connected to the antenna array. Moreover, the isolation improvement by cascading the antenna array with this assembly was measured experimentally at two operational bands: 22.7 dB at 1 GHz and 10 dB at 2 GHz.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909498","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909498/04814654.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized Dual-Band Directional Couplers Using Composite Right/Left-Handed Transmission Structures and Their Applications in Beam Pattern Diversity Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized Dual-Band Directional Couplers Using Composite Right/Left-Handed Transmission Structures and Their Applications in Beam Pattern Diversity Systems","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628387","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized Dual-Band Directional Couplers Using Composite Right/Left-Handed Transmission Structures and Their Applications in Beam Pattern Diversity Systems","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chi-part1-2017350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033411S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4909498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"52","articleId":"4814654","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814656,"authors":[{"name":"Ally Y.

A fully realistic heterogeneous human body model and an actual elevator size were employed. The nonuniform mesh finite-difference time-domain technique and a supercomputer were employed to obtain the SAR and other important parameters. The mobile phone was modeled as a lambda/2 dipole antenna placed at a distance of 16 mm from the head. For computations, operating frequencies of 900, 1500, and 2000 MHz with transmitting power of 250 mW were used. Computed results show that the peak spatial-average 10-g SAR depends on the position of the passenger and the antenna against the elevator walls. We observed a substantial increase in the whole-body average SAR and peak 10-g SAR values of the passenger in the elevator over their respective free-space values. However, the maximum values obtained do meet the basic restrictions described in the international RF safety guidelines. For example, the maximum values of the whole-body average and peak spatial-average SAR were 4.4% and 78% of the international RF safety guideline, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909498/04814656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909498","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specific Absorption Rates of Anatomically Realistic Human Models Exposed to RF Electromagnetic Fields From Mobile Phones Used in Elevators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Specific Absorption Rates of Anatomically Realistic Human Models Exposed to RF Electromagnetic Fields From Mobile Phones Used in Elevators","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628388","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814656/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specific Absorption Rates of Anatomically Realistic Human Models Exposed to RF Electromagnetic Fields From Mobile Phones Used in Elevators","sourcePdf":"tmtt-simba-part1-2017354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072272S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4909498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4909498","articleId":"4814656","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814659,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lyang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/4850389/4814659/4814659-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Lyang Hwang (AM'96\u2013M'07\u2013SM'08) received the B.E. degree in aeronautical engineering from Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1981 and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Tatung Institute of Technology (or Tatung University), Taipei, in 1986 and 1990, respectively.","From 1990 to 2006, he was with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tatung Institute of Technology, where he was engaged in teaching and research in the area of servo control and control of manufacturing systems and robotic systems and was a Professor of mechanical engineering from 1996 to 2006.

In order to do so, two strategies are employed in this paper. One is to control the bike's center of gravity (CG), and the other is to control the angle of the bike's steering handle. As in general, the control of the CG applies a pendulum. An additional factor is the lean angle with respect to the gravitational direction of the bicycle in motion. In this total, the proposed system produces three outputs that will affect the dynamic balance of an electrical bicycle: the bike's pendulum angle, lean angle, and steering angle. Based on the data of input-output, two scaling factors are first employed to normalize the sliding surface and its derivative. According to the concept of the if-then rule, an appropriate rule table for the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i>\nth subsystem is obtained. Then, the output scaling factor based on Lyapunov stability is determined. The purpose of using the proposed fuzzy sliding-mode underactuated control (FSMUAC) is to deal with the huge uncertainties of a bicycle system often caused by different ground conditions and gusts of wind. Finally, the simulations for the electrical bicycle in motion under ordinary PID control, modified proportional-derivative control, and FSMUAC are compared to judge the efficiency of our proposed control method.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2004349","startPage":"658","endPage":"670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2008.2004349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4850389/04814659.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Underactuated Control for Autonomous Dynamic Balance of an Electrical Bicycle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814659/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Underactuated Control for Autonomous Dynamic Balance of an Electrical Bicycle","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4814659/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10588895","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Underactuated Control for Autonomous Dynamic Balance of an Electrical Bicycle","sourcePdf":"tcst-hwang-2004349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20364S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4850389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4850389","articleId":"4814659","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4814662,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4814662/4814662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Wu (M'05) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1988, 1990, and 2008, respectively.","Since 1990, she has been with the Institute of Manufacturing Engineering, Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, as an Associate Professor.

Based on the tracking and disturbance rejection requirements for NCTP, the controller is designed through a combined active disturbance rejection control and feedforward arrangement by exploiting the unique disturbance estimation and compensation concept and the known reference acceleration signals. In such a design framework, an extended state observer is applied to estimate and compensate for the variant dynamics of the system, nonlinearly variable cutting load, and other uncertainties. Then, a simple proportional integral controller and the acceleration feedforward design produce the control law. To quantify the controller performances, the transfer function description of the controller is derived, and the dynamic stiffness and tracking have been analyzed. By defining the vector margin variation rate, the effects of the plant parameter variations on closed-loop stability are also addressed. Experimental results of machining the first- and second-order oval profiles demonstrate that the tracking error is less than 3 mum for different cutting parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814662/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736226","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Precision Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Noncircular Turning Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Precision Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Noncircular Turning Process","sourcePdf":"tie-wu-2019774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077422S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4814662","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4814663,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4814663/4814663-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Jin Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Daejin University, Pocheon, Korea, in 2000, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering.","His research interests include multilevel converters and their applications."]},"firstName":"Tae-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280612700"},{"name":"Woo-Cheol Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Electronic Technology Institute, Hankyong National University, Ansung, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4814663/4814663-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Woo-Cheol Lee received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1987, 1989, and 2001, respectively.","From 1988 to 1998, he was a Senior Researcher with the R&D Institute, Hyosung Industries Company, Ltd., Seoul.

Which operation mode should be selected (e.g., continuous or discontinuous operation)? How many interleaved boost cells are advantageous? Which switching frequency should be selected? What is the optimum number of EMI input filter stages? Which semiconductor technology should be chosen? All these issues have a significant influence on the converter efficiency and power density. In this paper, the aforementioned questions are addressed for exemplary specifications of the PFC (300-W output power, 400-V output voltage, and 230-V mains voltage), whereby the focus in the design is mainly put on very high power density. As a result, different design points are identified and comparatively evaluated. By considering different aspects such as volume, losses, capacitor lifetime, and also cost issues (e.g., by additional current sensors or expensive silicon carbide devices), a dual-interleaved PFC operated in discontinuous conduction mode at 200 kHz is selected. With an experimental prototype, a superior power density of 5.5 kW/L and a system efficiency of 96.4% are achieved, which is close to the values predicted by the design procedure. Furthermore, measurements verify a near-unity power factor (PF = 99.7%) and the compliance with electromagnetic compatibility conducted noise emission standards. Finally, it is investigated to which extent the power density could be further increased by an integration of the input filter in the PCB.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2020074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04814669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2020074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","startPage":"2574","endPage":"2587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Design and Optimization of a High-Power-Density Single-Phase Boost PFC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Design and Optimization of a High-Power-Density Single-Phase Boost PFC","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736243","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814669/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Design and Optimization of a High-Power-Density Single-Phase Boost PFC","sourcePdf":"tie-raggl-2020074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132137S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4814669","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4814682,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo B.

Our calculations show that the amplifier optical gain can be greatly enhanced through p-type doping where the doping concentration should not exceed the certain level. We find that increasing the acceptor concentration increases the unsaturated optical gain but at the same time decreases the saturation density and the effective relaxation lifetime. Also our calculation reveals that the use of p-type doping will be associated with an increase in the transparency current where the increase in the transparency current depends on the incident photon energy. On the other hand, we find that it is possible to increase the saturation density and enhance the linearity of the SOA by using n-type doping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814688/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"June15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10757636","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Doping on the Optical Characteristics of Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Doping on the Optical Characteristics of Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jlt-qasaimeh-2005589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083122S","chronDate":"June15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5067409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5067409","articleId":"4814688","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4814699,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

The method uses a recently developed time-frequency spectral estimation method, variable-frequency complex demodulation (VFCDM), to identify frequency modulation (FM) of the photoplethysmogram waveform. This FM has a measurable periodicity, which provides an estimate of the respiration period. We compared the performance of VFCDM to the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and autoregressive (AR) model approaches. The CWT method also utilizes the respiratory sinus arrhythmia effect as represented by either FM or AM to estimate respiratory rates. Both CWT and AR model methods have been previously shown to provide reasonably good estimates of breathing rates that are in the normal range (12-26 breaths/min). However, to our knowledge, breathing rates higher than 26 breaths/min and the real-time performance of these algorithms are yet to be tested. Our analysis based on 15 healthy subjects reveals that the VFCDM method provides the best results in terms of accuracy (smaller median error), consistency (smaller interquartile range of the median value), and computational efficiency (less than 0.3 s on 1 min of data using a MATLAB implementation) to extract breathing rates that varied from 12-36 breaths/min.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2019766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5165131/04814699.pdf","startPage":"2054","endPage":"2063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2019766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Respiratory Rate From Photoplethysmogram Data Using Time\u2013Frequency Spectral Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814699/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Respiratory Rate From Photoplethysmogram Data Using Time\u2013Frequency Spectral Estimation","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10763978","pubMedId":"19369147","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814699/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Respiratory Rate From Photoplethysmogram Data Using Time\u2013Frequency Spectral Estimation","sourcePdf":"tbme-chon-2019766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066614S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5165131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5165131","articleId":"4814699","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814707,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hou Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Technology, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, China","Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5156189/4814707/4814707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Hou Zheng was born in Shandong, China, in 1973.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown advantages over other conventional clustering techniques. Nonetheless, there is still considerable room for improving the performance of NMF. To this end, in this paper, gene selection and explicitly enforcing sparseness are introduced into the factorization process. Particularly, independent component analysis is employed to select a subset of genes so that the effect of irrelevant or noisy genes can be reduced. The NMF and its extensions, sparse NMF and NMF with sparseness constraint, are then used for tumor clustering on the selected genes. A series of elaborate experiments are performed by varying the number of clusters and the number of selected genes to evaluate the cooperation between different gene selection settings and NMF-based clustering. Finally, the experiments on three representative gene expression datasets demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve better clustering results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tumor Clustering Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Gene Selection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2018115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5156189/04814707.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2018115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Tumor Clustering Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Gene Selection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4814707/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10773239","pubMedId":"19369170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tumor Clustering Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Gene Selection","sourcePdf":"titb-huang-2018115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119124S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5156189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5156189","articleId":"4814707","onlineDate":"14 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814710,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5068840/4814710/4814710-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Hung Chen (S\u201907) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1979.

This ldquomode-field matchedrdquo center-launching technique enables us to excite only the fundamental mode in the MMF and, consequently, avoid the inherent limitations imposed by the differential mode delay. We realize this mode-field matched center-launching technique simply by fusion-splicing a single-mode fiber (SMF) pigtailed transmitter to the MMF. The splicing condition is optimized to expand the core of SMF slightly so that it can match the mode field distribution of the fundamental mode of MMF. The results show that, by using this launching technique, we can achieve the transmission characteristics similar to SMF and drastically increase the bandwidth-distance product of MMF. For demonstrations, we have successfully transmitted 10- and 40-Gb/s signals over 12.2 and 3.7 km of MMF, respectively, without using any dispersion compensation techniques. We have also evaluated the robustness of the MMF link implemented by using the proposed launching technique against the mechanical perturbations such as the lateral offset between fiber connectors, fiber bending, and fiber shaking.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2005040","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814721/04814734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2005040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814721","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Multimode Fiber Transmission by Using Mode-Field Matched Center-Launching Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Multimode Fiber Transmission by Using Mode-Field Matched Center-Launching Technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10572880","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814734/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Multimode Fiber Transmission by Using Mode-Field Matched Center-Launching Technique","sourcePdf":"jlt-sim-2005040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070182S","chronDate":"April15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4814721","articleId":"4814734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814735,"authors":[{"name":"Hector E.

Hereafter, it is referred to as F-PolSK. The novel F-PolSK-OCDMA system has been accurately analyzed taking into account the presence of 1) optical amplified spontaneous emission noise; 2) electronic receiver noise; 3) photo-diode shot-noise; and 4) multiple-access interference (MAI). The application of the optical tapped-delay lines at the receiver as a CDMA-decoder has also been investigated. The evaluation of 2-D array modulation in conjunction with OCDMA indicates that the binary combination of this hybrid scheme enhances the overall system performance. The results reveal that the proposed architecture can easily accommodate greater number of users and consume less power as compared with previous schemes. On the other hand, in polarization modulation since the optical beam power is constant, the system has immunity against the self- and cross-phase modulations. Besides, the system security is much enhanced due to 2-D advanced modulation in optical domain.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2005042","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814721/04814741.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2005042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incoherent Two-Dimensional Array Modulation Transceiver for Photonic CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814741/","displayDocTitle":"Incoherent Two-Dimensional Array Modulation Transceiver for Photonic CDMA","volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10572883","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814741/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incoherent Two-Dimensional Array Modulation Transceiver for Photonic CDMA","sourcePdf":"jlt-karbassian-2005042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064469S","chronDate":"April15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4814721","articleId":"4814741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814742,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan B.

filters, optical microwave and millimeter-wave signal generators, and optical subcarrier frequency up-converters. An optical phase-modulated signal can be converted to an intensity-modulated signal in a dispersive optical fiber. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of optical phase modulation, for linear applications such as microwave signal distribution and filtering, the modulation index should be kept small to minimize the unwanted modulation nonlinearity. However, for nonlinear applications such as microwave frequency multiplication and subcarrier frequency upconversion, the modulation index should be large to maximize the frequency multiplication and upconversion efficiency. In this paper, for the first time to our knowledge, we develop a thorough theoretical framework for the characterization of phase-modulation-based MWP systems, in which the phase modulation to intensity modulation conversion is realized using a dispersive fiber. Analytical models for the distributions of single-tone and two-tone microwave signals and for microwave frequency multiplication and subcarrier frequency upconversion are developed, which are verified by numerical simulations. The analytical models for single-tone and two-tone transmissions are further confirmed by experiments. The developed analytical models provide an accurate mathematical tool in designing phase-modulation-based MWP systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Models for Phase-Modulation-Based Microwave Photonic Systems With Phase Modulation to Intensity Modulation Conversion Using a Dispersive Device","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2004595","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814719/04814746.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2004595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814719","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Models for Phase-Modulation-Based Microwave Photonic Systems With Phase Modulation to Intensity Modulation Conversion Using a Dispersive Device","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"March1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10572866","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Models for Phase-Modulation-Based Microwave Photonic Systems With Phase Modulation to Intensity Modulation Conversion Using a Dispersive Device","sourcePdf":"jlt-jyao-2004595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057006S","chronDate":"March1,  2009","isNumber":"4814719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"103","articleId":"4814746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814754,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In addition to the mathematical description of the proposed carrier recovery algorithm also a possible hardware-efficient implementation in a parallelized system is presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations for square 4-QAM (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM.

This results in decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consequently impaired performance. In this paper, the error performance of the FSO using a subcarrier intensity modulation (SIM) based on a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) scheme in a clear but turbulent atmosphere is presented. To evaluate the system error performance in turbulence regimes from weak to strong, the probability density function (pdf) of the received irradiance after traversing the atmosphere is modelled using the gamma-gamma distribution while the negative exponential distribution is used to model turbulence in the saturation region and beyond. The effect of turbulence induced irradiance fluctuation is mitigated using spatial diversity at the receiver. With reference to the single photodetector case, up to 12 dB gain in the electrical SNR is predicted with two direct detection PIN photodetectors in strong atmospheric turbulence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2009","volume":"27","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10572888","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April15, 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814759/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BPSK Subcarrier Intensity Modulated Free-Space Optical Communications in Atmospheric Turbulence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BPSK Subcarrier Intensity Modulated Free-Space Optical Communications in Atmospheric Turbulence","sourcePdf":"jlt-popoola-2004950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0852S","chronDate":"April15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"374","xplore-issue":"4814721","articleId":"4814759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4814762,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred Feldster","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Alfred Feldster photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Feldster","id":"37688185100"},{"name":"Yuval P.

A bottom up approach is taken in which an example of a specification of a feature of cognitive radio in a selected language is shown, followed by an example of a feature that cannot be expressed in the language and the identification of a capability that needs to be added to the language in order to cover the identified gap in the expressiveness. Following this pattern, we start with a language based on description logics and add the capability of expressing rules, then functions, and finally behavioral aspects. The running example used in this paper - conveying the description of a component to be synthesized by another radio - covers two major aspects of a cognitive radio: an ability to express own capabilities and an ability to interoperate with other cognitive radios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","volume":"97","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10587058","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814772/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Language Issues for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language Issues for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"jproc-kokar-2013028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110844S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4814763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4814763","articleId":"4814772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814773,"authors":[{"name":"Mihaela van der Schaar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"van der Schaar","id":"37285114700"},{"name":"Fangwen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fangwen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37302002900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"4814773","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Stochastic processes","Resource management","Games","Quality of service","Streaming media","Interference","Bandwidth","Autonomous agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","stochastic games","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum access games","strategic learning","cognitive radio networks","delay-critical applications","dynamic spectrum access","stochastic game framework","wireless resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel access games","cognitive radios","knowledge-driven wireless networking","multiuser wireless communication","spectrum access","stochastic games","strategic learning","wireless resource markets"]}],"abstract":"With the current proliferation of high bandwidth and delay-sensitive multimedia applications and services, each wireless user will try to maximize its utility by acquiring as much spectrum resources as possible unless a preemptive mechanism exists in the network. Thus, emerging solutions for dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks will need to adopt market-based approaches in order to effectively regulate the available resources. In this paper, we show how various centralized and decentralized spectrum access markets can be designed based on a stochastic game framework, where wireless users (also referred to as secondary users) can compete over time for the dynamically available transmission opportunities (spectrum ldquoholesrdquo). When operating in such spectrum access ldquomarkets,rdquo wireless users become selfish, autonomous agents that strategically interact in order to acquire the necessary spectrum opportunities. We also show how wireless users can successfully compete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrum opportunities, given the experienced dynamics in the wireless network, by optimizing both their external actions (e.g., the resource bids, power and channel used for transmission, etc.) and their internal actions (e.g., the modulation schemes, etc.). To determine their optimal actions in an informationally decentralized setting, users will need to learn and model directly or indirectly the other users' responses to their external actions. We studied the outcome of various dynamic interactions among self-interested wireless users possessing different knowledge and determine that the proposed framework can lead to multiuser communication systems that achieve new measures of efficiency, rationality and fairness. Lastly, our illustrative results show that the presented game-theoretic solution for wireless resource management enables users deploying enhanced (ldquosmarterrdquo) learning and communication algorithms and being able to make efficient use of the spectrum resources can derive higher utilities. This presents the designers of wireless devices and systems with important incentives to endow their next-generation products and services with enhanced capabilities to gather information, learn, and strategically compete for resources in the emerging spectrum resource markets made possible by the cognitive radio network technologies.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013036","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4814763/04814773.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013036","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"720","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Access Games and Strategic Learning in Cognitive Radio Networks for Delay-Critical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814773","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Access Games and Strategic Learning in Cognitive Radio Networks for Delay-Critical Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814773/","volume":"97","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572756","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Access Games and Strategic Learning in Cognitive Radio Networks for Delay-Critical Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-vanderschaar-2013036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045954S","chronDate":"April  2009","isNumber":"4814763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"66","articleId":"4814773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814774,"authors":[{"name":"Preston F.

For this method, we also introduce an equivalent form of the moment generating function, that avoids the singularity for eigenvalues equal to zero, and derive an alternative expansion where signal and noise are expanded on the same orthonormal basis.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814801/04814807.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.927770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.927770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Error Probability Evaluation in Lightwave Systems With Optical Amplification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Stimulated emission","Fourier series","Bit error rate","Optical filters","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Frequency domain analysis","Computational efficiency","Signal generators","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","Fourier transform optics","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability evaluation","lightwave systems","optical amplification","time domain","frequency domain","Fourier series","Karhunen-Loeve series expansion","optical filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier noise","direct detection","error probability evaluation","Karhunen-Lo\u00c9ve expansion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Error Probability Evaluation in Lightwave Systems With Optical Amplification","volume":"27","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4814807/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10572893","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Error Probability Evaluation in Lightwave Systems With Optical Amplification","sourcePdf":"27jlt06-forestieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138829S","chronDate":"March15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4814801","articleId":"4814807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814809,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Giorgetti","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4814801/4814809/4814809-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessio Giorgetti received the Laurea degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree from the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2006.","In 2007, he was a Visiting Scholar at the Centre for Photonic Systems, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

The resource reservation can be blocked due to lack of available resources (forward blocking) or due to resource contentions (backward blocking). In wavelength-routed networks, the backward blocking is the predominant blocking contribution, when traffic load is low or highly-dynamic and when lightpath restoration takes place. To reduce the backward blocking, the paper proposes two label preference (LP) schemes compliant with RSVP-TE message exchanges. LP schemes provide the destination node with a label identifying the preferred wavelength to reserve. The preferred label is computed in a distributed way during the forward signaling phase, with the objective of assigning disjoint wavelengths to reservation attempts that may contend the resources. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to other schemes, LP schemes are effective in reducing the backward blocking during both lightpath provisioning and restoration, without negatively impacting the forward blocking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Label Preference Schemes for Lightpath Provisioning and Restoration in Distributed GMPLS Networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.917380","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814801/04814809.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.917380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Label Preference Schemes for Lightpath Provisioning and Restoration in Distributed GMPLS Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4814809/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"March15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10572894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Label Preference Schemes for Lightpath Provisioning and Restoration in Distributed GMPLS Networks","sourcePdf":"27jlt06-giorgetti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062101S","chronDate":"March15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4814801","articleId":"4814809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814810,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew D.

However, the rtPS service intrinsically has high latency, which makes it not applicable to real-time traffic transport. In this paper, we present a novel traffic scheduling algorithm for hybrid fiber coax (HFC) networks based on DOCSIS that aims to provide QoS for real-time VBR video transmissions. The novel characteristics of this algorithm, as compared to those described in published literatures, include 1) it predicts the bandwidth requirements for future traffic using a novel traffic predictor designed to provide simple yet accurate online prediction; and 2) it takes the attributes of physical (PHY) layer, media access control (MAC) layer and application layer into consideration. In addition, the proposed traffic scheduling algorithm is completely compatible with the DOCSIS specification and does not require any protocol changes. We analyze the performance of the proposed traffic predictor and traffic scheduling algorithm using real-life MPEG video traces. Simulation results indicate that 1) the proposed traffic predictor significantly outperforms previously published techniques with respect to the prediction error and 2) compared with several existing scheduling algorithms, the proposed traffic scheduling algorithm surpasses other mechanisms in terms of channel utilization, buffer usage, packet delay, and packet loss rate.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.926954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814801","startPage":"639","endPage":"654","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814801/04814812.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.926954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Traffic Scheduling for Real Time VBR MPEG Video Transmission Over DOCSIS-Based HFC Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Hybrid fiber coaxial cables","Scheduling algorithm","Traffic control","Quality of service","Job shop scheduling","Delay","Communication system traffic control","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","scheduling","telecommunication channels","telecommunication traffic","video communication","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-over-cable service interface specifications","scheduling service","real-time polling service","quality of service transmission","real-time variable bit rate videos","traffic scheduling algorithm","hybrid fiber coax networks","video transmissions","media access control layer","protocol changes","scheduling algorithms","channel utilization","buffer usage","packet delay","packet loss rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOCSIS","HFC","MAC","real-time VBR video","QoS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Traffic Scheduling for Real Time VBR MPEG Video Transmission Over DOCSIS-Based HFC Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4814812/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10572897","publicationDate":"March15, 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Traffic Scheduling for Real Time VBR MPEG Video Transmission Over DOCSIS-Based HFC Networks","sourcePdf":"27jlt06-kuo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05484S","chronDate":"March15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4814801","articleId":"4814812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4814816,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Puerto Leguizamon","affiliation":["ITEAM Research Institute, Optical and Quantum Communications Group, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Gustavo Puerto Leguizam\u00f3n was born in Sogamoso, Colombia, in 1978.

The implemented functionalities allows the routing and forwarding of optical packets at 10 Gb/s based on the information conveyed in the 18 GHz-subcarrier multiplexed (SCM) label at 155 Mb/s. Specific functions of the optical packet switching demonstrator such as label extraction and rewriting are based on high-performance fiber Bragg grating filters (FBG) whereas semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based wavelength conversion allows payload 2R regeneration. Advanced aspects implemented in the high speed electronic control unit such as traffic shaping, multicast, and for the first time to our knowledge, a contention resolution algorithm with priority processing are thoroughly described in this paper. This paper also presents simulations exploring the effect of these advanced features in the global performance of an optical packet switched network. In particular, we found that the contention resolution algorithm based on parallel converters with 16 wavelengths contributes to improve up to four orders of magnitude the packet loss rate for low traffic loads whereas the improvement from traffic shaping policies was of 1 order of magnitude for both low and medium traffic loads. Along with the experimental results, the feasibility of the approach as the basis for the next generation internet networks is demonstrated. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprotocol label switching","Optical packet switching","Next generation networking","IP networks","Telecommunication traffic","Optical wavelength conversion","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Routing","High speed optical techniques","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","Internet","optical fibre communication","optical fibre filters","optical repeaters","optical switches","optical wavelength conversion","packet switching","semiconductor optical amplifiers","subcarrier multiplexing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier multiplexed label swapping","optical packet switching","Internet","IST-LABELS","routing","packet forwarding","fiber Bragg grating filters","semiconductor optical amplifier","SOA","wavelength conversion","2R regeneration","contention resolution algorithm","parallel converters","traffic shaping","multicast","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bit rate 155 Mbit/s","frequency 18 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical label swapping","optical packet switching networks","subcarrier multiplexing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.926951","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4814801/04814816.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.926951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Subcarrier Multiplexed Label Swapping in Optical Packet Switching Nodes for Next Generation Internet Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Subcarrier Multiplexed Label Swapping in Optical Packet Switching Nodes for Next Generation Internet Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814816/","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"March15, 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4814816/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10572900","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Subcarrier Multiplexed Label Swapping in Optical Packet Switching Nodes for Next Generation Internet Networks","sourcePdf":"27jlt06-puerto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103899S","chronDate":"March15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4814801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4814801","articleId":"4814816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4814823,"authors":[{"name":"Bih-Chyun Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4814801/4814823/4814823-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bih-Chyun Yeh was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1973.

However, the capability of conventional ROADMs is limited to handling wavelength paths, and it does not support fine granularity in add/drop multiplexing of packets. Recently, we have proposed and demonstrated a packet-selective ROADM that combines an acoustooptic wavelength-tunable filter (AOTF) and an optical packet ADM (PADM) using optical code label processing. It provides more efficient utilization of wavelengths than conventional ROADMs. However, the bit rate of the demonstration was limited up to 10 Gbit/s. In this paper, we newly develop a label-selectivity-enhanced optical en/decoder, which allows the optical label recognition with 40-Gbit/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) data packets, and a wide pass-band AOTF for 40-Gbit/s signals.

The optical interfaces to the chip are provided by 16-channel photodiode (PD) and VCSEL arrays that are directly flip-chip soldered to the CMOS IC. The substrate emitting/illuminated VCSEL/PD arrays operate at 985 nm and include integrated lenses. The complete transceivers are low-cost, low-profile, highly integrated assemblies that are compatible with conventional chip packaging technology such as direct flip-chip soldering to organic circuit boards. In addition, the packaging approach, dense hybrid integration, readily scales to higher channel counts, supporting future massively parallel optical data buses. All transmitter and receiver channels operate at speeds up to 15 Gb/s for an aggregate bidirectional data rate of 240 Gb/s. Interchannel crosstalk was extensively characterized and the dominant source was found to be between receiver channels, with a maximum sensitivity penalty of 1 dB measured at 10 Gb/s for a victim channel completely surrounded by active aggressor channels. The transceiver measures 3.25times5.25 mm and consumes 2.15 W of power with all channels fully operational.

Several phase estimation methods are numerically modeled: the maximum a posteriori (MAP) phase estimate, decision directed estimate, power law-Wiener filter estimate and power law-PLL estimate. An asynchronous coherent detection case is also modeled. The phase estimates are evaluated with respect to their tolerance of finite laser linewidth and their suitability for implementation in a parallel digital processor. Laser phase noise causes transmission system performance to be degraded by excess bit errors and cycle slips. The optimal phase estimate is the MAP estimate, and it is also included as a baseline. The power law-Wiener filter phase estimate is found to perform only marginally worse than the MAP estimate. It must be recast using a look-ahead computation to be implemented in a parallel digital processor, and the impact is investigated of the increase in the number of computations required. Differential logical detection is often used to reduce the impact of cycle slip events, and the implications of this operation on the bit error rate are studied.

This can be utilized for constrained-power control to satisfy specific goals (such as fairness, aggregate throughput optimization, or trading off between these two goals). For each one of the above goals, the dynamic price for each user is also analytically obtained. In a centralized (base station) price setting, users should inform the base station of their path gains and their maximum transmit-powers. In a distributed price setting, for each goal, an algorithm for users to update their transmit-powers is also presented that converges to a unique fixed-point in which the corresponding goal is satisfied.

The current understanding is that wireless link performance in these settings is inherently unpredictable, due to multipath delay spread. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing intelligent routing techniques to achieve the best possible performance. In this paper, we are specifically interested in mesh networks in rural locations. We first present detailed measurements to show that the PHY layer in these settings is indeed stable and predictable. There is a strong correlation between the error rate and the received signal strength. We show that interference, and not multipath fading, is the primary cause of unpredictable performance. This is in sharp contrast with current widespread knowledge from prior studies. Furthermore, we corroborate our view with a fresh analysis of data presented in these prior studies. While our initial measurements focus on 802.11b, we then use two different PHY technologies as well, operating in the 2.4-GHz ISM band: 802.11g and 802.15.4. These show similar results too. Based on our results, we argue that outdoor rural mesh networks can indeed be built with the link abstraction being valid. This has several design implications, including at the MAC and routing layers, and opens up a fresh perspective on a wide range of technical issues in this domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Feasibility of the Link Abstraction in Wireless Mesh Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2013706","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4814854/04814857.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2013706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814854","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Feasibility of the Link Abstraction in Wireless Mesh Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4814857/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Feasibility of the Link Abstraction in Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-raman-2013706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086598S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4814854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4814854","articleId":"4814857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4814899,"authors":[{"name":"Jamesina J.

First, an experimental and computational study of substrate integrated waveguides (SIWs) optimized for use as ultrahigh-speed bandpass waveguiding digital interconnects is reported. The novelty of the present work resides in the successful design, fabrication, and testing of low-loss SIWs that achieve 100% relative bandwidths. These SIWs could in principle using standard circuit board technology provide bandpass operation at center frequencies approaching 200 GHz and data rates of 200 Gb/sec. These data rates meet or exceed those expected eventually for proposed silicon photonic technologies. The second FDTD modeling application involves characterizing and solving electromagnetic compatibility problems arising in ultracompact portable electronic devices, such as cellphones operating with mixes of high-speed digital and microwave signals. For this work, an ultra high-resolution full-vector 3D FDTD model of a complete compact portable electronic device is desired. In pursuit of this goal, a sample integrated circuit package is first modeled using 343 million grid cells. As future work, additional components within a sample portable electronic device will be modeled, including the circuit board and its layering details.","doi":"10.1109/IMWS.2009.4814899","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Signal Integrity and High-Speed Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Signal Integrity and High-Speed Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810924/4814891/04814899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS.2009.4814899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814891","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Modeling Applications in Ultrahigh-Speed Interconnects and Electromagnetic Compatibility of Complex Packages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Modeling Applications in Ultrahigh-Speed Interconnects and Electromagnetic Compatibility of Complex Packages","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4814899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10572108","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4814899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Modeling Applications in Ultrahigh-Speed Interconnects and Electromagnetic Compatibility of Complex Packages","confLoc":"Guadalajara, Mexico","sourcePdf":"IMWS-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080446S","chronDate":"19-20 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4810924","isNumber":"4814891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810924","xplore-issue":"4814891","articleId":"4814899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4814911,"authors":[{"name":"Qi-Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Qi-Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275873300"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406066100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2742-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2743-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4814911","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814911","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","High-speed electronics","Time domain analysis","Equivalent circuits","Equations","Integrated circuit modeling","Circuit simulation","Radio frequency","Microwave theory and techniques","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron device manufacture","high-speed integrated circuits","neural nets","state-space methods","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network techniques","high-speed electronic component modeling","state-space dynamic neural network method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EM modeling","neural network","integrated circuit (IC)","state space"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMWS.2009.4814911","pdfPath":"/iel5/4810924/4814891/04814911.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Signal Integrity and High-Speed Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Signal Integrity and High-Speed Interconnects","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS.2009.4814911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Techniques for High-Speed Electronic Component Modeling","abstract":"This paper provides an overview of neural network applications for high-speed electronic component modeling.

An important research question is how quality of service models can enabled self-healing systems. This paper presents a solution to the problem for service-oriented architectures. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) consist of a group of independent computational services, with communication between services being managed and maintained via external orchestration. We employ dynamic programming, a form of optimal control theory, to reconfigure SOA orchestration. Reconfiguration occurs when a performance constraint over the orchestration \u00ad a global service level agreement (SLA) \u00ad is violated. Currently, reconfiguration may take the form of re-directing and load-balancing of calls to services that offer equivalent functionality, but better performance. Previous experiments by Poernomo and Akzhalova involved application of optimal control theory to determine reconfiguration policies for a single service. This paper presents a significant improvement, as we now consider entire orchestrations of services. Furthermore, by utilizing dynamic programming, our new approach has the advantage of determining adaptation policies from a given discrete set of choices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Service oriented architecture","Quality of service","Runtime","Educational institutions","Optimal control","Computer science","Control theory","Engineering management","Java"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EDOCW.2008.52","publicationTitle":"2008 12th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814991/4814992/04815003.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOCW.2008.52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model driven QoS management via dynamic programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model driven QoS management via dynamic programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815003/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815003/","conferenceDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model driven QoS management via dynamic programming","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"37200087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064146S","chronDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4814991","isNumber":"4814992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814991","xplore-issue":"4814992","articleId":"4815003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4815030,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Alodib","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Alodib","id":"37658878200"},{"name":"Behzad Bordbar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Bordbar","id":"37409335500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3720-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6583"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-6605"}],"articleNumber":"4815030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815030","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Service oriented architecture","Automata","Condition monitoring","Discrete event systems","Computer architecture","Web services","Switches","Fault tolerant systems","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven architecture","fault tolerance","service oriented architectures","diagnosers","BPEL file representing services","orchestration","choreography","Oracle JDeveloper plugin tool"]}],"abstract":"In modern service oriented architectures (SoA) identifying the occurrences of failure is a crucial task, which can be carried out by the creation of diagnosers to monitor the behavior of the system. Model driven architecture (MDA) can be used to automatically create diagnosers and to integrate them into the system to identify if a failure has occurred. There are different methods of incorporating a diagnoser into a group of interacting services. One option is to modify the BPEL file representing services to incorporate the diagnoser. Another option is to implement the diagnoser as a separate service which interacts with the existing services. Moreover, the interaction between the diagnoser and the services can be either orchestration or choreography. As result, there are four options for the implementation of the diagnoser into the SoA via MDA. This paper reports on an Oracle JDeveloper plugin tool developed which applies MDA to create these four possible implementations and compares the performance of them with the help of a case study.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOCW.2008.8","publicationTitle":"2008 12th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814991/4814992/04815030.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/EDOCW.2008.8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model Driven Architecture approach to fault tolerance in Service Oriented Architectures, a performance study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Model Driven Architecture approach to fault tolerance in Service Oriented Architectures, a performance study","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4815030/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10615519","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815030/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model Driven Architecture approach to fault tolerance in Service Oriented Architectures, a performance study","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"37200293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05121S","chronDate":"16-16 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4814991","isNumber":"4814992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814991","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4814992","articleId":"4815030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815059,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279888300"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Jia Kong","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Kong","id":"37535552300"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4815059","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":123,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1384},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We consider a two-hop relay link in which orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used on both hops. Under a joint sum-power constraint, our aim is to allocate power over subcarriers on the two hops such that the instantaneous rate of the relay link is maximized. Ordered subcarrier pairing (OSP) has been proposed in the literature to further improve the relay link rate; however, the optimality of OSP has been proven only for equal power allocation and the proof of its optimality under optimal power allocation has not been available yet. In this letter, we will provide our proof which verifies that OSP is optimal for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay links when optimal power allocation is applied.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4815057/04815059.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.080864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.080864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier pairing for amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward OFDM relay links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","OFDM","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Power system modeling","Power system relaying","Frequency-selective fading channels","Wideband","Signal analysis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier pairing","amplify-and-forward relay link","decode-and-forward OFDM relay links","two-hop relay link","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","joint sum-power constraint","optimal power allocation","wireless links"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay, OFDM, power allocation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier pairing for amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward OFDM relay links","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4815059/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10587141","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier pairing for amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward OFDM relay links","sourcePdf":"0209-cl0904-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077362S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4815057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4815057","articleId":"4815059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815060,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The prediction is performed through modeling the relationship between the insulation resistance measured between distribution transformers high voltage winding, low voltage winding and the ground and the breakdown strength, interfacial tension acidity and the water content of the transformers oil. The process of predicting these oil parameters statuses is carried out using various configurations of neural networks. First, a multilayer feed forward neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm was implemented. Subsequently, a cascade of these neural networks was deemed to be more promising, and four variations of a three stage cascade were tested. The first configuration takes four inputs and outputs four parameter values, while the other configurations have four neural networks, each with two or three inputs and a single output; the output from some networks are pipelined to some others to produce the final values. Both configurations are evaluated using real-world training and testing data and the accuracy is calculated across a variety of hidden layer and hidden neuron combinations. The results indicate that even with a lack of sufficient data to train the network, accuracy levels of 84% for breakdown voltage, 95% for interfacial tension, 56% for water content, and 75% for oil acidity predictions were obtained by the cascade of neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10587134","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4815187/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A cascade of artificial neural networks to predict transformers oil parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cascade of artificial neural networks to predict transformers oil parameters","sourcePdf":"p0516-shaban.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068455S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4815151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4815151","articleId":"4815187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4815204,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Barker","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/5165570/4815204/4815204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adam Barker received the BSc degree in software engineering and the MSc degree in distributed systems from Newcastle University.

MAP is a directly executable specification, services do not have to be preconfigured at design-time. Instead, a choreography, specified in MAP, can be sent dynamically to a group of distributed peers to execute at runtime. Furthermore, MAP is based on a formal foundation, this allows model checking of the choreography definition prior to live distribution and enactment. A motivating scenario, taken from the AstroGrid science use-cases, serves as the focal point for the paper and highlights the benefits of choreography, through data flow optimization and lack of centralized server. The MAP formal syntax and model checking environment are discussed in the context of the motivating scenario, along with MagentA, an implementation of MAP which provides a concrete, and open-source framework for the enactment of distributed choreographies. MAP is evaluated by demonstrating the languages conformance to the service interaction patterns, a collection of 13 recurring workflow patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2009.8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/5165570/04815204.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2009.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choreographing Web Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815204/","displayDocTitle":"Choreographing Web Services","volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April-June 2009","accessionNumber":"10780975","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815204/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choreographing Web Services","sourcePdf":"tsc2009020152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065866S","chronDate":"April-June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"5165570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5165570","articleId":"4815204","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815208,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5226180/4815208/4815208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongbin Sun received the BS degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2003.

Although strong multibit error-correcting codes (ECC) appear to be a natural choice to handle a large number of random defects, investigation of their applications in cache remains largely missing arguably because it is commonly believed that multibit ECC may incur prohibitive performance degradation and silicon/energy cost. By developing a cost-effective L2 cache architecture using multibit ECC, this paper attempts to show that, with appropriate cache architecture design, this common belief may not necessarily hold true for L2 cache. The basic idea is to supplement a conventional L2 cache core with several special-purpose small caches/buffers, which can greatly reduce the silicon cost and minimize the probability of explicitly executing multibit ECC decoding on the cache read critical path, and meanwhile, maintain soft error tolerance. Experiments show that, at the random defect density of 0.5 percent, this design approach can maintain almost the same instruction per cycle (IPC) performance over a wide spectrum of benchmarks compared with ideal defect-free L2 cache, while only incurring less than 3 percent of silicon area overhead and 36 percent power consumption overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5226180/04815208.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Access Locality for the Efficient Use of Multibit Error-Correcting Codes in L2 Cache","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Access Locality for the Efficient Use of Multibit Error-Correcting Codes in L2 Cache","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815208/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10847100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815208/","volume":"58","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Access Locality for the Efficient Use of Multibit Error-Correcting Codes in L2 Cache","sourcePdf":"ttc2009101297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148081S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5226180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5226180","articleId":"4815208","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815213,"authors":[{"name":"Dakai Zhu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5226180/4815213/4815213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dakai Zhu received the BE degree in computer science and engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 1996, the ME degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University in 1999, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the University of Pittsburgh, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

However, it was recently shown that DVFS has direct and adverse effects on system reliability. In this work, we investigate static and dynamic reliability-aware energy management schemes to minimize energy consumption for periodic real-time systems while preserving system reliability. Focusing on earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling, we first show that the static version of the problem is NP-hard and propose two task-level utilization-based heuristics. Then, we develop a job-level online scheme by building on the idea of wrapper-tasks, to monitor and manage dynamic slack efficiently in reliability-aware settings. The feasibility of the dynamic scheme is formally proved. Finally, we present two integrated approaches to reclaim both static and dynamic slack at runtime. To preserve system reliability, the proposed schemes incorporate recovery tasks/jobs into the schedule as needed, while still using the remaining slack for energy savings. The proposed schemes are evaluated through extensive simulations. The results confirm that all the proposed schemes can preserve the system reliability, while the ordinary (but reliability-ignorant) energy management schemes result in drastically decreased system reliability. For the static heuristics, the energy savings are close to what can be achieved by an optimal solution by a margin of 5 percent. By effectively exploiting the runtime slack, the dynamic schemes can achieve additional energy savings while preserving system reliability.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.56","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5226180/04815213.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Aware Energy Management for Periodic Real-Time Tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Aware Energy Management for Periodic Real-Time Tasks","volume":"58","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815213/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847102","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815213/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Aware Energy Management for Periodic Real-Time Tasks","sourcePdf":"ttc2009101382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13843S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5226180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5226180","articleId":"4815213","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815216,"authors":[{"name":"Noha Elarief","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5165572/4815216/4815216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noha Elarief received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, and Oregon State University, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

Due to the inherent parallelism of the existing pairing algorithms, high performance can be achieved via hardware realizations. Three schemes for Tate pairing computations have been proposed in the literature: cubic elliptic, binary elliptic, and binary hyperelliptic. In this paper, we propose a new FPGA-based architecture of the Tate-pairing-based computation over binary fields. Even though our field sizes are larger than in the architectures based on cubic elliptic curves or binary hyperelliptic curves with the same security strength, nevertheless fewer multiplications in the underlying field need to be performed. As a result, the computational latency for a pairing computation has been reduced, and our implementation runs 2-20 times faster than the equivalent implementations of other pairing-based schemes at the same level of security strength. Furthermore, we ported our pairing designs for eight field sizes ranging from 239 to 557 bits to the reconfigurable computer, SGI Altix 4700 supported by Silicon Graphics, Inc., and performance and cost are demonstrated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5176044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5176044/04815221.pdf","endPage":"1237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Computing Approach for Tate Pairing Cryptosystems over Binary Fields","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.64","startPage":"1221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Computing Approach for Tate Pairing Cryptosystems over Binary Fields","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815221/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802326","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4815221/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Computing Approach for Tate Pairing Cryptosystems over Binary Fields","sourcePdf":"ttc2009091221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134595S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5176044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5176044","articleId":"4815221","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815224,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiling Lan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5372118/4815224/4815224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiling Lan received the BS degree in mathematics from Beijing Normal University, the MS degree in applied mathematics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from Northwestern University in 2002.

In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for node-level anomaly identification in large-scale systems. A set of techniques is presented to automatically analyze collected data: data transformation to construct a uniform data format for data analysis, feature extraction to reduce data size, and unsupervised learning to detect the nodes acting differently from others. Moreover, we compare two techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), for feature extraction. We evaluate our prototype implementation by injecting a variety of faults into a production system at NCSA. The results show that our mechanism, in particular, the one using ICA-based feature extraction, can effectively identify faulty nodes with high accuracy and low computation overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Automated Anomaly Identification in Large-Scale Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.52","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5372118/04815224.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5372118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward Automated Anomaly Identification in Large-Scale Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4815224/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Automated Anomaly Identification in Large-Scale Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2010020174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113424S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5372118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5372118","articleId":"4815224","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4815230,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxi Jia","affiliation":["Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Laboratory (CNDS), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5420346/4815230/4815230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingxi Jia received the BEng degree in computer science and engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

In this study, we attempt to address a generalized divisible load scheduling problem for handling loads from multiple sources on arbitrary networks. This problem is all the more challenging as 1) the topology is arbitrary, 2) in such networks, it is difficult to decide from which source and which route a processing node should receive loads, and 3) processing nodes must be allocated to different sources when they become available. We study two distinct cases of interest, static case and dynamic case, and propose two novel strategies, referred to as static scheduling strategy (SSS) and dynamic scheduling strategy (DSS), respectively. Both strategies work in an iterative fashion. In each iteration, they will use a novel graph partitioning (GP) scheme to partition the network such that each source in the network gains a portion of network resources and then these sources cooperate to process their loads. We analyze the performance of DSS using queuing theory and derive upper bounds on a load's average waiting time and a source's average queue length. We use simulation to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of SSS and DSS. Our findings reveal an interesting \u00bfload insensitive\u00bf propertyof SSS and also verify the theoretical upper bound of average queue length at each source in the dynamic case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling Multisource Divisible Loads on Arbitrary Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.62","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5420346/04815230.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Multisource Divisible Loads on Arbitrary Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4815230/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11151923","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Multisource Divisible Loads on Arbitrary Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2010040520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111541S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5420346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5420346","articleId":"4815230","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815235,"authors":[{"name":"Jag Mohan Singh","affiliation":["Center for Visual Information Technology, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5380814/4815235/4815235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jag Mohan Singh received the BTech (Honors) and MS degrees by research in computer science from the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

The important and widely applicable category of the general implicit surface has received less attention. In this paper, we present a ray-tracing procedure to render general implicit surfaces efficiently on the GPU. Though only the fourth or lower order surfaces can be rendered using analytical roots, our adaptive marching points algorithm can ray trace arbitrary implicit surfaces without multiple roots, by sampling the ray at selected points till a root is found. Adapting the sampling step size based on a proximity measure and a horizon measure delivers high speed. The sign test can handle any surface without multiple roots. The Taylor test that uses ideas from interval analysis can ray trace many surfaces with complex roots. Overall, a simple algorithm that fits the SIMD architecture of the GPU results in high performance. We demonstrate the ray tracing of algebraic surfaces up to order 50 and nonalgebraic surfaces including a Blinn's blobby with 75 spheres at better than interactive frame rates.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5380814/04815235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380814","startPage":"261","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Ray Tracing of Implicit Surfaces on the GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Ray Tracing of Implicit Surfaces on the GPU","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2010","accessionNumber":"11070545","pubMedId":"20075486","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4815235/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Ray Tracing of Implicit Surfaces on the GPU","sourcePdf":"ttg2010020261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086908S","chronDate":"March-April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5380814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5380814","articleId":"4815235","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4815247,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Han Chen","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5255979/4815247/4815247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yung-Han Chen received the PhD degree in communication engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 2007.

The fuzzy Q-learning admission control (FQAC) system is composed of a neural-fuzzy inference system (NFIS) admissibility estimator, an NFIS dwelling estimator, and a decision maker. The NFIS admissibility estimator takes essential system measures into account to judge how each reachable subnetwork can support the admission request's required QoS and then output admissibility costs. The NFIS dwelling estimator considers the Doppler shift and the power strength of the requested user to assess his/her dwell time duration in each reachable subnetwork and then output dwelling costs. Also, in order to minimize the expected maximal cost of the user's admission request, a minimax theorem is applied in the decision maker to determine the most suitable subnetwork for the user request or to reject. Simulation results show that FQAC can always maintain the system QoS requirement up to traffic intensity of 1.1 because it can appropriately admit or reject the users' admission requests. Also, the FQAC can achieve lower blocking probabilities than conventional JSAC proposed in and can significantly reduce the handoff rate by 15-20 percent.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5255979/04815247.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5255979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Q-Learning Admission Control for WCDMA/WLAN Heterogeneous Networks with Multimedia Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815247/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Q-Learning Admission Control for WCDMA/WLAN Heterogeneous Networks with Multimedia Traffic","volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879864","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815247/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Q-Learning Admission Control for WCDMA/WLAN Heterogeneous Networks with Multimedia Traffic","sourcePdf":"ttm2009111469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126232S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5255979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5255979","articleId":"4815247","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4815251,"authors":[{"name":"Qinglin Zhao","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5255979/4815251/4815251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinglin Zhao received the PhD degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2005.

Our key simplification is that the attempt rate in the nonsaturated setting can be approximated by scaling the attempt rate of the saturated setting with an appropriate factor. Use of different scaling factors leads to variants of the model for a small buffer and an infinite buffer. We develop a general fixed-point analysis that we demonstrate can have nonunique solutions for the infinite buffer model variant under moderate traffic. Nevertheless, in an asymptotic regime that applies to light traffic, we are able to prove uniqueness of the fixed point and predict the offered load at which the maximum throughput is achieved. We verify our model using ns-2 simulation and show that our MAC access delay results are the most accurate among related work, while our collision probability and throughput results achieve comparable accuracy to (D. Malone et al., 2007), (K. Duffy et al., 2007).","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5255979/04815251.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5255979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Approximate Model for Nonsaturated IEEE 802.11 DCF","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815251/","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Approximate Model for Nonsaturated IEEE 802.11 DCF","volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879869","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815251/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Approximate Model for Nonsaturated IEEE 802.11 DCF","sourcePdf":"ttm2009111539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072059S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5255979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5255979","articleId":"4815251","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815254,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Proenca","affiliation":["Departmento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhaa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Proenca","id":"37295703900"},{"name":"Silvio Filipe","affiliation":["Departmento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhaa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Filipe","id":"37865128900"},{"name":"Ricardo Santos","affiliation":["Departmento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhaa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Santos","id":"37669901400"},{"name":"Joao Oliveira","affiliation":["Departmento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhaa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"38667578300"},{"name":"Luis A.

In this paper, a joint correlation function of multiple signals is proposed to reveal and confirm that the observations after nonnegative mixing would have higher joint correlation than the original unknown sources. Accordingly, a new nonnegative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA) method is proposed to design the unmixing matrix by minimizing the joint correlation function among the estimated nonnegative sources. In addition to a closed-form solution for unmixing two mixtures of two sources, the general algorithm of nLCA for the multisource case is developed based on an iterative volume maximization (IVM) principle and linear programming. The source identifiability and required conditions are discussed and proven. The proposed nLCA algorithm, denoted by nLCA-IVM, is evaluated with both simulation data and real biomedical data to demonstrate its superior performance over several existing benchmark methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.72","startPage":"875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5432924/04815260.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.72","endPage":"888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5432924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonnegative Least-Correlated Component Analysis for Separation of Dependent Sources by Volume Maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonnegative Least-Correlated Component Analysis for Separation of Dependent Sources by Volume Maximization","volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4815260/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11180463","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","pubMedId":"20299711","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonnegative Least-Correlated Component Analysis for Separation of Dependent Sources by Volume Maximization","sourcePdf":"ttp2010050875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111092S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5432924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5432924","articleId":"4815260","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815261,"authors":[{"name":"Minwoo Park","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5209941/4815261/4815261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minwoo Park received the BEng degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, in 2004, and the MSc degree in electrical engineering from The Pennsylvania State University in 2007.

The theory of 2D crystallographic groups provides a sound and natural correspondence between the underlying lattice of a deformed wallpaper pattern and a degree-4 graphical model. We start the discovery process with unsupervised clustering of interest points and voting for consistent lattice unit proposals. The proposed lattice basis vectors and pattern element contribute to the pairwise compatibility and joint compatibility (observation model) functions in a Markov random field (MRF). Thus, we formulate the 2D lattice detection as a spatial, multitarget tracking problem, solved within an MRF framework using a novel and efficient mean-shift belief propagation (MSBP) method. Iterative detection and growth of the deformed lattice are interleaved with regularized thin-plate spline (TPS) warping, which rectifies the current deformed lattice into a regular one to ensure stability of the MRF model in the next round of lattice recovery. We provide quantitative comparisons of our proposed method with existing algorithms on a diverse set of 261 real-world photos to demonstrate significant advances in accuracy and speed over the state of the art in automatic discovery of regularity in real images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5209941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5209941/04815261.pdf","startPage":"1804","endPage":"1816","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deformed Lattice Detection in Real-World Images Using Mean-Shift Belief Propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Deformed Lattice Detection in Real-World Images Using Mean-Shift Belief Propagation","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4815261/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840328","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","pubMedId":"19696451","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deformed Lattice Detection in Real-World Images Using Mean-Shift Belief Propagation","sourcePdf":"ttp2009101804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073579S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5209941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5209941","articleId":"4815261","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4815263,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Ortega-Garcia","affiliation":["Escuela Politecnica Superior, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"],"bio":{"p":["Javier Ortega-Garcia received the PhD degree \u201ccum laude\u201d in electrical engineering in 1996 from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain.

The three scenarios include a common part of audio/video data. Also, signature and fingerprint data have been acquired both with desktop PC and mobile portable hardware. Additionally, hand and iris data were acquired in the second scenario using desktop PC. Acquisition has been conducted by 11 European institutions. Additional features of the BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) are: two acquisition sessions, several sensors in certain modalities, balanced gender and age distributions, multimodal realistic scenarios with simple and quick tasks per modality, cross-European diversity, availability of demographic data, and compatibility with other multimodal databases. The novel acquisition conditions of the BMDB allow us to perform new challenging research and evaluation of either monomodal or multimodal biometric systems, as in the recent BioSecure Multimodal Evaluation campaign. A description of this campaign including baseline results of individual modalities from the new database is also given.

We also present an EM-based algorithm to compute dense depth and occlusion maps from wide-baseline image pairs using this descriptor. This yields much better results in wide-baseline situations than the pixel and correlation-based algorithms that are commonly used in narrow-baseline stereo. Also, using a descriptor makes our algorithm robust against many photometric and geometric transformations. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF, which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance when used densely. It is important to note that our approach is the first algorithm that attempts to estimate dense depth maps from wide-baseline image pairs, and we show that it is a good one at that with many experiments for depth estimation accuracy, occlusion detection, and comparing it against other descriptors on laser-scanned ground truth scenes. We also tested our approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes with different photometric and geometric transformations and our experiments support our claim to being robust against these.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.77","startPage":"815","endPage":"830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5432924/04815264.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5432924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAISY: An Efficient Dense Descriptor Applied to Wide-Baseline Stereo","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"DAISY: An Efficient Dense Descriptor Applied to Wide-Baseline Stereo","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11180464","pubMedId":"20299707","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4815264/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAISY: An Efficient Dense Descriptor Applied to Wide-Baseline Stereo","sourcePdf":"ttp2010050815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079695S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5432924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"844","xplore-issue":"5432924","articleId":"4815264","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815270,"authors":[{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5209941/4815270/4815270-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abhinav Gupta received the MS degree in computer science from the University of Maryland in 2007 and the BTech degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2004.

It involves understanding scene or event, analyzing human movements, recognizing manipulable objects, and observing the effect of the human movement on those objects. While each of these perceptual tasks can be conducted independently, recognition rate improves when interactions between them are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which integrates various perceptual tasks involved in understanding human-object interactions. Previous approaches to object and action recognition rely on static shape or appearance feature matching and motion analysis, respectively. Our approach goes beyond these traditional approaches and applies spatial and functional constraints on each of the perceptual elements for coherent semantic interpretation. Such constraints allow us to recognize objects and actions when the appearances are not discriminative enough. We also demonstrate the use of such constraints in recognition of actions from static images without using any motion information.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5209941/04815270.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5209941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observing Human-Object Interactions: Using Spatial and Functional Compatibility for Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Image recognition","Object recognition","Pattern recognition","Videos","Bayesian methods","Shape","Motion analysis","Information analysis","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","behavioural sciences","human factors","image recognition","motion estimation","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-object interactions","spatial compatibility","functional compatibility","psychological studies","human perception","Bayesian approach","objects recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action recognition","object recognition","functional recognition."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Human Activities","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Biological","Movement","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Recognition (Psychology)","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Observing Human-Object Interactions: Using Spatial and Functional Compatibility for Recognition","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4815270/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840330","pubMedId":"19696449","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observing Human-Object Interactions: Using Spatial and Functional Compatibility for Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2009101775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17124S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5209941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"5209941","articleId":"4815270","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4815299,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Khodayari","affiliation":["INSA-Lyon, LGEF Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Electrique et Ferro\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"p":["Akram Khodayari received the bachelor's and master's of science degrees in mechanical engineering from Razi (Kermanshah, Iran, 1997) and Bou-Ali Sina Universities (Hamadan, Iran, 2004), respectively.

The purpose is to minimize the observation window needed to estimate the spectrogram to provide a better temporal resolution and gain more flexibility when designing the data acquisition sequence. The methods can also provide better quality of the estimated power spectral density (PSD) of the blood signal. Adaptive spectral estimation techniques are known to provide good spectral resolution and contrast even when the observation window is very short. The 2 adaptive techniques are tested and compared with the averaged periodogram (Welch's method). The blood power spectral capon (BPC) method is based on a standard minimum variance technique adapted to account for both averaging over slow-time and depth. The blood amplitude and phase estimation technique (BAPES) is based on finding a set of matched filters (one for each velocity component of interest) and filtering the blood process over slow-time and averaging over depth to find the PSD. The methods are tested using various experiments and simulations. First, controlled flow-rig experiments with steady laminar flow are carried out. Simulations in Field II for pulsating flow resembling the femoral artery are also analyzed. The simulations are followed by in vivo measurement on the common carotid artery. In all simulations and experiments it was concluded that the adaptive methods display superior performance for short observation windows compared with the averaged periodogram. Computational costs and implementation details are also discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815291","startPage":"700","endPage":"714","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4815291/04815300.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive spectral doppler estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4815300/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive spectral doppler estimation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10587883","pubMedId":"19406699","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive spectral doppler estimation","sourcePdf":"t0940700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085116S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4815291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4815291","articleId":"4815300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4815311,"authors":[{"name":"Sanna Harma","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4815291/4815311/4815311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanna H\u00e4rm\u00e4 was born in Kotka, Finland, in 1977.

Test suite reduction based on coverage information has been discussed in many previous works. However, the applications of such techniques on real test suites and realistic measurements of redundancy have not yet been experimented thoroughly. To address such a need, we formulate in this paper two experimental metrics for coverage-based measurement of test redundancy in the context of JUnit test suites. We then evaluate the approach by measuring the redundancy of four real Java projects. The automated measures are compared with manual redundancy decisions (performed through an inspection by a tester). The results and lessons learned are interesting and somewhat surprising in that besides they show usefulness of coverage information, they present a set of shortcomings (in terms of precision) for the simplistic coverage-based redundancy measurement approach as discussed in the literature. The root-cause analysis of our observations identify several key lessons learned which should help the testing researchers and practitioners in devising better techniques for more precise measurement of test redundancy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Software testing","Fault detection","System testing","Electric variables measurement","Software measurement","Software quality","Costs","Java","Inspection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Java","minimisation","program testing","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test redundancy measurement","coverage information","test minimization","test suite reduction","JUnit test suites","Java projects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Test Maintenance","Test Redundancy","Test Coverage","JUnit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICST.2009.8","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Software Testing Verification and Validation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Software Testing Verification and Validation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815321/4815322/04815354.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2009.8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Redundancy Measurement Based on Coverage Information: Evaluations and Lessons Learned","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test Redundancy Measurement Based on Coverage Information: Evaluations and Lessons Learned","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815354/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815354/","accessionNumber":"10574492","conferenceDate":"1-4 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Redundancy Measurement Based on Coverage Information: Evaluations and Lessons Learned","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"3601a220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082789S","chronDate":"1-4 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815321","isNumber":"4815322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815321","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4815322","articleId":"4815354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4815385,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

Specifically, we focus on JPEG2000 as a case study. This paper indicates that by utilizing the in-built error resiliency of multimedia content, and the disjoint nature of the encoding and decoding processes, ultra low power architectures that are hardware fault tolerant can be conceived. These architectures utilize aggressive voltage scaling to conserve power at the encoder side while incurring extra processing requirements at the decoder to blindly detect and correct for encoder hardware induced errors. Simulations indicate a reduction of up to 35% in encoder power depending on the choice of technology for a 65-nm CMOS process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815385/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664177","volume":"17","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low Power JPEG2000 Encoder With Iterative and Fault Tolerant Error Concealment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Power JPEG2000 Encoder With Iterative and Fault Tolerant Error Concealment","sourcePdf":"17tvlsi05-mmakhzan-2016714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080644S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4957542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4957542","articleId":"4815385","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4815386,"authors":[{"name":"Rajarajan Senguttuvan","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4957542/4815386/4815386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajarajan Senguttuvan (S'02) received the B.E.

During EVM test, a modulated RF input signal is down-converted and demodulated to obtain the output baseband digital data and EVM is computed by processing the baseband digital data. Hence, production testing of OFDM devices would require such modulation- and demodulation-capable automated test equipment (ATE) to perform EVM test. Such capabilities significantly add up to the cost of the ATE, thereby increasing the overall cost of testing. Moreover, test time for EVM can be relatively long compared to other tests due to the need to average over a large number of data bits. In this paper, we propose a methodology for testing EVM using multi-tone signals sourced from inexpensive signal sources that generate standard constellations. Moreover, introducing null carriers in the multi-tone test stimulus enables accurate characterization of system noise with reduced number of data bits. This enables significant speedup in EVM testing. We present the theory to corroborate the proposed approach along with simulation and hardware results. The proposed test method also has the potential to significantly reduce EVM test time under production test conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Null Carriers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2006074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4957542/04815386.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2006074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Null Carriers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4815386/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664179","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Null Carriers","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi12-rsenguttuvan-2006074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057028S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4957542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4957542","articleId":"4815386","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815392,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Fu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education and the Research Center of Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Fu","id":"37286601500"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education and the Research Center of Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Tianyou","lastName":"Chai","id":"37268730400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4815392","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":896},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Open loop systems","Neural networks","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Intelligent networks","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","discrete time systems","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","open loop systems","stability","time-varying systems","wind tunnels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent decoupling control","nonlinear multivariable discrete-time systems","injector-driven transonic wind tunnel system","open-loop approximately dynamical decoupling control","neural networks","fixed decoupling controllers","adaptive decoupling controller","bounded-input-bounded-output stability","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximately dynamical decoupling control","intelligent control","multiple models","neural networks (NNs)","stability","2.4 $\\times$ 2.4-m wind tunnel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815392","abstract":"In this paper, for a class of nonlinear multivariable discrete-time systems, an open-loop approximately dynamical decoupling control law is first presented.

A robust adaptive controller is proposed with the utilization of adaptive control, backstepping and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed control scheme employs the adaptive control approach to design an auxiliary wheel velocity controller to make the tracking error as small as possible in consideration of uncertainties in the kinematics of the robot, and makes use of the fuzzy logic systems to learn the behaviors of the unknown dynamics of the robot and the wheel actuators. The approximation errors and external disturbances can be efficiently counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. A major advantage of the proposed method is that previous knowledge of the robot kinematics and the dynamics of the robot and wheel actuators is no longer necessary. This is because the controller learns both the robot kinematics and the robot and wheel actuator dynamics online. Most importantly, all signals in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. For the dynamic uncertainties of robot and actuator, the assumption of ldquolinearity in the unknown parametersrdquo and tedious analysis of determining the ldquoregression matricesrdquo in the standard adaptive robust controllers are no longer necessary. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation example.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5109813/04815397.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2012516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2012516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Control of an Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robot via Backstepping and Fuzzy Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Mobile robots","Backstepping","Fuzzy control","Wheels","Actuators","Uncertainty","Robot kinematics","Robust control","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","fuzzy control","mobile robots","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","robust control","tracking","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrically driven nonholonomic mobile robot","backstepping","fuzzy logic","tracking control","model uncertainty","robot kinematics","robot dynamics","wheel actuator dynamics","robust adaptive control","auxiliary wheel velocity control","tracking error","approximation error","external disturbance","robust compensator","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuator dynamics","adaptive","backstepping control","fuzzy logic","nonholonomic mobile robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of an Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robot via Backstepping and Fuzzy Approach","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4815397/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10721225","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of an Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robot via Backstepping and Fuzzy Approach","sourcePdf":"tcst-hou-2012516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090511S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5109813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5109813","articleId":"4815397","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4815407,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Aidin Bassam","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4909498/4815407/4815407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seyed Aidin Bassam (S'06) received the B.Sc. degree from the Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree (with honors) from K.

Crosstalk can take place before or after the power amplifiers, designated herein as nonlinear and linear crosstalk, respectively. This paper demonstrates that, contrary to linear crosstalk, nonlinear crosstalk significantly affects the performance of the digital predistortion algorithm; and, it cannot be embedded and compensated for by the conventional channel matrix inversion algorithm at the receiver side of MIMO links. Based on a parametric study of system-level simulations and measurements, it was found that for a -20-dB nonlinear crosstalk level, the use of a memory multibranch polynomial predistorter, along with the channel matrix inversion algorithm, bounds the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) for a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) signal to -46 dBc and the error vector magnitude (EVM) for a world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) signal to -43 dB in MIMO links. The proposed CO-DPD was investigated and analyzed for the MIMO transmitter with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n = 2, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the number of RF front-ends.

The same improvement was observed in the EVM measurement of the WiMAX signal, where the EVM decreases from -21.22 dB for the conventional DPD to -49.71 dB for the proposed CO-DPD.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4909498/04815407.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2017258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crossover Digital Predistorter for the Compensation of Crosstalk and Nonlinearity in MIMO Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Crossover Digital Predistorter for the Compensation of Crosstalk and Nonlinearity in MIMO Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815407/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10628408","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815407/","volume":"57","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crossover Digital Predistorter for the Compensation of Crosstalk and Nonlinearity in MIMO Transmitters","sourcePdf":"57tmtt05-sbassam-part1-2017258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120795S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4909498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4909498","articleId":"4815407","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815408,"authors":[{"name":"Subhadeep Roy","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4918974/4815408/4815408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Subhadeep Roy received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Maharaja SayajiRao University, Baroda, India, in 2000 and the M.

This causes significant signal distortion in phase coherent transmissions by introducing intersymbol interference (ISI), which can span several hundreds of symbols. The multipath structure is usually very sparse. This paper proposes an adaptive sparse partial response equalizer (SPRE) well matched with the channel characteristics to mitigate the ISI efficiently, and communicate reliably. Unlike the conventional equalizers that try to eliminate the ISI completely, the proposed structure performs equalization in two steps. In the first step, the channel is equalized to a judiciously chosen target impulse response (TIR), thereby leaving controlled residual ISI at the output of the SPRE. In the second step, the residual ISI is further mitigated by a near-optimal, graph-based, low-complexity symbol detection algorithm known as belief propagation (BP). We demonstrate that due to the sparse nature of the long ISI channel, and the well-matched adaptive TIR, this two-step equalization process is particularly useful. The idea here can be compared to what is done in the magnetic recording literature [i.e., partial response maximum-likelihood (ML) equalization] to avoid excessive noise enhancement, with the difference that the TIR needs to be designed adaptively using training symbols and that in the second step, instead of using a ML detector, a BP algorithm is used. The proposed SPRE algorithm is designed for a general multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system and it provides soft outputs for the transmitted bits as a by-product of the BP-type equalization algorithm. Hence, it can be efficiently employed in coded systems (e.g., turbo or low-density-parity-check-coded, interleaved systems) with an iterative decoding/equalization scheme, providing significant improvements in achievable error rates. Finally, we note that the proposed SPRE scheme also incorporates a phase locked loop (PLL) structure so as to track the Doppler shift introduced by the channel. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed equalizer, we compare it with several decision feedback equalizers (DFEs) proposed by Stojanovic (J. Ocean. Eng. vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 100-111, Jan. 1994), Roy (Proc. MTS/IEEE TECHNO-OCEAN Conf., vol. 1, pp. 26-33, Nov. 2004), and Roy (J. Ocean. Eng., vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 663-688, Jul. 2004) both through simulations and experimental results. The results demonstrate that the SPRE receiver outperforms the decision-feedback-based receivers when the channel has long, yet sparse (possibly, nonminimum phase) structure, by reducing the frame error rates (FERs), improving the post-equalization signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and decreasing the required number of turbo iterations (reduced latency).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","MIMO","Underwater communication","Intersymbol interference","Iterative algorithms","Delay","Adaptive equalizers","Algorithm design and analysis","Phase locked loops","Oceans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","MIMO communication","multipath channels","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic channels","shallow-water","time-varying multipath structure","significant signal distortion","phase coherent transmissions","intersymbol interference","adaptive sparse partial response equalizer","SPRE","target impulse response","symbol detection algorithm","belief propagation","well-matched adaptive TIR","two-step equalization process","magnetic recording","noise enhancement","multiple-input-multiple-output system","MIMO","BP-type equalization algorithm","iterative decoding/equalization scheme","phase locked loop structure","Doppler shift","decision feedback equalizers","decision-feedback-based receivers","frame error rates","signal-to-noise ratio","turbo iterations","underwater communications","Pacific Ocean"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation (BP) detection","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","partial response equalization","sparse equalization","turbo equalization (TE)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JOE.2009.2014658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4918974/04815408.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4918974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2009.2014658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Rate Improvement in Underwater MIMO Communications Using Sparse Partial Response Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Rate Improvement in Underwater MIMO Communications Using Sparse Partial Response Equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815408/","volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815408/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10660903","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Rate Improvement in Underwater MIMO Communications Using Sparse Partial Response Equalization","sourcePdf":"joe-sroy-2014658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083864S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4918974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4918974","articleId":"4815408","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4815413,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kuei Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/4939467/4815413/4815413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Kuei Hsieh received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2001.

When discretized at subatomic distances, the volume is inherently sparse. Noiseless measurements from an imaging technology can be modeled by convolution of the image with the system point spread function (psf). Such is the case with magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), an emerging technology where imaging of an individual tobacco mosaic virus was recently demonstrated with nanometer resolution. We also consider additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in the measurements. Many prior works of sparse estimators have focused on the case when \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</b>\n has low coherence; however, the system matrix \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</b>\n in our application is the convolution matrix for the system psf. A typical convolution matrix has high coherence. This paper, therefore, does not assume a low coherence \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</b>\n. A discrete-continuous form of the Laplacian and atom at zero (LAZE) p.d.f. used by Johnstone and Silverman is formulated, and two sparse estimators derived by maximizing the joint p.d.f. of the observation and image conditioned on the hyperparameters. A thresholding rule that generalizes the hard and soft thresholding rule appears in the course of the derivation. This so-called hybrid thresholding rule, when used in the iterative thresholding framework, gives rise to the hybrid estimator, a generalization of the lasso. Estimates of the hyperparameters for the lasso and hybrid estimator are obtained via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). A numerical study with a Gaussian psf and two sparse images shows that the hybrid estimator outperforms the lasso.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2017156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4919437/04815420.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1227","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2017156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Image Reconstruction for Molecular Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Image Reconstruction for Molecular Imaging","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4815420/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10647818","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","pubMedId":"19380271","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Image Reconstruction for Molecular Imaging","sourcePdf":"18tip06-mting-2017156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096596S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4919437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4919437","articleId":"4815420","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4815422,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4919437/4815422/4815422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang Ma (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2005.

First, we show that the noncausal model can be solved by splitting it into multiple causal HMMs and simultaneously solving each causal HMM using a fully synchronous distributed computing framework, therefore referred to as distributed HMMs. Next we present an approximate solution to the multiple causal HMMs that is based on an alternating updating scheme and assumes a realistic sequential computing framework. The parameters of the distributed causal HMMs are estimated by extending the classical 1-D training and classification algorithms to multiple dimensions. The proposed extension to arbitrary causal, multidimensional HMMs allows state transitions that are dependent on all causal neighbors. We, thus, extend three fundamental algorithms to multidimensional causal systems, i.e., 1) expectation-maximization (EM), 2) general forward-backward (GFB), and 3) Viterbi algorithms. In the simulations, we choose to limit ourselves to a noncausal 2-D model whose noncausality is along a single dimension, in order to significantly reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance, higher accuracy rate, and applicability of the proposed noncausal HMM framework to image and video classification.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4919437/04815422.pdf","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2017166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2017166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Event Classification and Image Segmentation Based on Noncausal Multidimensional Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Multidimensional systems","Hidden Markov models","Image classification","Computational modeling","Motion analysis","Speech recognition","Distributed computing","Classification algorithms","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","image classification","image segmentation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation","multidimensional signal processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video event classification","image segmentation","multidimensional hidden Markov model","synchronous distributed computing","1-D training","expectation-maximization algorithm","general forward-backward","Viterbi algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov model (HMM)","image classification","image segmentation","motion trajectory analysis","video classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Video Event Classification and Image Segmentation Based on Noncausal Multidimensional Hidden Markov Models","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4815422/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10647817","pubMedId":"19380269","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Event Classification and Image Segmentation Based on Noncausal Multidimensional Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"18tip06-xma-2017166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086206S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4919437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4919437","articleId":"4815422","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815425,"authors":[{"name":"Keehoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5337733/4815425/4815425-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keehoon Kim (S'05\u2013A'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 1999, 2001, and 2006, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.

We emphasize the tradeoffs between key design factors, including force capability, workspace, size, bandwidth, weight, and mechanism complexity. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815425/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10977556","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4815425/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Miniature Haptic Devices for Upper Extremity Prosthetics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Miniature Haptic Devices for Upper Extremity Prosthetics","sourcePdf":"tmech-kim-2013944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089711S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5337733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5337733","articleId":"4815425","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4815437,"authors":[{"name":"Yukie Nagai","affiliation":["Research Institute for Cognition and Robotics, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563672/5038478/4815437/4815437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yukie Nagai received the Master degree in engineering from Aoyama Gakuin University, Japan in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Osaka University, Japan, in 2004.","From 2002 to 2004, she was a Research Associate at the Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University.

Since infants' knowledge about the context is limited, which is comparable to robots, parents are supposed to properly guide their attention by emphasizing the important aspects of the action. Our analysis employing a bottom-up attention model revealed that motionese has the effects of highlighting the initial and final states of the action, indicating significant state changes in it, and underlining the properties of objects used in the action. Suppression and addition of parents' body movement and their frequent social signals to infants produced these effects. Our findings are discussed toward designing robots that can take advantage of parental teaching.","doi":"10.1109/TAMD.2009.2021090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563672/5038478/04815437.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2009.2021090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5038478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Analysis of Motionese Toward Scaffolding Robot Action Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815437/","displayDocTitle":"Computational Analysis of Motionese Toward Scaffolding Robot Action Learning","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10712645","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815437/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Analysis of Motionese Toward Scaffolding Robot Action Learning","sourcePdf":"01tamd01-ynagai-2021090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06444S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5038478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5038478","articleId":"4815437","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4815449,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Serena","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5133707/4815449/4815449-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Serena was born in Piacenza, Italy, in 1973.

The idea is based on optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) scheme in GMPLS network using multilength variable-weight optical orthogonal codes(MLVW-OOC) as signature sequences. The router architecture of the proposed multiservice GMPLS network is also presented. To provide a requested service, the length and the weight of codes are designed based on the service characteristics. Furthermore, to guarantee the desired service, we propose to limit the number of connections based on the activity coefficient of the connected paths. In order to analyze the network performance, the end-to-end bit error rate (e - e BER) of a connection and the probability of QoS degradation (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deg</sub>\n) are considered as benchmarks. To obtain the e - e BER of the connected path, a closed-form relation describing the BER of the MLVW-OOC-based OCDM system is derived, and the Erlang's model is used to examine the P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deg</sub>\n. As a case study, a four-class network is designed with the proposed labeling scheme and the performance of each class is investigated. The numerical results reveal that users with high-weight codeword acquire better performance. Furthermore, by increasing the number of intermediate routers, the e - e BER is increased and the performance can be improved by limiting the number of connected paths.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5067409/04815455.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2012","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2006194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2006194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067409","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Multiservice Path Switching in Optical Code Switched GMPLS Core Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical transmitters","Code division multiplexing","Multiprotocol label switching","Protocols","Wavelength division multiplexing","Labeling","Bit error rate","Degradation","Optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","error statistics","multiprotocol label switching","optical fibre networks","orthogonal codes","probability","quality of service","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical multiservice path switching","optical code switched GMPLS core network","generalized multiprotocol label switching","optical code division multiplexing","multilength variable-weight optical orthogonal code","signature sequence","router architecture","end-to-end bit error rate","QoS degradation probability","Erlang model","four-class network design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS)","multiservice path switching","optical code division multiplexing (OCDM)","optical code switched","QoS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Multiservice Path Switching in Optical Code Switched GMPLS Core Networks","volume":"27","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4815455/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10757637","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Multiservice Path Switching in Optical Code Switched GMPLS Core Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-salehi-2006194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075126S","chronDate":"June15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5067409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5067409","articleId":"4815455","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815456,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The dependence of the optimum carrier suppression ratio is identified on DML operating condition and optical input power. It is shown that, for DML-based optical amplification-free metropolitan systems, 30 Gb/s over 80-km SMF transmission is achievable, which doubles the performance obtained by using double-sideband (DSB) OOFDM signals without carrier suppression, and that 10 Gb/s over 1200-km SMF transmission is also feasible for DML-based long-haul systems consisting of optical amplifiers. The results indicate that the SSB technique with an optimum carrier suppression ratio reduces considerably the DML-induced nonlinear effect, and leads to decreased susceptibility of the aforementioned transmission performance to variations in DML operating condition and optical input power.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5133707/04815456.pdf","startPage":"2412","endPage":"2419","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2010718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2010718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5133707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Directly Modulated DFB Lasers on the Transmission Performance of Carrier-Suppressed Single-Sideband Optical OFDM Signals Over IMDD SMF Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Optical modulation","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Fiber lasers","Amplitude modulation","Intensity modulation","System performance","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","intensity modulation","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directly modulated DFB lasers","transmission performance","carrier-suppressed single-sideband optical OFDM signal","IMDD SMF system","single-mode fiber","intensity-modulation and direct-detection","optical amplification-free metropolitan system","DML-based long-haul system","optical amplifier","bit rate 30 Gbit/s","distance 80 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system performance","optical fiber communication","optical modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Directly Modulated DFB Lasers on the Transmission Performance of Carrier-Suppressed Single-Sideband Optical OFDM Signals Over IMDD SMF Systems","volume":"27","issue":"13","htmlLink":"/document/4815456/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10772719","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Directly Modulated DFB Lasers on the Transmission Performance of Carrier-Suppressed Single-Sideband Optical OFDM Signals Over IMDD SMF Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-tang-2010718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087361S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4815456","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815466,"authors":[{"name":"Bih-Chyun Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5133707/4815466/4815466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bih-Chyun Yeh was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1973.

The PC effects were studied by changing the lattice constants from 300 to 500 nm. The results obtained indicate that the waveguide-excited plasmon absorption peak of periodic array of gold nanoparticles is tunable from 672 to 707 nm due to the second grating order propagating backward at the grazing angle. The nanoparticle-induced extinction of the waveguide mode was also investigated by varying the slab thickness from 100 to 375 nm. The results show that the extinction peak shifts from 650 to 705 nm. The theoretical results predict that the interactions of the periodic array of gold nanoparticles are strongly affected by the dispersion of the waveguide.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2006577","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5133707/04815472.pdf","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2006577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5133707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D FDTD Analysis of Gold-Nanoparticle-Based Photonic Crystal on Slab Waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815472/","displayDocTitle":"3-D FDTD Analysis of Gold-Nanoparticle-Based Photonic Crystal on Slab Waveguide","volume":"27","issue":"13","publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10733060","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815472/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D FDTD Analysis of Gold-Nanoparticle-Based Photonic Crystal on Slab Waveguide","sourcePdf":"jlt-sabarinathan-2006577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065494S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4815472","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815476,"authors":[{"name":"Prasanna A.

The bandpass sampling technique is used to digitize the RF signal. An analytical model, which is transparent to any modulation format, was developed to assess the transmission performance of a digitized RF signal in M-level quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) format. Using this analytical model, key design parameters such as bit resolution, link bit rate, receiver sensitivity, and link signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were analyzed for a digitized 2.475 GHz RF signal with 16-QAM data modulation format and 6 MSymbols/s baud rate over a 20-km optical link. The analytical results show that the link SNR is predominantly determined by the performance of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). We experimentally demonstrated the digitized RF transmission over a 20-km optical link. The analytical model and experimental results show that the performance of the link SNR is governed by jitter noise beyond 7 bits of resolution of the ADC. Using an ADC with 8-bit resolution, a 2.475 GHz RF signal with 16-QAM 6 MSymbols/s data was successfully transmitted and recovered with very good error vector magnitude of 1.77.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June15, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10757642","htmlLink":"/document/4815476/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Digitized RF-Over-Fiber Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Digitized RF-Over-Fiber Links","sourcePdf":"jlt-angulugahagamage-2006689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082978S","chronDate":"June15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5067409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5067409","articleId":"4815476","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4815479,"authors":[{"name":"Andrzej Kazmierczak","affiliation":["Applied Photonics Department, Multitel a.s.b.l., Mons, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4815479/4815479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrzej Ka\u017amierczak graduated (hons) from the Technical University, Lod\u017a, Lod\u017a (Poland), in 2003.

We consider quantization noise and compute the minimum number of bits required in the digital-to-analog converter (D/A).

In this paper, we present a network-based model of power consumption in optical IP networks and use this model to estimate the energy consumption of the Internet. The model includes the core, metro and edge, access and video distribution networks, and takes into account energy consumption in switching and transmission equipment. We include a number of access technologies, including digital subscriber line with ADSL2+, fiber to the home using passive optical networks, fiber to the node combined with very high-speed digital subscriber line and point-to-point optical systems. In addition to estimating the power consumption of today's Internet, we make predictions of power consumption in a future higher capacity Internet using estimates of improvements in efficiency in coming generations of network equipment. We estimate that the Internet currently consumes about 0.4% of electricity consumption in broadband-enabled countries. While the energy efficiency of network equipment will improve, and savings can be made by employing optical bypass and multicast, the power consumption of the Internet could approach 1% of electricity consumption as access rates increase. The energy consumption per bit of data on the Internet is around 75\\bm muJ at low access rates and decreases to around 2-4 \\bm muJ at an access rate of 100 Mb/s.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Consumption in Optical IP Networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2010142","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5133707/04815495.pdf","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2010142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5133707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy Consumption in Optical IP Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"13","htmlLink":"/document/4815495/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10733063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Consumption in Optical IP Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-baliga-2010142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077195S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"348","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4815495","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815498,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Numerical simulations are used to determine the optimal fiber length and seeding configuration for dual-wavelength amplification in the fiber. Each signal is amplified to an average power of 0.5 W with pulse durations of around 5 ps. Performance issues associated with two-signal amplification in Yb-doped fibers are discussed, as well as perspectives for increasing the wavelength separation of the seed lasers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diode lasers","Pulse amplifiers","Optical fiber polarization","Optical fiber amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Oscillators","Fiber lasers","Laser mode locking","Semiconductor lasers","Optical pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser mode locking","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-pulse dual-wavelength source","mode locking","diode lasers","single double-clad fiber amplifier","external-cavity semiconductor oscillators","polarization","dual-wavelength amplification","two-signal amplification","pulse durations","seeding configuration","frequency 577 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mode-locked lasers","optical fiber amplifiers","optical pulse amplifiers","semiconductor lasers","ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers (YDFAs)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2009950","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/04815498.pdf","startPage":"3416","endPage":"3424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2009950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Pulse Dual-Wavelength System Based on Mode-Locked Diode Lasers With a Single Polarization-Maintaining Yb:Fiber Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Short-Pulse Dual-Wavelength System Based on Mode-Locked Diode Lasers With a Single Polarization-Maintaining Yb:Fiber Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815498/","volume":"27","issue":"16","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815498/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10800543","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Pulse Dual-Wavelength System Based on Mode-Locked Diode Lasers With a Single Polarization-Maintaining Yb:Fiber Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jlt-budz-2009950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054693S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"4815498","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815502,"authors":[{"name":"Michael L.

A wide zone can be created over which power transfer is relatively constant. This gives good tolerance to the alignment of the pickup relative to the track allowing simple low-cost pickup structures to be used. While three-phase IPT tracks make the vehicle pickup and power transfer simpler, they are difficult for the power supply to drive due to the presence of mutual coupling between the track phases resulting from the physical layout of the track. These mutual inductances induce voltages within each track phase that, because of the inductor-capacitor-inductor network, cause large currents within the power supply inverter and imbalances within the system. This paper presents an analytical assessment of the problems caused by the interphase mutual inductance, and three possible solutions. Two of the methods involve modifications to the track layout to alter or remove the mutual inductances, while the third and preferred technique requires additional ferrite cores between the various phases to compensate this adverse mutual inductance without affecting the power transfer to the pickup loads.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2020076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04815502.pdf","startPage":"2393","endPage":"2400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2020076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interphase Mutual Inductance in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Interphase Mutual Inductance in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815502/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10736244","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815502/","volume":"56","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interphase Mutual Inductance in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-kissin-2020076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088265S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4815502","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815503,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Fuel Cell Center, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4815503/4815503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong-Jong Wai (M'99\u2013A'00\u2013M'02\u2013SM'05) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1974.

Sometimes, with sparse data, individual parameters cannot be satisfactorily obtained. In such cases, a population approach could be preferable. These methods allow borrowing information across all subjects simultaneously, quantifying population features directly, and subsequently, deriving individual parameter estimates. In this paper, we assessed different estimation methods on simulated datasets. Besides the standard WLS approach, we applied iterative procedures (iterative two-stage (ITS) and global two-stage (GTS) methods) as well as nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMEMs), where the likelihood is based on model linearization: first-order (FO), FO conditional estimation (FOCE), and Laplace (LAP) approximations. The synthetic dataset, initially very rich, was progressively reduced (by 50% and 75%) in order to assess the robustness of the results in sparsely sampled situations. Our results show that, even with intensive sampling, population approaches provide more reliable parameter estimates. Moreover, these estimates are remarkably more robust when the data become scarce. ITS and GTS encounter critical problems when single subjects have very poor sampling schedules, whereas the NLMEM (excluding FO) methods are more versatile and able to cope with such situations. FOCE appears as the most satisfactory approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sugar","Parameter estimation","Sampling methods","Testing","Least squares approximation","Statistical

Popular wireless link-layer protocols, such as retransmission (ARQ) based 802.11 and hybrid ARQ methods provide some level of reliability while largely ignoring the latency issue which is critical for real-time applications. Therefore, they suffer from low throughput (under high-error rates) and large waiting-times leading to serious degradation of video playback quality. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for video communication which captures the behavior of real-time video traffic at the wireless link-layer while taking into consideration both reliability and latency conditions. Using this framework, we introduce a delay constraint packet embedded error control (DC-PEEC) protocol for wireless link-layer. DC-PEEC ensures reliable and rapid delivery of video packets by employing various channel codes to minimize fluctuations in throughput and provide timely arrival of video. In addition to theoretically analyzing DC-PEEC, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed by simulating real-time video communication over ldquorealrdquo channel traces collected on 802.11 b WLANs using H.264/AVC JM14.0 video codec. The experimental results demonstrate performance gains of 5-10 dB for different real-time video scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2017622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4939467/04815530.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2017622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Constraint Error Control Protocol for Real-Time Video Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Delay Constraint Error Control Protocol for Real-Time Video Communication","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4815530/","accessionNumber":"10664190","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Constraint Error Control Protocol for Real-Time Video Communication","sourcePdf":"11tmm04-ssoltani-2017622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060617S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4939467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4939467","articleId":"4815530","onlineDate":"17 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4815531,"authors":[{"name":"Arno H.

Which method is the best in practice? This depends much on the purpose of solving : what error rate can be tolerated, what is the ultimate measure of performance (e.g., frame-error-rate, worst-case complexity, or average complexity), and what computational platform is used. Additionally, the bits in s may be part of a larger code word and different s vectors in that code word may either see the same H (slow fading) or many different realizations of H (fast fading). This complicates the picture, because notions that are important in slow fading (such as spatial diversity) are less important in fast fading, where diversity is provided anyway by time variations. Detection for MIMO has been an active field for more than ten years, and this research will probably continue for some time.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2009.932126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4815532/04815548.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.932126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Detection Methods: How They Work [Lecture Notes]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Detection Methods: How They Work [Lecture Notes]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815548/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10574829","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815548/","volume":"26","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Detection Methods: How They Work [Lecture Notes]","sourcePdf":"16-26msp03-lecturenotes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040159S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4815532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4815532","articleId":"4815548","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4815561,"authors":[{"name":"Junle Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, VLSI Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Junle","lastName":"Pan","id":"38188778400"},{"name":"Libin Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, VLSI Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Libin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37272980500"},{"name":"Yong Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, VLSI Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Lian","id":"37085343628"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2598-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2599-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4815561","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":586},"abstract":"This paper presents a single chip class D audio power amplifier realized in a 0.35 mum CMOS technology. This chip consists of a high-linear single-loop feed-forward Sigma-Delta modulator with three level quantizer and a full H-bridge output stage. The three-level quantizer effectively reduces the switching activity of the output stage, especially when the input signal amplitude is low, hence improves the power efficiency. Direct feedback from H-bridge output improves the linearity of the amplifier. With a 3.3-V supply voltage and 4-Ohm load, the amplifier can deliver maximum 1-W output power with THD less than 0.8% at 8 kHz and reaches a maximum power efficiency more than 80%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Delta-sigma modulation","Power amplifiers","Pulse width modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Feedforward systems","Quantization","Topology","High power amplifiers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","feedback","power amplifiers","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sigma-Delta class D audio power amplifier","CMOS technology","high-linear single-loop feed-forward Sigma-Delta modulator","three level quantizer","full H-bridge output stage","direct feedback","voltage 3.3 V","power 1 W","frequency 8 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["\u0394\u03a3 modulation","feedforward","1.5bit quantization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815561","publicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808358/4815559/04815561.pdf","startPage":"I-5","endPage":"I-8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sigma-Delta class D audio power amplifier in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sigma-Delta class D audio power amplifier in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815561/","isConference":true,"volume":"01","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815561/","accessionNumber":"10574140","conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sigma-Delta class D audio power amplifier in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS technology","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141924S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808358","isNumber":"4815559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4815559","articleId":"4815561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4815583,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif A.

The techniques that provide the highest data stability, the lowest leakage power consumption, and the smallest memory cell area are identified. The first circuit technique employs a dynamic voltage swing wordline driver to control the operation of the standard six-transistor (6 T) memory cells. The wordline voltage swing is dynamically tuned during read and write operations in order to simultaneously enhance the read stability and the write margin without increasing the size of the transistors in the SRAM cell. The other three circuit techniques tackle the data stability challenge by modifying the memory cell circuit structure. A nine-transistor (9 T), an eighttransistor (8 T), and a dual-threshold-voltage (dual-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n) seven-transistor (7 T) SRAM circuit are considered in this paper. The data storage nodes are isolated from the bitlines with these techniques, thereby significantly enhancing the read stability as compared to the standard 6 T SRAM circuits.

The read stability of the 9 T and the 8 T SRAM cells is 80% higher as compared to a standard 6T SRAM cell sized for data stability (with beta = 3) in a 65 nm CMOS technology.

Values of the 8 prediction samples are close to the values of the original prediction samples. For 16\u00d716 luma and chroma blocks, the algorithm uses directions of each mode and it reduces the number of possible prediction modes from 4 to 2. Overall, the algorithm reduces the number of possible prediction modes from 17 to 8. Experimental results show that the algorithm has less degradation of peak signal-to-noise ratio than those of existing algorithms.

To control the asynchronous data flow between stages, an intelligent controller is designed which decides the delay of each stage depending upon the magnitude of the input data (Data Dependent Delay). The intelligent controller has been designed using NIOS II soft core embedded processor in ALTERA EP2C20F484C7 device. But, in this approach, the maximum operating frequency is limited by the excess of logical elements consumed by the microcontroller and the sequential execution of the C code. Hence, the function of NIOS processor to control asynchronous data flow alone has been chosen and is implemented as an equivalent hardware INTASYCON (INTelligent ASYnchronous CONtroller) using hardware description language and the speed of the circuit was evaluated. To verify the efficacy of the proposed approach, 8times8 Braun array multiplier is implemented as external logic to the INTASYCON. The INTASYCON processor calculates the completion time of each stage (based on the logic depth) and accordingly activates the respective dual edge triggered flipflops to transfer data from one stage to next stage. This approach consumes lower power and also avoids the need for global clock signals and their consequences like skew problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808358/4815559/04815633.pdf","startPage":"I-304","endPage":"I-309","publicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based asynchronous pipelined multiplier with intelligent delay controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Logic arrays","Digital systems","Pipeline processing","Frequency","Microcontrollers","Process control","Hardware design languages","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","frequency multipliers","microcontrollers","parallel processing","pipeline arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based asynchronous pipelined multiplier","intelligent delay controller","NIOS II soft core embedded processor","ALTERA EP2C20F484C7 device","microcontroller","C code","hardware description language","Braun array multiplier","INTASYCON processor","completion time","dual-edge triggered flipflops","global clock signals","skew problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Asynchronous Pipeline","Low Power","Data Dependent Delay","INTASYCON"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based asynchronous pipelined multiplier with intelligent delay controller","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/4815633/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10574212","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based asynchronous pipelined multiplier with intelligent delay controller","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"15.5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056987S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808358","isNumber":"4815559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4815559","articleId":"4815633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4815635,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A wider objective is used to find novel solutions to design such complex architectures so that system functionality and performance may not be compromised. Design automation using reconfigurable hardware and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), is one of the methods to tackle this issue. This concept applies the notion of Evolvable Hardware (EHW) to the problem domain such as novel design solutions and circuit optimization. EHW is a new field about the use of EA to synthesize a circuit. EA manipulates a population of individuals where each individual describes how to construct a candidate for a good circuit. Each circuit is assigned a fitness, which indicates how well a candidate satisfies the design specification. EA uses stochastic operators repeatedly to evolve new circuit configurations from existing ones, and a resultant circuit configuration will exhibit a desirable behavior. In this paper, optimum circuit design by using GA with fitness function composed of circuit complexity, power and time delay is proposed, and its effectiveness is shown by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815652","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808358/4815559/04815652.pdf","startPage":"I-383","endPage":"I-386","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for circuit design optimization using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for circuit design optimization using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"01","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10574231","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4815652/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for circuit design optimization using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"18.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808358","isNumber":"4815559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4815559","articleId":"4815652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4815657,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hyun Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Hyun Hwang","id":"37088074874"},{"name":"Seong-Gwon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong-Gwon Lee","id":"37088077165"},{"name":"Jong-Wook Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Wook Lee","id":"37087257710"},{"name":"Byung-Sung Kim","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Sung Kim","id":"37087150532"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2598-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2599-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4815657","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","MOSFETs","Millimeter wave technology","CMOS technology","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave radar","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Millimeter wave transistors","Frequency","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","copper","integrated circuit metallisation","millimetre wave power amplifiers","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave CMOS power amplifiers","common-source MOSFETs","Q-band amplifier","Ka-band amplifier","copper metallization","system-on-chip","frequency 40 GHz","frequency 27 GHz","size 0.13 mum","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter-wave","CMOS","power amplifier","substrate-shield-line"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, CMOS millimeter-wave power amplifiers operating at Q-band (40 GHz) and Ka-band (27 GHz) are presented.

The algorithms based on conventional mathematics can be simplified and even optimized by the use of Vedic Sutras. These methods and ideas can be directly applied to trigonometry, plain and spherical geometry, conics, calculus (both differential and integral), and applied mathematics of various kinds. In this paper new multiplier and square architecture is proposed based on algorithm of ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics, for low power and high speed applications.

The motion compensation is the most time-consuming and complex unit in the H.264 decoder. The performance of the motion compensation is determined by the calculation of pixel interpolation and management of the reference pixels. The reference pixels read from external memory and efficient memory management for data reuse is necessary. We propose the architecture of a motion compensation for H.264 decoders. It is composed of 2-dimensional circular register files, a motion vector predictor and interpolators with dual-channel pipelined processing elements. The processing elements can interpolate integer-, half- and quarter-pixel data. The 2-dimensional circular register files reuse reference pixel data as much as possible, and feed reference pixel data to interpolators without any latency and complex logic circuits. The motion compensation unit has dual processing pipelines for luminance and chroma data.

The recent increase of process variation, however, made it too difficult to predict the circuit timing accurately using traditional deterministic methods. Many statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) approaches have been proposed to deal with the impact of large process variation effectively. However, most of them focused on the gate-level design, and those for macro-level designs have not been well developed yet. This paper investigates the validity of applying SSTA to the macro-level designs by presenting preliminary experimental results that compare SSTA and the worst-case corner timing analysis in accuracy. In addition, this paper investigates how the process variation affects the usefulness of the macro-level SSTA.","doi":"10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815715","publicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International SoC Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4808358/4815668/04815715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCDC.2008.4815715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815668","startPage":"II-187","endPage":"II-190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of using the statistical timing analysis software for the VLSI design at the macro level","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of using the statistical timing analysis software for the VLSI design at the macro level","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"02","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10574293","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4815715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of using the statistical timing analysis software for the VLSI design at the macro level","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063534S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4808358","isNumber":"4815668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4808358","xplore-issue":"4815668","articleId":"4815715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4815730,"authors":[{"name":"Moonmo Koo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moonmo Koo","id":"38068888400"},{"name":"Soo-Ik Chae","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soo-Ik Chae","id":"37274400900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2598-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2599-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4815730","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"In this paper, we explain a configurable IPC module for multimedia MPSoCs, which was implemented in a MPW chip that include three ARM7 CPU cores.

Additional shunt reactances for an output power back off efficiency peaking, as they are required for the standard Chireix combiners, are eliminated. The circuits are based on two transmission lines with different line lengths and allow compact implementations.

The equivalent circuit for the chassis radiator is derived from the flat dipole equivalent circuit by exclusion of the parasitic feed inductor and shunt capacitance and by short-circuiting the de-embedded terminals. In employing equivalent circuit elements based on measured impedance of a flat dipole, the partitioning of parasitic and \"dipole\" inductance is achieved by application of the theoretical resonance (eigen-) frequency of the chassis mode. In a more general equivalent circuit model the impedance level can be chosen arbitrarily, only enforcing the theoretical resonance frequency and Q-factor of the chassis mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 German Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813137/4815844/04815895.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 German Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/GEMIC.2009.4815895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEMIC.2009.4815895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent-Circuit Modelling of Chassis Radiator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equivalent circuits","Resonance","Resonant frequency","Feeds","Inductors","Shunt (electrical)","Parasitic capacitance","Impedance measurement","Inductance measurement","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","electric impedance","equivalent circuits","inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent-circuit modelling","chassis radiator","flat dipole","rectangular chassis eigen-mode","impedance","inductance","Q-factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent-Circuit Modelling of Chassis Radiator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10574380","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent-Circuit Modelling of Chassis Radiator","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"GEMIC-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040741S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813137","isNumber":"4815844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813137","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4815844","articleId":"4815895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4815897,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sahaya Kulandai Raj","affiliation":["Institute of High-Frequency Technology, Braunschweig University of Technology, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Joseph Sahaya Kulandai","lastName":"Raj","id":"37270761300"},{"name":"Joerg Schoebel","affiliation":["Institute of High-Frequency Technology, Braunschweig University of Technology, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Schoebel","id":"37298981900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-9812668-0-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8007-3150-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-8022"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-8030"}],"articleNumber":"4815897","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the capacity of a 60 GHz MIMO system in an indoor environment using ray tracing as simulation methodology. Here, the LOS MIMO (line-of-sight MIMO) is proposed to be used because of limited scattering at 60 GHz due to directive antennas. Sometimes, the receiver will not get the LOS component because of possible human movement in the indoor environment. In this situation, the MIMO transmission via reflected paths using switched beam elements is investigated. In another case where switched beam antennas could be useful is when the receiver is moved from the broadside direction of the transmitter. Here the receiver will get the LOS component, but not through the main beam direction of the static unidirectional antennas. It is also a part in this paper to show as to how the switched beam antennas help the receiver to get the beam maximum and boost the capacity. The benefits are graphically shown with the help of computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 German Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813137/4815844/04815897.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 German Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/GEMIC.2009.4815897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEMIC.2009.4815897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched beam antennas as elements of 2\u00d72 MIMO in indoor environment at 60 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directional antennas","MIMO","Indoor environments","Directive antennas","Ray tracing","Analytical models","Scattering","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","indoor radio","millimetre wave antennas","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched beam antennas","MIMO system","indoor environment","ray tracing","line-of-sight MIMO","directive antennas","static unidirectional antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LOS MIMO at 60 GHz","Capacity and Switched beam antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Switched beam antennas as elements of 2\u00d72 MIMO in indoor environment at 60 GHz","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10574382","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched beam antennas as elements of 2\u00d72 MIMO in indoor environment at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"GEMIC-00-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08355S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813137","isNumber":"4815844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813137","xplore-issue":"4815844","articleId":"4815897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4815900,"authors":[{"name":"Andrzej Samulak","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Samulak","id":"37547751500"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Technische Elektronik, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-9812668-0-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8007-3150-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-8022"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-8030"}],"articleNumber":"4815900","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Gallium nitride","Frequency","Circuit simulation","Pulse amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Switches","Signal analysis","Pulse modulation","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical resistivity","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","nonlinear network analysis","power amplifiers","transistors","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear analysis","class-S power amplifiers","switching transistors","nonlinearity resistance","nonlinearity resistance","carrier frequency","frequency 890.88 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-S amplifier","Delta Sigma Modulation","GaN transistors","Power amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815900","abstract":"A Class-S Amplifier architecture theoretically offers high efficiency and nonlinearity resistance.

This treatment allows realistic packaging and emitter-placement studies to be parametrically performed by incorporating the relationship between temperature and output power/efficiency for each emitter. In this respect, once the temperature behavior of a single emitter is quantified, the operating temperature and output power performance can be accurately predicted for any realistic physical arrangement of laser array and packaging.

Starting from general nonlinear gain equations, an analytic description of the Bogatov-like effect is derived in terms of gain coefficients. These equations are used to explain the results of fully numerical simulations. The data signal's ER improves because of a two-step process. First, the data signal cross-gain modulates the additionally injected CW signal. Second, due to this inverse modulation, the data signal's states are differently amplified via the Bogatov-like effect. Since the ER improvement is caused by the fast intraband effects, this simple scheme has the potential for high-speed regeneration.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2009.2013113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2009.2013113","startPage":"629","endPage":"636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4815927/04815928.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extinction Ratio Improvement Due to a Bogatov-Like Effect in Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Extinction Ratio Improvement Due to a Bogatov-Like Effect in Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815928/","accessionNumber":"10600953","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815928/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extinction Ratio Improvement Due to a Bogatov-Like Effect in Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jqe-runge-2013113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064071S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4815927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4815927","articleId":"4815928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4815932,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Ramdasrao Watekar","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4815931/4815932/4815932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pramod Ramdasrao Watekar was born in Falegaon, Yavatmal district, India.

The analytical results are in very good agreement with those obtained by the FEA, considering both amplitude and waveform.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2013245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4815957/04815989.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2013245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Solution of the Magnetic Field in Permanent-Magnet Motors Taking Into Account Slotting Effect: No-Load Vector Potential and Flux Density Calculation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4815989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4815989/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Solution of the Magnetic Field in Permanent-Magnet Motors Taking Into Account Slotting Effect: No-Load Vector Potential and Flux Density Calculation","volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10575103","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4815989/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Solution of the Magnetic Field in Permanent-Magnet Motors Taking Into Account Slotting Effect: No-Load Vector Potential and Flux Density Calculation","sourcePdf":"tmag-dubas-2013245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083286S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4815957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"4815957","articleId":"4815989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4815993,"authors":[{"name":"Hsi-Fu Shih","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsi-Fu","lastName":"Shih","id":"37267892600"},{"name":"Wei-Chih Lu","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Photonics, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chih","lastName":"Lu","id":"38189454900"},{"name":"Jenq-Yang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Photonics, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jenq-Yang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280551400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4815993","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Single-Path Optical Pickup Head With Three Wavelengths Using Integrated Optical Unit","abstract":"For the purpose of backward compatibility to the CD and DVD specifications, the optical pickup head (OPH) design with multiple laser wavelengths and numerical apertures (NAs) is necessary for the Blu-ray Disc (BD) system.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated empirically on a commercial hard disk drive where the adaptive disturbance rejector is added to a baseline linear time-invariant (LTI) controller. The adaptive scheme can be broken into two subsystems: one subsystem is designed to suppress the repeatable runout (RRO) and the other to attenuate the residual disturbance and nonrepeatable runout (NRRO) by the use of radial basis functions. Two different methods for RRO suppression are employed in conjunction with the neural-networks-based NRRO rejector. The first one is an adaptive feedforward disturbance rejection scheme. The second is a repetitive controller. In both cases the neural modeled disturbance rejector is adapted online further increasing the track-following performance by as much as 6.4%. Experimental results of the schemes at various locations of the hard drive are included to demonstrate the general applicability of the approach on commercial drives. The total reduction of the error during track-following is measured to be as much as 25.4% respect to the baseline LTI controller.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2013339","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2013339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815957","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4815957/04816000.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural-Networks-Based Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Method and Its Application to the Control of Hard Disk Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816000/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural-Networks-Based Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Method and Its Application to the Control of Hard Disk Drives","volume":"45","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4816000/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10575106","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural-Networks-Based Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Method and Its Application to the Control of Hard Disk Drives","sourcePdf":"tmag-jlevin-2013339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089989S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4815957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4815957","articleId":"4816000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4816002,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Seok Choi","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Seok","lastName":"Choi","id":"38184324100"},{"name":"Jeonghoon Yoo","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghoon","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37279579000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4816002","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816002","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Actuators","Genetic algorithms","Magnetic flux","Convergence","Character generation","Biological cells","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Magnetic domains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic actuators","genetic algorithms","magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic actuators","structural topology optimization","genetic algorithms","ON/OFF sensitivity","blurring technique","magnetic flux flow","2D chromosomes","geographic crossover","yoke optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-element analysis","genetic algorithm","structural connectivity","topology optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016297","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4815960/04816002.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural Topology Optimization of Magnetic Actuators Using Genetic Algorithms and <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">ON/OFF</emphasis> Sensitivity","abstract":"In genetic algorithm (GA) based topology optimization problems, characteristics of an initial population are important for the rapid and stable convergence.

For the successful releasing during UV nanoimprinting process, self assembled monolayer of fluoroctatrichlorosilane was deposited on the original silicon master. With this approach, the expensive silicon master could be reused many times as a master mold. Nickel seed layer as conductive layer was deposited onto the polymeric master using sputtering process.

The focus was first directed toward the definition and validation of the proposed model through comparisons between simulations and measurements for high electrical field excitation amplitudes on a large frequency bandwidth (major hysteresis loops, measured over 4 decades). Subsequently, the same comparisons were made under ultra-weak as well as weak electric fields. Large frequency bandwidths were tested in each case, and it was shown that the fractional term provided a very accurate modeling of the dynamic behavior of the ferroelectrics.

Three-dimensional solutions of the equation are verified with water tank measurements of a commercial diagnostic ultrasound transducer and are shown to be in excellent agreement in terms of the fundamental and harmonic acoustic fields and the power spectrum at the focus. The linear and nonlinear components of the algorithm are also verified independently. In the linear nonattenuating regime solutions match results from Field II, a well established software package used in transducer modeling, to within 0.3 dB. Nonlinear plane wave propagation is shown to closely match results from the Galerkin method up to 4 times the fundamental frequency. In addition to thermoviscous attenuation we present a numerical solution of the relaxation attenuation laws that allows modeling of arbitrary frequency dependent attenuation, such as that observed in tissue. A perfectly matched layer (PML) is implemented at the boundaries with a numerical implementation that allows the PML to be used with high-order discretizations. A -78 dB reduction in the reflected amplitude is demonstrated. The numerical algorithm is used to simulate a diagnostic ultrasound pulse propagating through a histologically measured representation of human abdominal wall with spatial variation in the speed of sound, attenuation, nonlinearity, and density. An ultrasound image is created in silico using the same physical and algorithmic process used in an ultrasound scanner: a series of pulses are transmitted through heterogeneous scattering tissue and the received echoes are used in a delay-and-sum beam-forming algorithm to generate a images. The resulting harmonic image exhibits characteristic improvement in lesion boundary definition and contrast when compared with the fundamental image. We demonstrate a mechanism of harmonic image quality improvement by showing that the harmonic point spread function is less sensitive to reverberation clutter.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4816043/04816057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816043","startPage":"474","endPage":"488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heterogeneous nonlinear attenuating full- wave model of ultrasound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A heterogeneous nonlinear attenuating full- wave model of ultrasound","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10587910","pubMedId":"19411208","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4816057/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heterogeneous nonlinear attenuating full- wave model of ultrasound","sourcePdf":"t0930474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064646S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4816043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4816043","articleId":"4816057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4816058,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Montaldo","affiliation":["Laboratoire Ondes et Acoustique, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique et chimie Industrielles (ESPCI), INSERM, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4816043/4816058/4816058-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriel Montaldo was born in 1972 in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4816043/04816058.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent plane-wave compounding for very high frame rate ultrasonography and transient elastography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Coherent plane-wave compounding for very high frame rate ultrasonography and transient elastography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816058/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587911","pubMedId":"19411209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4816058/","volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent plane-wave compounding for very high frame rate ultrasonography and transient elastography","sourcePdf":"t0930489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115732S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4816043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"920","xplore-issue":"4816043","articleId":"4816058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4816062,"authors":[{"name":"Abigail Swillens","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Technology, Ghent University, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4816043/4816062/4816062-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abigail Swillens was born in Ghent, Belgium, in 1983.

Ultrasound simulations of realistic Doppler signals require accurate modeling of blood flow. Instead of using analytically described flow behavior, complex blood movement can be derived from velocity fields obtained with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By further modeling blood as a collection of point scatterers, resulting RF-signals can be efficiently retrieved using an existing ultrasound simulation model. The main aim of this paper is to elaborate on creating CFD-based phantoms for ultrasound simulations. The coupling of a computed flow field with an ultrasound model offers flexible control of flow and ultrasound imaging parameters, beneficial for improving and developing imaging algorithms. The proposed method was validated in a straight tube with a stationary parabolic velocity profile and further demonstrated by an eccentrically stenosis carotid bifurcation. The estimated flow velocities are in good agreement with the CFD reference, both for color flow imaging and pulsed-wave doppler simulations.

By using approximate viscoelastic Green's functions, investigations of the properties of the propagated shear-field component at the fundamental modulation frequency were previously reported by our group. However, high-amplitude source excitations may be needed to increase the signal-to-noise-ratio for shear-wave detection in tissue. This paper reports a study of the generation and propagation of dynamic radiation force components at harmonics of the modulation frequency for conditions that generally correspond to diagnostic safety standards. We describe the propagation characteristics of the resulting harmonic shear waves and discuss how they depend on the parameters of nonlinearity, focusing gain, and absorption. For conditions of high viscosity (believed to be characteristic of soft tissue) and higher modulation frequencies, the approximate shear wave Green's function is inappropriate. A more exact viscoelastic Green's function is derived in k-space, and using this, it is shown that the lowpass and dispersive effects, associated with a Voigt model of tissue, are more accurately represented. Finally, it is shown how the viscoelastic properties of the propagating medium can be estimated, based on several spectral components of the shearwave spectrum.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Viscosity","Elasticity","Green's function methods","Frequency modulation","Narrowband","Optical modulation","Interference","Ultrasonic imaging","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomechanics","elastic waves","Green's function methods","viscoelasticity","viscosity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite amplitude radiation force","viscoelastic medium","tissue","confocal quasi-CW ultrasound beams","Green's functions","high-amplitude source excitations","signal-to-noise ratio","modulation frequency","diagnostic safety standards","harmonic shear waves","viscosity","low-pass effect","dispersive effect","Voigt model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Elasticity Imaging Techniques","Least-Squares Analysis","Models, Statistical","Models, Theoretical","Pressure","Temperature","Viscosity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4816043/04816065.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of shear waves generated by a modulated finite amplitude radiation force in a viscoelastic medium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Propagation of shear waves generated by a modulated finite amplitude radiation force in a viscoelastic medium","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816065/","volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4816065/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587918","pubMedId":"19411216","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of shear waves generated by a modulated finite amplitude radiation force in a viscoelastic medium","sourcePdf":"t0930575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074963S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4816043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4816043","articleId":"4816065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4816070,"authors":[{"name":"Subramanian K.

We compare the F-SAW device to a conventional SAW device with similar substrate dimensions and transducer finger periodicity. SAW devices with concentrically shaped focused interdigital transducer fingers (F-IDTs) are found to excite waves with high intensity and high beam-width compression ratio, confined to a small localized area. F-SAW devices are more sensitive to amplitude variations at regions close to the focal point than conventional SAW devices having uniform IDT configuration. We compute F-SAW induced streaming forces and velocity fields by applying a successive approximation technique to the Navier-Stokes equation (Nyborg's theory). The maximum streaming force obtained at the focal point varies as the square of the applied input voltage. Computed streaming velocities at the focal point in F-SAW devices are at least an order of magnitude higher than those in conventional SAW devices. Simulated frequency response indicates higher insertion losses in F-SAW devices than in conventional devices, reflecting their greater utility as actuators than as sensors. Our simulation findings suggest that F-SAW devices can be utilized effectively for actuation in microfluidic applications involving diffusion limited transport processes.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4816043/04816070.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical analysis of wave generation and propagation in a focused surface acoustic wave device for potential microfluidics applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816070/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical analysis of wave generation and propagation in a focused surface acoustic wave device for potential microfluidics applications","volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10587923","pubMedId":"19411221","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4816070/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical analysis of wave generation and propagation in a focused surface acoustic wave device for potential microfluidics applications","sourcePdf":"t0930631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092181S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4816043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4816043","articleId":"4816070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4816078,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-5865-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4816078","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":28096},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE-SASB Coordinating Committees"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE Standards","Interconnected systems","Distributed databases","Diesel engines","Power distribution","Energy storage","Photovolltaic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","IEEE standards","power system interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE application guide","IEEE Std 1547-2003","distributed resource interconnection","electric power systems","DR project implementation","Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1547.2-2008","diesel generators","dispersed generation","distributed energy","distributed energy resources","distributed generation","distributed power","distributed resources","electric distribution systems","electric power systems","energy storage","Federal","fuel cells","grid","interconnection","inverter","islanding","microturbines","national","networks","paralleling","photovoltaic power systems","rulemaking","regional","state","utility","wind energy systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4816078","startPage":"1","endPage":"217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 1547.2-2008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 1547.2-2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816076/4816077/04816078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4816078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1547.2-2008 - IEEE Application Guide for IEEE Std 1547(TM), IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems","abstract":"In this paper, technical background and application details to support understanding of IEEE Std 1547-2003 are provided.

This new approach significantly reduces the layout area of current-mode DACs by the virtue of its compact size. The proposed DAC can replace the write driver circuits in phase change memories. Both 6-bit and 12-bit DACs have been fabricated in 0.5 mum CMOS technology.

The proposed algorithm uses single-slope ramp ADC timing on a column-parallel CMOS image sensor. Single-slope look-ahead ramp (SSLAR) ADC algorithm introduces code hopping, fall back, and look-ahead operations considering statistical distribution of the sampled row of information on column sample and hold circuits. The algorithm was run on a number of standard images for performance comparison. It was also run on 300 random images to get speed and jump step trends. It was determined that the algorithm results in increased ADC speed; improving frame rate of the CMOS image sensor without degrading image quality. The new ADC provides 1.7times to 3.5times ADC speed improvement with less than 1.0% image quality degradation which a normal human eye cannot detect. Algorithm trades ADC speed and power consumption with image quality. The proposed algorithm shortens ADC conversion time resulting in reduced power consumption and increased frame rate of the column-parallel CMOS image sensor.","doi":"10.1109/WMED.2009.4816152","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816120/4816121/04816152.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMED.2009.4816152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816121","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Single-Slope Look-Ahead Ramp (SSLAR) ADC for Column Parallel CMOS Image Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4816152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Slope Look-Ahead Ramp (SSLAR) ADC for Column Parallel CMOS Image Sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-3 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4816152/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-3 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10613967","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4816152/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Slope Look-Ahead Ramp (SSLAR) ADC for Column Parallel CMOS Image Sensors","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"4.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052847S","chronDate":"3-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4816120","isNumber":"4816121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816120","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4816121","articleId":"4816152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
